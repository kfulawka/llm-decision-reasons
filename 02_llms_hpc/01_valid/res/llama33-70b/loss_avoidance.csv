To solve this decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason focuses on the probability of losses in each lottery. A loss is considered as receiving less than the maximum possible amount in each lottery, but for simplicity in this context, we'll consider a loss as receiving 0 Euros since that's the only explicit loss condition given.

For Lottery A, the probability of a loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 1%. 
For Lottery B, since the only outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability, there's no chance of receiving 0 Euros, thus the probability of a loss is 0%.

Given this, we can derive the relevant information needed for the decision reason, which is the probability of losses for each lottery. Therefore, we can proceed to apply the decision reason.

Applying the decision reason, we compare the probabilities of losses:
- Lottery A has a 1% probability of loss.
- Lottery B has a 0% probability of loss.

Since 0% is less than 1%, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has the overall lower probability of loss.

1,"STEPS: 
To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied**: The decision reason is based on the probabilities of losses of each lottery. Since the probabilities of winning and losing (or getting 0 Euros, which can be considered a loss in this context) are provided for both lotteries, we can apply this reason. The relevant information is the probability of losing (getting 0 Euros) in each lottery.

2. **Summarize the relevant information**: 
   - Lottery A has a 67% probability of loss (0 Euros).
   - Lottery B has a 66% probability of loss (0 Euros).

3. **Apply the decision reason**: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. By comparing the probabilities:
   - Lottery A has a 67% probability of loss.
   - Lottery B has a 66% probability of loss.
   Since 66% is less than 67%, Lottery B has a lower probability of loss.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower probability of loss, Lottery B is preferred over Lottery A.

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of losses of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to determine the probability of loss for each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 20%.
For Lottery B, since it offers 3000 Euros with 100% probability, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 0%.
The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss.
Lottery A has a 20% probability of loss.
Lottery B has a 0% probability of loss.
Since 0% is less than 20%, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of losses of each lottery. Since the probabilities of losses (or not winning) are directly provided in the lotteries' descriptions, we can apply the decision reason.

The relevant information about the lotteries is as follows:
- Lottery A has a loss probability of 80% (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a loss probability of 75% (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros).

Next, we apply the decision reason. The reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. By comparing the loss probabilities:
- Lottery A has an 80% probability of loss.
- Lottery B has a 75% probability of loss.

Since 75% is less than 80%, Lottery B has a lower probability of loss compared to Lottery A. According to the decision reason, the preferred lottery is the one with the lower probability of loss, which in this case is Lottery B.

To solve this problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of losses of each lottery. Given that the probabilities of losing (receiving 0 Euros) in both lotteries are explicitly stated, we can derive the relevant information needed to apply the decision reason.

The probability of loss in Lottery A is 55%, and the probability of loss in Lottery B is 10%. Since we have the necessary information to compare the probabilities of losses directly, we can proceed to apply the decision reason.

Next, we apply the decision reason to the decision problem. The reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. By comparing the probabilities of loss:
- Lottery A has a 55% probability of loss.
- Lottery B has a 10% probability of loss.

Since 10% is less than 55%, Lottery B has the lower probability of loss. Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred over Lottery A.

STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. This involves evaluating whether the relevant information, which in this case is the probability of loss for each lottery, can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

1. **Assessing Applicability**: The decision reason focuses on the probability of loss. For Lottery A, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 50%. For Lottery B, since the outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 0%.

The relevant information for the decision reason is as follows:
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of a loss (-1000 Euros) and a 50% probability of no loss (0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of a loss (-500 Euros).

Next, we apply the decision reason to the decision problem. The reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. 
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of loss.
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of loss.

Since 50% is less than 100%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a lower probability of loss.

12,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of losses of each lottery, so we need to determine the probability of loss for each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 75%. 
For Lottery B, the probability of loss (receiving 0 Euros) is 50%. 
Since we can derive the relevant information (probabilities of losses) from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss.

To solve this problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied to the given decision problem. The decision reason is based on the probability of losses, which can be directly derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner.

Next, we calculate the overall probability of loss for each lottery:
- For Lottery A, the probability of loss is 25% because there is a 25% chance of losing 6000 Euros, and the rest (75%) is not a loss (0 Euros).
- For Lottery B, we need to consider both losses: losing 4000 Euros and losing 2000 Euros. The probability of losing 4000 Euros is 25%, and the probability of losing 2000 Euros is also 25%. Since these are mutually exclusive events (they cannot happen at the same time), we add their probabilities to get the total probability of any loss, which is 25% + 25% = 50%.

Now, we apply the decision reason. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. Lottery A has a 25% probability of loss, while Lottery B has a 50% probability of loss. Since 25% is less than 50%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

To solve this problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied to the given decision problem in a strict manner. The decision reason considers the probabilities of losses of each lottery, which can be derived from the information provided about the lotteries. Therefore, we can proceed with applying the decision reason.

Next, we need to summarize the information about the lotteries that is relevant to the decision reason. For Lottery A, there is a 99.9% probability of losing (receiving 0 Euros) and a 0.1% probability of winning (receiving 5000 Euros). For Lottery B, there is a 0% probability of losing in the context of receiving less than the guaranteed amount, since it offers a guaranteed 5 Euros with 100% probability.

Now, we apply the decision reason to the decision problem. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss. In Lottery A, the probability of loss (getting 0 Euros) is 99.9%. In Lottery B, since it guarantees a win of 5 Euros with 100% probability, the probability of loss (receiving less than the guaranteed amount) is effectively 0%.

Comparing the probabilities of loss, Lottery B has a significantly lower probability of loss (0%) compared to Lottery A (99.9%). Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred over Lottery A because it has the lower probability of loss.
