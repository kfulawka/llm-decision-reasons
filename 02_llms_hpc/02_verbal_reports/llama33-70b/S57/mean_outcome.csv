STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision between Lottery A and Lottery B, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is 2400 / 1 = 2400 Euros. Since the mean of Lottery B (1633.33 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2400 Euros) is actually not true, as 2400 is higher than 1633.33, we must correct this: The mean of Lottery A (2400 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1633.33 Euros). The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has the higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report simply states ""sicherheit,"" which translates to ""safety"" or ""security"" in English. This suggests that the individual's deliberation process focused on the aspect of certainty or risk avoidance rather than explicitly calculating means or comparing expected values. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to be related to the concept of safety, implying a preference for a guaranteed outcome over a gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (safety or security), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. Instead, the focus was on the certainty of the outcome. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not directly align with the individual’s justification for the choice (preference for safety or security). Given this, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 1200 Euros for Lottery A and 1250 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""ähnliche wahrscheinlichkeit"" (similar probability) and ""höherer gewinn möglich"" (higher possible gain), indicating they considered the probabilities and the potential gains of the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the similarity in probabilities and the difference in potential gains, suggesting their deliberation process involved comparing these aspects of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential gains): The individual's focus does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes as described by the decision reason, since they discuss probabilities and potential gains rather than explicitly calculating or comparing mean values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on similar probabilities and higher possible gain): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating means or directly comparing the average outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on probabilities and potential gains suggests a different deliberation process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome would be (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 3000 Euros since there is only one outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher mean outcome (3000 Euros) than Lottery B (2000 Euros) based on this specific calculation method.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sicherer gewinn,"" which translates to ""safe win"" or ""certain gain"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report implies that the individual's focus was on the certainty of the win, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome over a probabilistic one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, while the individual seems to focus on the certainty of the gain. These are different perspectives; the decision reason does not directly account for the certainty of outcomes, only their mean values based on a specific, probability-independent calculation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery A in this incorrect calculation, but based on standard expected value, Lottery B has a higher expected value). The individual's justification seems to prioritize certainty over the mean outcome or expected value, suggesting a different decision-making criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report indicates the individual prioritized the certainty of the gain, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes calculated in a specific, non-standard way that ignores probabilities. The decision reason and the individual's justification for the choice do not match, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of each lottery and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere gewinnchance,"" which translates to ""higher winning chance"" in English. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about the winning chance, implying the individual's decision was based on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their mean) with that considered by the individual (winning chances or probabilities): The individual focused on probabilities, not the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (based on the probability of winning): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes probability rather than mean outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make the decision.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher, the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
The verbal report states ""hohe wahrscheinlichkeit auf gewinn"", which translates to ""high probability of winning"". This indicates that the individual considered the probability of winning when making their decision. The individual’s justification for the choice is not explicitly stated, but it seems to focus on the probability aspect rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning), there is a mismatch. The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of the lotteries, whereas the individual's focus was on the probability of winning. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not align with the individual’s justification (high probability of winning).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere wahrscheinlichkeit auf gewinn,"" which translates to ""higher probability of winning."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning in each lottery.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement implies that the decision was based on comparing the probabilities of winning, without mentioning anything about the magnitude of the outcomes or calculating mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries for calculating mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), we see they are different. The individual focused on probabilities, not on calculating mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher probability of winning), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by summing all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is -3000 / 1 = -3000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome according to this calculation (-2000 > -3000), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""chance auf gewinn,"" which translates to ""chance of winning"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities or chances associated with the outcomes, but it does not explicitly mention calculating means or considering all outcomes equally regardless of probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries based on the described deliberation process. It hints at a consideration of probabilities but does not specify how these probabilities were used in the decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, calculated without considering probabilities. The individual's report hints at considering probabilities (""chance of winning""), which does not directly align with ignoring probabilities as the decision reason does.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, ignoring probabilities. The individual's justification is not clearly stated in terms of mean outcomes or ignoring probabilities, focusing instead on the ""chance of winning,"" which suggests a consideration of probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's consideration of probabilities and the lack of explicit mention of calculating mean outcomes without regard to probability suggest that the decision reason was likely not used as defined.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""weniger verlust,"" which translates to ""less loss"" in English. This indicates the individual considered the aspect of minimizing loss when making their decision. The justification for the choice, as described, focuses on reducing loss without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or comparing the lotteries based on their mean values. However, the concept of ""less loss"" could be related to the idea of preferring a lottery with a lesser negative outcome, which might align with the decision reason's preference for the higher mean outcome (less negative in this context).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (minimizing loss), there's an indirect connection since preferring less loss could conceptually align with preferring a higher mean outcome when all outcomes are negative. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them, which is the core of the decision reason. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) and the individual's justification (preferring less loss) might lead to the same choice in this specific case but are based on different rationales. Given this, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual, as the verbal report does not clearly describe the application of the mean outcome calculation.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual's verbal report is ""verlust minimieren"", which translates to ""minimize loss"". This suggests the individual is focusing on reducing potential losses. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state how the individual justifies their choice, but the focus on minimizing loss implies a consideration of the potential negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which is based on all outcomes. The individual's focus is on minimizing loss, which could imply a consideration of the negative outcomes but does not directly mention calculating means or considering all outcomes equally. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher mean (-1500 Euros vs. -3000 Euros). The individual's justification, as inferred from ""minimize loss"", might align with choosing Lottery B because it has a lower potential loss (-3000 Euros) with a higher probability (90% of not losing), but this does not directly reflect calculating and comparing mean outcomes as the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report suggests a focus on minimizing loss, which could indirectly align with the outcome of the decision reason in this specific case (since Lottery B has both a higher mean outcome and a lower probability of the significant loss). However, the report does not indicate that the individual calculated or compared mean outcomes as the decision reason prescribes. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in potential choice, the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason closely."

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report mentions ""geringeres risiko,"" which translates to ""lower risk"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the risk associated with each lottery when making their decision. The report does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing the lotteries based on their mean values. Instead, it implies a focus on risk, which could be related to the probabilities or the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk), it appears they are focusing on different aspects. The decision reason is based on a calculation that ignores probabilities, while the individual's justification hints at a consideration of risk, which is closely related to the probabilities of the outcomes. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not directly align with the individual's justification (lower risk), as the individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

The individual's justification, however, seems to be based on the certainty of the gain rather than the calculated mean of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the certainty of the gain does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. However, both the decision reason and the individual's justification lead to the preference for Lottery A, but through different rationales.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process described in the verbal report (focusing on the certainty of the gain) does not match the decision reason's process (comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2000) / 1 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""sicherer gewinn, kein risiko,"" which translates to ""safe win, no risk"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the aspect of risk or certainty in the decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on avoiding risk and opting for a certain outcome, implying a preference for a safe choice over a risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, calculated by simply averaging the outcomes. In contrast, the individual's consideration, as expressed, focuses on risk and certainty rather than explicitly on the mean outcomes or their calculation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification, emphasizing a ""safe win"" and ""no risk,"" aligns with choosing Lottery B because it offers a certain gain of 2000 Euros, but this does not directly reflect the calculation of mean outcomes as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report focuses on the aspect of risk and certainty, which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not reflect the specific calculation or consideration of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. Therefore, it appears the decision reason, as specifically defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""sicherer gewinn,"" which translates to ""safe win"" or ""certain gain"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies that the certainty of winning was a key factor, but it does not explicitly state how the individual compared the two lotteries beyond valuing certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome), it appears the individual focused on the certainty of the gain rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (valuing certainty), it seems the individual's decision was based on a different criterion than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros for Lottery A, and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report mentions ""verlustvermeidung,"" which translates to ""loss avoidance"" in English. This indicates the individual considered avoiding losses in their deliberation process. The justification for the choice is not explicitly stated in terms of a specific rule or calculation, but it implies a preference for avoiding negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (avoiding losses), it seems the individual focused on the potential for loss rather than calculating mean outcomes. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not directly align with the individual's justification (avoiding losses), as the mean outcome calculation does not consider the probabilities of the outcomes, and both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros according to the decision reason's calculation method.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on ""verlustvermeidung"" (loss avoidance) and the lack of mention of calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries suggest that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."
