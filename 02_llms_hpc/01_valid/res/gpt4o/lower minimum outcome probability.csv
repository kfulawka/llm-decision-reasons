lower minimum outcome probability
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The relevant information for the decision reason in this problem is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery. 
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros with 33%, 2400 Euros with 66%, and 0 Euros with 1%. The minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%.
- For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros with 100%. The minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.
- This relevant information can be derived from the lottery descriptions, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- According to the decision reason, the lottery with the lower probability of its minimum outcome is preferred. 
- For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 1%.
- For Lottery B, the probability of the minimum outcome (2400 Euros) is 100%.
- Since 1% probability (Lottery A) is lower than 100% probability (Lottery B), the reason prefers Lottery A.
