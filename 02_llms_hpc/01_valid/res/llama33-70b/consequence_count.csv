To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason compares the maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are 2400 Euros because it offers a single outcome with 100% probability. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, we can apply the decision reason.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum = 2500 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum = 2400 Euros, Minimum = 2400 Euros

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes.

1. Comparing maximum outcomes: Lottery A's maximum (2500 Euros) is higher than Lottery B's maximum (2400 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery A.
2. Comparing minimum outcomes: Lottery B's minimum (2400 Euros) is higher than Lottery A's minimum (0 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery B.

Since each lottery has 1 favorable comparison, they are equal in terms of the number of favorable comparisons regarding their maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
1,"STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. 

1. **Assessing Applicability**: The decision reason requires information about the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. From Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. From Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. Since we can derive the relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes) from the lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Information**: 
   - Lottery A: Maximum = 2500 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B: Maximum = 2400 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros

3. **Applying the Decision Reason**: The reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes.
   - Comparison 1: Maximum outcome of A (2500 Euros) vs. Maximum outcome of B (2400 Euros). Since 2500 Euros > 2400 Euros, Lottery A has a favorable comparison.
   - Comparison 2: Minimum outcome of A (0 Euros) vs. Minimum outcome of B (0 Euros). Since 0 Euros = 0 Euros, this comparison is a tie, and neither lottery has a favorable comparison in this aspect.

4. **Determining Preference**: 
   - Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (maximum outcome).
   - Lottery B has 0 favorable comparisons.

Since Lottery A has more favorable comparisons than Lottery B according to the decision reason, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
2,"ABLE WAS REPLACED WITH STEPS TO MATCH THE REQUESTED FORMAT: 
STEPS: 
To solve this decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 3000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome.

We can derive the relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes) from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Now, let's compare the outcomes:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A (4000 Euros) is higher than the maximum outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros). This is one favorable comparison for Lottery A.
- Minimum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) is lower than the minimum outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros). This is one favorable comparison for Lottery B.

Since there is one favorable comparison for each lottery, they are equal in terms of the number of favorable comparisons regarding their maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
3,"STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to identify the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery and then compare them.

1. **Identify Maximum and Minimum Outcomes for Each Lottery:**
   - Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 4000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 3000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros

2. **Compare Maximum Outcomes:**
   - The maximum outcome of Lottery A (4000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (3000 Euros). So, Lottery A has a favorable comparison in terms of maximum outcomes.

3. **Compare Minimum Outcomes:**
   - Both lotteries have the same minimum outcome (0 Euros), meaning neither lottery has a favorable comparison over the other in terms of minimum outcomes.

4. **Apply the Decision Reason:**
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons. Since Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (in maximum outcomes) and Lottery B has 0 favorable comparisons (as it does not surpass Lottery A in either maximum or minimum outcomes), Lottery A is preferred according to this reason.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
4,"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. 
The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. 
The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem. 
To compare, we look at two aspects: the maximum outcome and the minimum outcome. 
- Maximum outcome comparison: Lottery A (6000 Euros) has a higher maximum outcome than Lottery B (3000 Euros). This is one favorable comparison for Lottery A.
- Minimum outcome comparison: Both lotteries have the same minimum outcome (0 Euros), so this comparison is a tie, and neither lottery gets a favorable comparison from this aspect.

Since Lottery A has one favorable comparison (in maximum outcome) and there's a tie in the minimum outcome comparison, Lottery A is preferred by this decision reason because it has a higher number of favorable comparisons than Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
5,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, let's follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, we have the outcomes and their probabilities:
- Lottery A: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
- Lottery B: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 6000 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery A: 0 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 3000 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery B: 0 Euros
Since we can derive the maximum and minimum outcomes for both lotteries, we can apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes.
- Comparison 1: Maximum outcome of Lottery A (6000 Euros) vs. Maximum outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros). Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome.
- Comparison 2: Minimum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) vs. Minimum outcome of Lottery B (0 Euros). Both lotteries have the same minimum outcome, so this comparison is a tie.
Since Lottery A wins one comparison (maximum outcome) and there's a tie in the other (minimum outcome), and there are no other outcomes to compare, Lottery A is considered to have a higher number of favorable comparisons because it wins the only comparison that differentiates the two lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
6,"STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to identify the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery and then compare them.

1. **Identify outcomes for Lottery A**: The maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 20% probability), and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros (with 80% probability).
2. **Identify outcomes for Lottery B**: Since there's only one outcome, it serves as both the maximum and minimum, which is -3000 Euros (with 100% probability).
3. **Compare the outcomes**:
   - **Maximum outcomes comparison**: Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of -3000 Euros. Since 0 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros, Lottery A wins this comparison.
   - **Minimum outcomes comparison**: Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -4000 Euros, and Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -3000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is greater than -4000 Euros, Lottery B wins this comparison.
4. **Apply the decision reason**: The decision reason prefers the lottery that wins more comparisons. In this case, each lottery wins one comparison. Therefore, the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries because neither has a higher number of favorable comparisons.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
7,"STEPS: 
To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. This involves evaluating whether the relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

1. **Assessing Applicability**: The decision reason focuses on comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes between the two lotteries. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. Since we can derive this information directly from the problem statement, the decision reason can be applied.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Information**: 
   - Lottery A: Min = -4000 Euros, Max = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B: Min = -3000 Euros, Max = 0 Euros

3. **Applying the Decision Reason**: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes.
   - **Comparison 1 (Minimum Outcomes)**: Lottery A has a minimum of -4000 Euros, and Lottery B has a minimum of -3000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is greater than -4000 Euros, Lottery B has a favorable comparison in terms of the minimum outcome.
   - **Comparison 2 (Maximum Outcomes)**: Both lotteries have a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, making them equal in this comparison.

4. **Determining Preference**: 
   - Lottery B is preferred in the minimum outcome comparison.
   - Both lotteries are equal in the maximum outcome comparison.
   Since Lottery B has one favorable comparison and there's a tie in the other, it has a higher number of favorable comparisons than Lottery A.

8,"STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to identify the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery and then compare them.

1. **Identify outcomes for Lottery A and Lottery B:**
   - Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 0 Euros, Minimum outcome = -6000 Euros
   - Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 0 Euros, Minimum outcome = -3000 Euros

2. **Compare the maximum outcomes:**
   - Both lotteries have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros. Thus, neither is preferred over the other based on the maximum outcome.

3. **Compare the minimum outcomes:**
   - Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -3000 Euros.
   - Since -3000 Euros is greater than -6000 Euros, Lottery B is considered better in terms of the minimum outcome comparison.

4. **Apply the decision reason:**
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons. 
   - Lottery B is favored in the minimum outcome comparison.
   - Since the maximum outcomes are the same, there's no additional favorable comparison for either lottery beyond the minimum outcome comparison.
   - Therefore, Lottery B is preferred by the decision reason because it has one favorable comparison (in the minimum outcome), and there are no other comparisons that favor Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
9,"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner: 
The decision reason considers comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For both lotteries, the outcomes and their probabilities are provided, allowing for the identification of maximum and minimum outcomes. 
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros and a maximum outcome of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -3000 Euros and a maximum outcome of 0 Euros.
The relevant information can be derived, so we can proceed to Step 2.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
- Comparison of minimum outcomes: Lottery A's minimum outcome (-6000 Euros) is less favorable than Lottery B's minimum outcome (-3000 Euros) because -6000 Euros is less than -3000 Euros.
- Comparison of maximum outcomes: Both lotteries have the same maximum outcome (0 Euros), making this comparison a tie.

Since there is one comparison where Lottery B is more favorable (minimum outcome) and one comparison that is a tie (maximum outcome), and no comparison where Lottery A is more favorable, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher number of favorable comparisons (1) compared to Lottery A (0).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
10,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 500 Euros. Since we can derive the maximum and minimum outcomes for both lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum = 1000 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum = 500 Euros, Minimum = 500 Euros

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we compare the maximum and minimum outcomes between the two lotteries.
1. Compare the maximum outcomes: 1000 Euros (A) vs. 500 Euros (B). Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome.
2. Compare the minimum outcomes: 0 Euros (A) vs. 500 Euros (B). Lottery B has a higher minimum outcome.

Since Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (maximum outcome) and Lottery B has 1 favorable comparison (minimum outcome), they are equal in terms of the number of favorable comparisons.

11,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason compares the maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are -500 Euros because it has a 100% chance of this outcome. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so we can proceed.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
We compare the maximum and minimum outcomes:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) vs. Maximum outcome of Lottery B (-500 Euros): Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome.
- Minimum outcome of Lottery A (-1000 Euros) vs. Minimum outcome of Lottery B (-500 Euros): Lottery B has a higher minimum outcome.

Lottery A wins in one comparison (maximum outcome), and Lottery B wins in one comparison (minimum outcome). Since they each win one comparison and lose one, they are equal in terms of the number of favorable comparisons.

12,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we first need to apply the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
We compare the maximum outcomes: 6000 Euros (Lottery A) vs. 4000 Euros (Lottery B). Since 6000 Euros is greater than 4000 Euros, Lottery A has a favorable comparison for the maximum outcome.
We compare the minimum outcomes: 0 Euros (Lottery A) vs. 0 Euros (Lottery B). Since they are equal, neither lottery has a favorable comparison for the minimum outcome.

Given that Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (for the maximum outcome) and there are no favorable comparisons for the minimum outcome (as they are tied), we need to determine if the decision reason prefers one lottery over the other based on these comparisons.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons. Since Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison and Lottery B has 0 favorable comparisons (because its maximum outcome is less than A's, and the minimum outcomes are equal), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
13,"STEPS: 
To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to identify the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery and then compare them.

1. **Identify outcomes for Lottery A**:
   - Maximum outcome: 0 Euros
   - Minimum outcome: -6000 Euros

2. **Identify outcomes for Lottery B**:
   - Maximum outcome: 0 Euros
   - Minimum outcome: -4000 Euros

3. **Compare the maximum outcomes**:
   - Both lotteries have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros. This means neither lottery is preferred over the other based on the maximum outcome.

4. **Compare the minimum outcomes**:
   - Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -4000 Euros.
   - Since -4000 Euros is greater than -6000 Euros, Lottery B is considered more favorable in terms of the minimum outcome comparison.

5. **Determine preference**:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons.
   - For the maximum outcome, both are equal, so neither is preferred.
   - For the minimum outcome, Lottery B is preferred because its minimum outcome (-4000 Euros) is better than that of Lottery A (-6000 Euros).
   - Since there's only one comparison where one lottery is preferred over the other (the minimum outcome), and Lottery B is preferred in that comparison, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
14,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner to the given decision problem. The decision reason compares the maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries, which can be directly derived from the information provided for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

1. **Identify Maximum and Minimum Outcomes for Each Lottery:**
   - Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 5000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 5 Euros, Minimum outcome = 5 Euros

2. **Apply the Decision Reason:**
   - Compare the maximum outcomes: 5000 Euros (Lottery A) vs. 5 Euros (Lottery B). Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome.
   - Compare the minimum outcomes: 0 Euros (Lottery A) vs. 5 Euros (Lottery B). Lottery B has a higher minimum outcome.

3. **Determine Preference:**
   - Lottery A is preferred for its maximum outcome.
   - Lottery B is preferred for its minimum outcome.
   - Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons and each lottery has one favorable comparison, they are equal in terms of preference based on the given decision reason.

Given that each lottery has one aspect (maximum or minimum outcome) that is preferred over the other, and the decision reason does not specify how to weigh these preferences against each other, we must conclude that the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries because neither has a higher number of favorable comparisons overall.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
15,"STEPS: 
To solve this decision problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are -5 Euros because it has a 100% probability of this outcome. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
We compare the maximum outcomes: 0 Euros (Lottery A) vs. -5 Euros (Lottery B). Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome.
We compare the minimum outcomes: -5000 Euros (Lottery A) vs. -5 Euros (Lottery B). Lottery B has a higher minimum outcome.
Since Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (maximum outcome) and Lottery B has 1 favorable comparison (minimum outcome), they are equal in terms of the number of favorable comparisons.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
16,"STEP 1: Assessing the applicability of the decision reason to the decision problem.

To apply the decision reason, we need to compare the maximum and minimum outcomes between the two lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are 1500 Euros since it has a 100% probability of this outcome.

Relevant information:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 3000 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery A: -3000 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 1500 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery B: 1500 Euros

Since we can derive the necessary information (maximum and minimum outcomes) from the lotteries, we can proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2: Applying the decision reason.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes. Let's compare:

1. Maximum outcome: Lottery A (3000 Euros) has a higher maximum outcome than Lottery B (1500 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery A.
2. Minimum outcome: Lottery A (-3000 Euros) has a lower minimum outcome than Lottery B (1500 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery B.

Each lottery has 1 favorable comparison. Therefore, the decision reason does not prefer one lottery over the other based on the number of favorable comparisons regarding maximum and minimum outcomes.

17,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason compares the maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are 2000 Euros because it has a 100% chance of this outcome. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, we can proceed with the comparison.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- The maximum outcome of Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and the maximum outcome of Lottery B is 2000 Euros. Since 3000 Euros is greater than 2000 Euros, Lottery A has a favorable comparison for the maximum outcome.
- The minimum outcome of Lottery A is -3000 Euros, and the minimum outcome of Lottery B is 2000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is less than 2000 Euros, Lottery B has a favorable comparison for the minimum outcome.
Given these comparisons, Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison (for the maximum outcome), and Lottery B has 1 favorable comparison (for the minimum outcome). They are tied in terms of the number of favorable comparisons.

Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons, and both lotteries have an equal number of favorable comparisons (1 each), the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries.

18,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros (since it has a 100% probability of this outcome). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Relevant information:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 3000 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery A: -3000 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 1000 Euros
- Minimum outcome of Lottery B: 1000 Euros

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
To compare, we look at two aspects: the maximum outcomes and the minimum outcomes.
1. Comparison of maximum outcomes: Lottery A's maximum outcome (3000 Euros) is higher than Lottery B's maximum outcome (1000 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery A.
2. Comparison of minimum outcomes: Lottery A's minimum outcome (-3000 Euros) is lower than Lottery B's minimum outcome (1000 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery B.

Since Lottery A has 1 favorable comparison and Lottery B has 1 favorable comparison, they are tied in terms of favorable comparisons.

19,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcome are 0 Euros, since it has a 100% chance of this outcome. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so we can proceed.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum = 6000 Euros, Minimum = -6000 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum = 0 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
To compare, we look at two aspects: the maximum outcome and the minimum outcome.
- Maximum outcome comparison: Lottery A (6000 Euros) has a higher maximum outcome than Lottery B (0 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery A.
- Minimum outcome comparison: Lottery B (0 Euros) has a higher minimum outcome than Lottery A (-6000 Euros). This is 1 favorable comparison for Lottery B.

Since each lottery has 1 favorable comparison and they are equal in the number of favorable comparisons regarding their maximum and minimum outcomes, the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.
