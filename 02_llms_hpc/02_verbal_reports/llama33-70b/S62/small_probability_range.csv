1,"Lottery B:
2400 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Verbal report:
Auch wenn bei Lotterie A die Wahrscheinlichkeit auf null mit einem prozent sehr gering ist, habe ich mich für Lotterie B entschieden. Der Unterschied des maximal Gewinn zwischen A und B ist ur 100 Euro. Daür gehe ich den, auch wen geringen, Risiko von 0 Euro nicht ein.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum (1%) and maximum (66%) probability is 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% for a single outcome, so the difference between the minimum (which is effectively 0% for the absence of any other outcome) and maximum (100%) probability is 100%. However, given the nature of the reason, it seems to focus on the spread within each lottery's probability distribution rather than comparing to an implicit 0% for outcomes not listed. Thus, for Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the difference is actually 0% (as there's no range within its single outcome probability). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery A: Difference between minimum and maximum probability = 65%
- Lottery B: Difference between minimum and maximum probability = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the low probability (1%) of winning 0 Euros in Lottery A, the maximum gain difference between Lottery A and B (100 Euros), and was aware of the risk associated with Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the low probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery A, they did not want to take the risk (even a small one) of winning 0 Euros for the potential maximum gain difference of 100 Euros between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which was calculated as 65% for Lottery A and effectively considered as 0% for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the risk of winning 0 Euros and the difference in maximum gain, not directly on the probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on avoiding the risk of winning 0 Euros, not directly on the probability differences between the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual chose Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the smaller difference in probability ranges, the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on probability differences. The individual's reasoning was more centered around risk aversion regarding the specific outcome of 0 Euros rather than the probabilistic spread within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report indicates that the decision was made based on different considerations (risk aversion to the 0 Euro outcome and the potential gain difference) rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 66% probability, implying the remaining 34% is the probability of the maximum outcome) and the maximum probability is 34% (for 2400 Euros), with a difference of 34%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 67% probability, implying the remaining 33% is the probability of the maximum outcome) and the maximum probability is 33% (for 2500 Euros), with a difference of 33%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for both lotteries, which is 34% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the lotteries are very similar, with a difference of 100 Euros and 1 percentage point. They consider the higher potential gain of Lottery B and the slightly higher probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B because of the potential for an additional 100 Euros, despite acknowledging that Lottery A offers a 1% higher chance of winning 2400 Euros. The individual feels this 1% increase does not provide enough security to choose Lottery A over the potential higher payout of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is 34% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B. The individual, however, focuses on the difference in potential winnings and the 1% difference in probabilities, not explicitly on the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (33% difference). The individual's justification, however, is based on the potential for higher winnings and the perceived insufficient increase in probability for Lottery A, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's decision is influenced by the difference in potential winnings and the perceived value of the slight increase in probability, rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0% (since there is only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities of winning 4000 Euros (80%) and 0 Euros (20%) in Lottery A, as well as the guaranteed win of 3000 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the difference in amounts between the two lotteries and mentioned a threshold of 1000 Euros. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual preferred a guaranteed win of 3000 Euros over the 20% chance of winning 0 Euros in Lottery A, indicating a preference for certainty over a potential higher gain with some risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, amounts, and the preference for certainty). While the individual did consider the probabilities, there is no explicit mention of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason suggests.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring certainty and being averse to the 20% chance of winning 0 Euros). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the focus is on the certainty of the outcome rather than the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was more on the certainty of the outcome and the potential risk of losing, rather than on the differences in probability ranges between the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implied, as the outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% probability, and the rest, 25%, is for 3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), but since we are looking at the difference between the probabilities of the outcomes, we consider the difference between the probability of the highest outcome and the lowest outcome. Thus, for Lottery A, the relevant probabilities are 25% (for 3000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), giving a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% (for 4000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), giving a difference of 60%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning 0 Euros in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a 5% higher probability of winning 0 Euros than Lottery A. They also considered the difference in the potential winnings (1000 Euros more in Lottery B) and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries (5% higher chance of winning in Lottery A).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because, despite the potential for 1000 Euros less, it offered a 5% higher chance of winning compared to Lottery B. They downplayed the importance of the 1000 Euros difference due to the overall low chances of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual did consider probabilities, their focus was more on the comparative chances of winning and the difference in potential winnings rather than the absolute differences in probabilities between the outcomes of each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, was based on the comparative analysis of potential winnings and the probabilities of those winnings, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual did consider aspects of probability, their decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities, their decision process as described in the verbal report does not closely match the decision reason provided, indicating it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 45% (for winning 6000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 10% (for winning 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and not winning in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the higher probability of not winning in Lottery A and the higher chance of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the perceived risk and the higher chance of winning, specifically preferring the higher probability of a gain in Lottery B over the riskier option of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 10%) over Lottery B (with a difference of 80%). However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived risk and the higher chance of winning, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus in the report is on the risk and the higher chance of winning, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 99.8% and the maximum probability is 0.2%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 99.9% and the maximum probability is 0.1%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the very low probabilities (0.1% and 0.2%) of winning in both lotteries and considers them as very small chances. They also compare the two lotteries based on the assumption of not winning in either case but prefer the higher sum (6000 Euros) associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice of Lottery B by stating they don't expect to win in either case but prefer the higher potential gain of 6000 Euros over 3000 Euros, despite the slightly lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration is more about the absolute probabilities and the potential winnings rather than the differences between the probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.6% difference) over Lottery B (99.8% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on preferring the higher potential gain despite the low probabilities, not on the differences in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B. Instead, the individual focuses on the potential winnings and the low probabilities of winning, without discussing the probability differences within each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (as there's no variation). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A (even with a low probability) and the certainty of a loss in Lottery B. They weigh the potential for no loss against the risk of a higher loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring to risk a higher amount of potential loss in order to have a chance at no loss, rather than accepting a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, which doesn't directly align with the individual's focus on the presence of a no-loss outcome and the risk of higher loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a 0% difference). However, the individual's justification revolves around the potential for avoiding any loss and the risk of higher losses, not explicitly mentioning the probability ranges or their differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the probability differences within each lottery. The individual's decision seems to be more influenced by the presence of a potential no-loss outcome and the avoidance of certain loss, rather than the specific probability ranges of the lotteries.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for -3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities (60% for A and 50% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the negative outcome amounts (-4000 Euros vs. -3000 Euros) and the differences in probabilities (20% vs. 25% for the negative outcomes). They also noted the 5% difference in probabilities between the two lotteries for the negative outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the smaller difference in probabilities (5%) between the lotteries for the negative outcomes as a minor risk and decided to prefer the lottery with the smaller loss amount (-3000 Euros), despite the slightly higher probability of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery (60% for A and 50% for B), while the individual considered the difference in probabilities for the negative outcomes (5% difference between 20% and 25%) and the amount of loss. The individual's focus was not directly on the overall probability differences as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50% difference). The individual's justification, however, was based on the smaller loss amount and the perception of the 5% difference in probabilities as a minor risk, not directly on the overall probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual does consider probabilities and makes a choice based on a form of risk assessment, their justification is more closely tied to the specific outcomes and the comparative risks of those outcomes rather than the overall probability spread of each lottery. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of receiving 0 Euros in both lotteries, noting that Lottery A has a higher probability (55%) of receiving 0 Euros compared to Lottery B (10%). The individual also perceives the 10% probability of receiving 0 Euros in Lottery B as a high risk but notes that the risk of receiving 0 Euros in Lottery A is higher than the risk of losing money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparison of the risks (probabilities of receiving 0 Euros) between the two lotteries, without directly mentioning the differences in probabilities between the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities for each lottery, which the individual does not explicitly mention in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the comparison of the probabilities of receiving 0 Euros in both lotteries rather than the differences in probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 10%. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention this rule or the concept of comparing the differences in probabilities within each lottery.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. In this case, the minimum and maximum probabilities for Lottery A are 0.1% and 99.9%, respectively, and for Lottery B are 0.2% and 99.8%, respectively. The differences are 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B. Since these differences can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning (or losing, in this case) in both lotteries, specifically the 0.1% chance of losing -6000 Euros in Lottery A and the 0.2% chance of losing -3000 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the potential loss amounts.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the higher potential loss in Lottery A (-6000 Euros) was off-putting and the percentage difference (0.1%) was not convincing enough to prefer Lottery A over Lottery B, implying they chose Lottery B because the potential loss, although more likely, was smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not directly considered by the individual in their justification. The individual focused more on the absolute probabilities and the potential losses rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (99.6% vs 99.8%). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these differences as the basis for their choice. Instead, they were influenced by the size of the potential loss and the probabilities of those losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual does choose Lottery B, which aligns with the preference indicated by the decision reason, their justification is based on different factors (the size of the potential loss and its probability). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome, implied by 50% for the 1000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning 1000 Euros in Lottery A as too low and too risky due to the possibility of winning 0 Euros. They also considered the security of getting something from Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the perceived risk and the security of getting a guaranteed amount from Lottery B, implying a preference for certainty over the risk associated with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the risk and security rather than the numerical differences in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, but based on the desire for security and the perceived risk of Lottery A, not explicitly on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's choice and the decision reason both lead to the selection of Lottery B, but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual's decision was based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The justification provided in the verbal report focuses on risk and security, which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason but not the process. Therefore, while the outcome matches, the process described does not clearly align with the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of getting 0 Euros, implying a 0% chance of getting a specific negative outcome, but more accurately, the minimum probability for the stated outcome is 50%, and the maximum is 50%), but considering the context, it's about the difference in probabilities for the outcomes given, which is 50% - 50% = 0% difference in the context of comparing minimum to maximum probability of the same outcome type (loss or no loss). However, interpreting the decision reason strictly, it seems to focus on the range of probabilities for outcomes within each lottery. Since Lottery A has a fixed outcome and Lottery B has two outcomes with equal probabilities, the difference in the minimum and maximum probabilities for Lottery B, based on a strict interpretation of the reason provided, would also be considered as 0% because both outcomes have the same probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a 0% difference between their minimum and maximum probabilities when considering the specific outcomes provided. This makes the decision reason, as described, not directly applicable in a manner that distinguishes between the two lotteries based on the provided probabilities alone, since both effectively have the same difference (0%) under a strict interpretation. However, this step is about assessing if the reason can be applied, and given the nature of the lotteries and the reason, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the reason as described to the given lotteries without considering the actual decision-making process described.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss from each lottery, noting that Lottery B has a higher potential loss but also acknowledges the 50/50 probability. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A due to the fear of a higher loss from Lottery B, despite recognizing the equal probability of outcomes in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which, as interpreted, does not directly apply to distinguishing between these specific lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the potential losses and the probabilities of those losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability does not align with the individual’s justification, which was based on the fear of a higher loss and the recognition of equal probabilities in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason, as interpreted, does not directly apply to the distinction made by the individual, who based their choice on the potential loss and the fear of that loss, rather than the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as described, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference is 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the minimum is 25% and the maximum is 50%, making the difference 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 50%
- Lottery B: Difference = 25%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the low probability of winning in Lottery A (25%) and the higher chance of winning something in Lottery B (50% chance of not going empty-handed).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by expressing concern over the high risk of getting nothing in Lottery A and preferring Lottery B because it offers a higher chance of winning something, even if the amount is less.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, talks about the probabilities of winning and the risk of getting nothing, which relates to but does not directly address the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B but based on the perceived risk and chance of winning something, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly address the decision reason's criteria (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery), and the individual's justification, while resulting in the same choice as the decision reason would suggest, is based on a different consideration (the risk of getting nothing and the chance of winning something). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment in the final choice."
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This step indicates that the decision reason can indeed be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the potential losses of both lotteries, the probabilities of these losses, and the risk associated with each lottery. They were particularly concerned with the high potential loss of Lottery A (-6000 Euros) and the higher probability of experiencing a loss with Lottery B (50% chance of a loss).

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual was torn between taking a higher risk with a potentially higher loss (Lottery A) and a lower risk with a potentially lower loss (Lottery B). However, they ultimately decided based on the perception of risk and the potential for no loss (0 Euros), which seemed to influence their decision towards Lottery A due to a misunderstanding of their own reasoning regarding risks and outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (potential losses, probabilities of losses, and risk perception), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the primary factor.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on potential losses and risk perception), there is no clear indication that the individual applied the decision reason as stated. The individual's decision seems to have been influenced more by the potential magnitude of losses and the perceived risk rather than the specific probability differences between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The focus was more on the potential outcomes and the perceived risk, rather than the specific probability ranges of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 99.8% (or 0.998). For Lottery B, since the probability is 100% for the single outcome, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Thus, according to this reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a difference of 0%, which is smaller than the 99.8% difference of Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low chance of winning in Lottery A and the low amount of money in Lottery B. They seem to consider the trade-off between the high potential reward of Lottery A (despite its low probability) and the guaranteed but low reward of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose Lottery A because they find the potential reward worth the risk, despite acknowledging the low probability of winning. They are not convinced by the low amount offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, but the individual discusses the trade-off between the potential high reward of Lottery A and the certainty of Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning the difference in probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its smaller difference in probabilities (0%), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the potential for a higher reward, not the probability differences within the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the potential outcomes and their personal risk preference rather than the probability differences within each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), so the difference is 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery A, since the outcome is fixed at -5 Euros with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100%, making the difference 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery B, the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery A, and the fact that in Lottery B, the best outcome is 0 Euros (not losing or gaining).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a ""sicherer Weg"" (safer way), implying a preference for the certain loss of 5 Euros over the risk, however small, of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations are more about the outcomes and their associated probabilities rather than the range of probabilities itself.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification is about preferring the safer option due to the potential large loss in Lottery B, not explicitly about comparing the probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the probability range differences. The individual's choice is driven by risk aversion towards the large potential loss, not by comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% probability of a payout in Lottery A and the 50% risk of losing money in Lottery B. They also acknowledged the potential for a higher payout in Lottery B but focused on the risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the 50% risk of losing money in Lottery B was too high, despite the potential for a higher payout. They preferred the certainty of a payout in Lottery A over the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain rather than explicitly discussing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Both lotteries have a difference of 0%, so according to the decision reason, they should be indifferent. However, the individual chose Lottery A because of the certainty and avoidance of risk, not explicitly because of the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's justification was based on the avoidance of risk and the certainty of a payout, not on the comparison of probability differences. Since both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities (0%), the decision reason would not provide a basis for preferring one over the other, but the individual clearly preferred Lottery A for reasons unrelated to the decision reason in question."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences to decide, it's essential to note that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the context of the decision reason suggests looking for a smaller difference as a preference criterion. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money (coming out ""ins Minus"") with Lottery A and the certainty of gaining money with Lottery B, albeit a smaller amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the risk of losing money being more off-putting than the potential for a higher gain, highlighting the attractiveness of the 100% certainty of a positive outcome with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. However, since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not directly apply as a distinguishing factor. The individual's justification, however, was based on the risk and certainty of outcomes rather than the specific probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences, we should note that both lotteries have the same difference of 0%, but the reason essentially looks for the smallest range of probabilities which in a typical interpretation would favor Lottery B for its certainty (100% chance of a single outcome) over the range of outcomes in Lottery A. But technically, both have a ""difference"" of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery A due to its 50/50 probability, indicating they looked at the probability distribution of the outcomes.
Second, the individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning the ""sichere Auszahlung"" (secure payout), implying that the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (risk associated with 50/50 probability in Lottery A and the secure payout of Lottery B), it seems the individual focused more on the certainty aspect rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the probability ranges.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring the secure payout), while the individual's justification aligns with preferring certainty, it doesn't directly mention comparing probability ranges. However, the preference for certainty (Lottery B) over risk (Lottery A) could imply an indirect consideration of the decision reason, as the reason would technically favor Lottery B for its single, certain outcome over the variable outcomes of Lottery A, even though both have a ""difference"" of 0%.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's focus on the certainty of the payout in Lottery B aligns with the general principle of preferring less variability in outcomes, which could be interpreted as aligning with the decision reason's preference for smaller differences in probability. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries, making it uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used. Therefore, the assessment is neutral, indicating uncertainty about whether the decision reason was used or not."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the smaller difference. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% for both outcomes, so the difference is 0% (50% - 50% = 0%). For Lottery B, there is only one outcome with 100% probability, so the difference is also 0% (100% - 0% is not applicable since there's only one outcome, but in the context of comparing differences, it can be considered as 0% since there's no range). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain from each lottery and the risk involved, specifically mentioning the high potential gain from Lottery A and the lack of both gain and loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of the potential for a high gain, despite the risk, indicating a preference for a higher potential reward over a risk-free but reward-less option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which was not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process. The individual focused more on the potential gains and risks.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, but since both lotteries effectively have a difference of 0%, this reason does not differentiate between them. The individual's justification, however, was based on the potential for high gain, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the potential for high gain and the risk involved, rather than on the probability differences between the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
