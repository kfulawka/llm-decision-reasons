STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: minimum outcome of 2400 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 1% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the guaranteed win in Lottery A, the highest possible win in Lottery B being only 100 Euros more than the win in Lottery A, and the risk of not winning anything in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential 100 Euro higher win in Lottery B is not worth the risk of possibly not winning anything, implying that the risk of the lowest outcome in Lottery B was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the risk of the lowest outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implies they preferred Lottery A because it eliminates the risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is present in Lottery B, aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 67%, and for Lottery B, it is 66%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain (2500 Euros for Lottery A vs. 2400 Euros for Lottery B) and noted that the probability of winning in A and B differs by 1 percentage point (33% for A vs. 34% for B), but stated this difference is too small to influence their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a higher potential gain (100 Euros more than Lottery B), and they justified this choice by stating the difference in winning probabilities is negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned as a factor in the individual's decision-making process. The individual focused on the potential gain and the difference in probabilities of winning, not the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (66% probability of 0 Euros) over Lottery A (67% probability of 0 Euros). However, the individual's justification is based on the potential gain and not on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the potential gain and the negligible difference in winning probabilities, not on the probability of the minimum outcome as specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability (since it's a guaranteed outcome). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A has a 20% chance of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 0% chance of receiving less than 3000 Euros, as it guarantees 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) and the risk associated with each lottery, specifically the 20% chance of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by prioritizing a secure win and minimizing risk, indicating that the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A was less important than avoiding the risk of getting 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a secure win, implying a preference for the lottery with a guaranteed outcome over the one with a risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritized avoiding the risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) and chose the lottery that guarantees a win, thus preferring the lottery with the effectively lower probability of the minimum outcome (since Lottery B's minimum outcome is guaranteed and higher than A's minimum).

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 80%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the minimum outcomes: 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of the two lotteries (20% chance of 4000 Euros vs. a slightly higher chance of 3000 Euros) and the potential winnings (4000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros). They mention that the probabilities are close and thus not decisive for their choice, focusing instead on the amount of the potential win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the 20% chance of 4000 Euros over the slightly higher chance of 3000 Euros, primarily because they focus on the amount of the potential win since the probabilities are perceived as being too close to make a difference. They also mention that the second option (0 Euros) in both lotteries is the same and thus not relevant for the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned by the individual as a key factor. Instead, the individual focuses on the potential winnings and the closeness of the probabilities of the positive outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), but the individual's justification is based on the potential winnings and does not explicitly consider the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not the focus of the individual's justification. The individual's focus on the potential winnings and the perceived closeness of the probabilities of the positive outcomes does not reflect the application of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 55%, and in Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 10%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability of winning in Lottery B but notes it is not certain. They also mention the almost 50/50 chance in Lottery A of either winning a high sum or making no gain. The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the win and the magnitude of the potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides against Lottery B because its win, although highly probable, is not guaranteed. They choose Lottery A because of its potential for a high sum and the lack of 100% win certainty in Lottery B, which implies the decision is influenced by the potential gain and the absence of a guaranteed win in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discusses the certainty of the win and the magnitude of the potential gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (10% chance of 0 Euros). However, the individual chooses Lottery A, citing the potential for a high sum and the lack of 100% win certainty in B, not directly aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The verbal report indicates the decision was influenced by the potential gain and the certainty of the win, rather than the probability of the minimum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of this minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.8%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 99.9%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high reward of each lottery and noted that the probability of winning is very low in both cases. They also acknowledged that the alternative outcome in both lotteries is the same (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher reward (Lottery B) because the difference in winning probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) was deemed insignificant, and the higher potential gain in Lottery B was the decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B. However, the individual's consideration was mainly on the higher reward and the insignificance of the probability difference for the winning amounts, not directly on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower probability (99.8%) of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B (99.9%). In contrast, the individual's justification was based on the higher potential gain of Lottery B and not on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual based their choice on the potential for a higher gain and the perceived insignificance of the difference in winning probabilities, rather than on the probability of the minimum outcome. This indicates that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with 80% probability, and for Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 80% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B (20% chance) and the certain loss in Lottery A. The individual focuses on the possibility of no loss in Lottery B and the certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on the probability of a loss and the desire to avoid a certain loss, even if the potential loss in the other lottery is higher. The individual emphasizes the importance of the probability of a loss over the amount of the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of no loss and certain loss), we see that the individual's focus aligns with the decision reason's criteria, as they both consider probabilities related to outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the lottery based on the probability of a loss), there is a clear alignment. The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a chance, albeit small, of not losing anything, which directly relates to having a lower probability of the minimum outcome (in this context, any loss).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions not focusing strongly on probabilities since they didn't seem significantly different. They considered where the loss is the least and made their decision based on that. The individual explicitly states that the difference between 20% and 25% loss probability played no role in their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on minimizing loss, ignoring the specific probabilities of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which the individual seems to ignore in favor of the magnitude of the loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, whereas the individual's justification is about minimizing the loss amount, not its probability.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the decision reason that focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. Instead, they prioritized the magnitude of the potential loss.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and in Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of loss in Lottery B (90%) compared to what they perceived as a roughly 50/50 chance of loss in Lottery A, despite the loss in A being higher.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the thought of participating in a lottery where they would lose 90% of the time (Lottery B) was unappealing, even though the potential loss in Lottery A is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the high probability of loss in Lottery B and the perceived 50/50 chance in Lottery A, which aligns with focusing on the probability of the minimum outcome (loss) in each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over B is based on the lower perceived probability of losing (minimum outcome) in Lottery A compared to the high probability of losing in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's deliberation process and justification for the choice align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on the probability of losing (the minimum outcome) in each lottery and their preference for the lottery with the perceived lower probability of this outcome match the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the probability of a loss in both lotteries is very low and that the difference of 0.1 in the decision does not play a role. They considered where they would make less of a loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on where they would incur a lesser loss, implying a comparison of the potential losses in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (the low probability of loss and the difference in potential losses), we see that the individual's focus aligns with considering the probability of losses, which is related to the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on where they would incur a lesser loss), it appears that the individual's decision process aligns with the principle of minimizing loss probability, as they implicitly considered the lower probability of the more significant loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report suggests that they considered the probabilities of losses and made a decision based on minimizing the loss, which aligns with the decision reason's principle of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual's focus was more on the absolute loss amount rather than strictly on the probability of the minimum outcome, leading to a high but not perfect alignment with the decision reason."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a probability of 0% (since it's 100% to get 500 Euros, the minimum outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 0%), but since the minimum possible outcome is actually 0 Euros for any lottery and the actual minimum outcome in this case is 500 Euros, we consider the probability of getting less than 500 Euros, which is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A: 0% chance of getting the minimum possible outcome of 0 Euros (or less than 500 Euros).
- Lottery B: 50% chance of getting the minimum outcome of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the security of the gain in Lottery A and the higher potential gain in Lottery B but notes the lower chance of achieving it. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because it provides a secure gain, implying a preference for certainty over the potential for a higher but less certain gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the security (certainty) of the gain in Lottery A and the risk (lower chance) in Lottery B. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which is Lottery A (0% chance of getting less than 500 Euros). The individual chooses Lottery A for its security, which can be interpreted as preferring the option with the guaranteed outcome over the risk of getting nothing, aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 50% chance of its minimum outcome (-1000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 100% chance of its minimum outcome (-500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the aspect of not wanting a certain loss and the existence of a chance to avoid losing (or, in this context, to not lose more than they have to).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery A because they did not want to decide on a sure loss, indicating a preference for taking a risk to avoid a guaranteed negative outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which does not directly align with the individual's stated concern about avoiding a sure loss. However, the individual's concern about avoiding a sure loss does relate to the concept of minimizing risk, which could indirectly relate to the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was to avoid a sure loss, which aligns with preferring a lower probability of the worst outcome but does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's reasoning about avoiding a sure loss and taking a risk aligns with the spirit of preferring lower probabilities of negative outcomes, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason does. Therefore, while there's some alignment in the preference for avoiding guaranteed negative outcomes, the direct application of the decision reason as stated is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 75%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a win in each lottery and noted that Lottery A has a higher probability of a win compared to Lottery B, despite B offering a higher potential sum of winnings. The individual also mentions the absence of a loss risk in the ""third option,"" which seems to refer to the structure of the lotteries where one has outcomes with no loss (beyond the 0 Euro outcome).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of a win in Lottery A compared to Lottery B. The individual emphasizes the probability of a win being twice as high in A and the lack of a loss risk as key factors in deciding for A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 50% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. The individual considered the probability of a win, noting it's higher in A, which indirectly relates to the probability of not getting the minimum outcome (0 Euros). However, the individual's focus was more on the positive outcomes rather than directly on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (50% chance of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on a higher probability of a win and the structure of the outcomes, not directly on minimizing the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. While the individual does choose Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's preference due to its lower probability of the minimum outcome, the justification provided in the verbal report emphasizes the probability of winning rather than directly considering the probability of the minimum outcome. Thus, it appears the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice, leading to a low assessment score."
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. In Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 25% probability. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which is 25% for both Lottery A and Lottery B for their respective minimum outcomes. However, considering the structure of the decision reason, it's crucial to note that the minimum outcome in Lottery B also includes a -2000 Euros outcome, but the key comparison for the decision reason is the probability of the worst outcome, which in both cases is tied to the 25% probability of the worst loss (-6000 Euros for A and -4000 Euros for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a loss in each lottery, noting a 25% chance of loss in Lottery A and a 50% chance of any loss (which includes both -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) in Lottery B. They disregarded the actual amounts, focusing on the probability of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the general principle of minimizing the probability of a loss, without considering the magnitude of the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, while the individual considered the probability of any loss. However, in the context of the lotteries provided, the individual's focus aligns with comparing the worst-case scenario probabilities, albeit with a broader definition of ""loss"" that includes any negative outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of its minimum outcome. The individual preferred the lottery with the lower overall probability of experiencing a loss, which aligns with the spirit of minimizing risk as defined by the probability of the worst outcome, even though the individual's definition of ""loss"" encompasses more than just the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's decision process closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on minimizing the probability of the worst outcome, although the individual's consideration of ""any loss"" slightly broadens the definition used by the decision reason. The verbal report indicates a clear preference for minimizing risk based on probabilities, which is the core principle of the decision reason. However, the exact alignment with the decision reason's specific definition of the minimum outcome is not perfectly matched, hence the assessment is high but not certain."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. 
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 
Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possible gain in Lottery B as crucial for their decision and is willing to take the risk of not getting any gain for the chance of a high gain, as they find the sum of 5 Euros too low. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the risk of no gain for a chance at a higher gain over the certainty of a low gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the possible gain in Lottery B and the preference for a higher gain over a certain low gain). 
The individual's focus is on the potential high gain and the risk of no gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. 
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the risk for a higher gain). 
The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual is motivated by the potential high gain rather than the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. The individual's focus on the potential high gain and willingness to take a risk for it, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of a high loss in Lottery A, the possibility of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A, and the certainty of losing a small amount (5 Euros) in Lottery B. They weigh the risk of a high loss against the certainty of a small loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring to be on the ""safe side"" and accepting a small certain loss over the risk of a high loss, even though the probability of the high loss is very low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the risk of the high loss in Lottery A and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification is about avoiding the high-risk outcome, which indirectly suggests preferring the lottery with the lower probability of its minimum outcome (in this case, Lottery B has a 100% chance of its minimum outcome, but it's a much less severe outcome than the minimum of Lottery A).

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report aligns with the logic of preferring the lottery with the lower risk of its minimum outcome, even though the individual's focus is more on the avoidance of the high-risk outcome rather than directly comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes. However, the essence of their decision-making process—focusing on the risk associated with the worst-case scenario—suggests they are considering the probability and impact of the minimum outcomes, albeit with an emphasis on risk aversion rather than a direct calculation of probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 0% probability of any outcome less than 1500 Euros (since it's a guaranteed 1500 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 50% probability of -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 0% probability of any outcome less than 1500 Euros (since the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability)
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the potential loss in Lottery A, finding the amount too high to risk, and viewed the 50/50 chance of high gain or loss as too risky. They also noted that in Lottery B, they would definitely make a gain, with no risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by focusing on the risk of loss in Lottery A and the guaranteed gain in Lottery B, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the potential loss (minimum outcome) in Lottery A and the absence of loss in Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery B because it had no risk of loss (minimum outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lower probability of the minimum outcome (since 0% is less than 50%).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a probability of 100%. 
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 2000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of -3000 Euros with 50% probability.
This information can be used to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B and the certainty of gaining 2000 Euros in Lottery A. 
The individual also considered their goal of maximizing gain but prioritized avoiding a significant loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, whereas Lottery B has a 50% chance of a significant loss, which the individual deemed too risky. 
The individual preferred a guaranteed lower gain (2000 Euros) over a gamble with a potential higher gain but also a risk of significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. 
The individual considered the risk (probability of the minimum outcome) of losing in Lottery B and the certainty of gaining in Lottery A, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
The individual chose Lottery A because it has no risk of loss (or, equivalently, a 0% probability of the minimum outcome of -3000 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual considered the probability of the minimum outcome and preferred the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which is in line with the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability, as there is no possibility of losing. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 0% for a negative outcome in Lottery B (since its minimum outcome is a gain).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and values the security of not losing any money. They mention the importance of a low risk in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because it offers a secure gain without the risk of loss, even though the amount is smaller. They explicitly state that the 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A is not worth the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual’s concern about the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and valuing the security of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual chooses Lottery B because it has no risk of loss ( effectively, a 0% probability of a negative minimum outcome), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

Given these comparisons, the individual’s focus on avoiding loss and choosing the secure option directly aligns with the decision reason’s emphasis on the probability of the minimum outcome. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the individual used a reasoning process consistent with the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery: Lottery A has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 100% probability, and Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros with 50% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of loss in Lottery B, mentioning the 50% chance of losing 6000 Euros, and compares it with the safety of Lottery A, where no loss is possible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by stating that the potential loss in Lottery B is too high and not worth the 50% chance of winning, preferring instead the safety offered by Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the risk of loss (minimum outcome) in Lottery B and the safety (no loss) of Lottery A, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers no risk of loss (minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 100% probability), implying a preference for the lottery with a ""lower probability of the minimum outcome"" since Lottery A can be seen as having a 0% chance of experiencing a negative outcome like Lottery B's -6000 Euros.
Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as both involve preferring the option that minimizes the risk of the worst outcome.
