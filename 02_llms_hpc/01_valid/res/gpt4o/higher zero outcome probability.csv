15,"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery.
    - Lottery A offers 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
    - Lottery B does not offer a zero outcome; it offers -5 Euros with a 100% probability.

16,"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
    - Lottery A: The monetary outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, with no outcome being zero. Therefore, the probability of a zero outcome is 0%.
    - Lottery B: The monetary outcome is 1500 Euros, with no outcome being zero. Therefore, the probability of a zero outcome is 0%.

    In this case, neither lottery has a zero outcome. Therefore, the relevant information (probabilities of zero outcomes for both lotteries) is available for this decision reason.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
    - Lottery A has a 0% probability of a zero outcome.
    - Lottery B has a 0% probability of a zero outcome.
