STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 1% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability, but since it's the only outcome, it's not really a ""minimum"" in the sense of risk, as there's no lower outcome. However, according to the reason's criteria, we focus on the probability of the lowest possible outcome. Thus, Lottery A has a 1% chance of its minimum outcome (0 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% chance of having an outcome less than 2400 Euros, but since 2400 Euros is its minimum and only outcome, it effectively has a 100% chance of its ""minimum"" outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 1% chance of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 2400 Euros, implying 0% chance of any outcome less than 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with each lottery and the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries, specifically mentioning the lack of a significant difference between 2400 and 2500 Euros for them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it was ""risikofreist"" (risk-free), wanting to be on the safe side and definitely achieve a gain. They also mentioned that the difference between 2400 and 2500 Euros was not significant enough to take on risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of risk. However, the individual's focus was more on the absence of risk in Lottery B rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of its minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery B because it was risk-free, implying they prioritized avoiding the risk of the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery A, which aligns with preferring a lower probability of the minimum (or worst) outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning about risk and the desire to avoid it aligns closely with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome, although the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes. The emphasis on risk avoidance and the preference for the ""risk-free"" option suggest that the decision reason was likely influential in the individual's decision-making process, but the report does not provide a direct, explicit match to the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 67%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 66%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 67% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 66% probability
This information indicates that the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem, as it involves comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions that the sums to be won did not have a big difference in their opinion, but they focused on the highest possible probability for a win. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because it had the highest possible probability for a win, which implies they considered the probability of winning (not specifically the probability of the minimum outcome) in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), but the individual's consideration was on the probability of winning (getting a non-zero outcome), which is indirectly related but not the same.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome (which would be Lottery B with 66% probability of 0 Euros), but the individual's justification is based on the highest probability of winning (also leading to the choice of Lottery B, but for a different reason).
Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (both prefer Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's final choice aligns with the decision reason's preference, the reasoning process they described does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a 0% probability of getting less than 3000 Euros, and Lottery B has a 20% probability of getting 0 Euros. This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of a large sum in Lottery A and the risk involved in Lottery B for a potentially higher amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that it wasn't worth taking the risk with Lottery B for a possibly higher amount when a large sum was guaranteed in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk of Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros for B and the guaranteed amount for A).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implies a preference for the guaranteed amount over the risk, which aligns with preferring the lower probability of the minimum outcome (in this case, Lottery A has a 0% chance of getting less than its minimum, which is implicitly considered).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of the guaranteed win in Lottery A and the risk in Lottery B, along with their justification for choosing the guaranteed amount over the risk, closely aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of this minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the relative likelihood of winning a significant sum in each lottery and compared the potential risk and reward, noting that while Lottery B offers a higher potential win, the risk (implied by the lower probability of winning) is not justified by the potential reward.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification hinges on the comparative probabilities of winning a significant sum in each lottery and the perceived value of the risk involved, suggesting that the decision was influenced by the likelihood of winning a substantial amount rather than the absolute value of the potential win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report as a key consideration. Instead, the individual talks about the probability of winning a significant sum.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome (which would be Lottery A, with 75% probability of 0 Euros, compared to Lottery B's 80%). The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the comparative likelihood of winning and the risk involved, not explicitly the probability of the minimum outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses specifically on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification is more about the risk-reward tradeoff related to winning a significant sum, rather than explicitly about avoiding the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly reflect consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a probability of 55%. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery, which is 10% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery A and implies that this high probability is a significant factor in their decision. They also mention the ""50/50 chance"" at Lottery B, which seems to be a misunderstanding or simplification of the actual probabilities (45% for the higher outcome and 55% for the minimum outcome), but indicates they considered the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by stating that the 90% probability is ""almost 100%"" and thus preferred it to minimize risk, implying that the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery A was a key factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is directly related to the individual's concern about risk, as expressed in the verbal report. The individual's consideration of the high probability of winning in Lottery A indirectly reflects a consideration of the low probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's preference for Lottery A due to its lower risk (as inferred from their justification). The individual's decision to choose Lottery A because of its high probability of a positive outcome (and thus low probability of the minimum outcome) aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90
The individual's verbal report indicates a strong alignment with the decision reason's focus on minimizing the probability of the minimum outcome, although the report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between the two lotteries. The individual's emphasis on the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery A and their desire to minimize risk suggests that they were influenced by the same factors that the decision reason considers. However, the assessment is not 100 because the verbal report does not directly state a comparison of the minimum outcome probabilities between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For both lotteries, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. The probability of this outcome is 99.9% for Lottery B and 99.8% for Lottery A. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B has a 99.9% probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
- Lottery A has a 99.8% probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of achieving a win with each lottery, noting that Lottery A had a higher probability of winning than Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher chance of winning to keep the risk low, implying they preferred the option that seemed safer in terms of getting some reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, while the individual considered the probability of achieving a win. Although related, these are not exactly the same focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (99.8% chance of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was because it had a higher chance of winning, which aligns with preferring the lottery that has a relatively lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in the context of the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's reasoning does not directly mention the probability of the minimum outcome as the deciding factor, their choice and justification (preferring the higher chance of winning to keep risk low) indirectly align with the principle of minimizing the probability of the worst outcome (0 Euros). However, the direct language used by the individual does not explicitly match the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with an 80% probability, and for Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 80% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the possibility of not incurring losses with Lottery B (""zumindest noch eine Chance keine Verluste schließlich zu machen"") and weighed this against the potential losses of both lotteries (""ob ich am Ende 3000 oder 4000 Euro Verluste habe, macht keinen allzu großen Unterschied""). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be the presence of a chance to avoid losses and the perceived smaller difference between the two potential losses.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused on the presence of a chance to avoid losses with Lottery B and the relative difference in losses, rather than explicitly discussing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. However, the decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as they chose Lottery B, which has a higher probability of its minimum outcome (-4000 Euros at 80%) compared to Lottery A (-3000 Euros at 100%). The individual's focus was more on the existence of a chance to avoid loss and less on the specific probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which is not directly in line with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the percentages of not making a loss in both lotteries and compared the potential losses, noting that the difference in loss amounts wasn't too significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the perceived risk and potential losses, mentioning that the percentages of not losing looked better in one option, implying a consideration of probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is somewhat aligned with the individual's consideration of ""percentages of not making a loss"" but does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification mentions considering the risk and potential for more losses but does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report indicates some consideration of probabilities and potential losses, which is tangentially related to the decision reason. However, the report does not clearly articulate a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a slight indication of alignment, it's not strong enough to conclude with certainty that the decision reason was used. The assessment leans towards not using the decision reason but acknowledges some vague similarities in consideration."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery A as a direct loss and viewed Lottery B as having a 50/50 chance of not losing 6000 Euros. They found the decision difficult.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to ""setzen auf mein Glück"" (bet on their luck) because the difference between losing 3000 Euros or 6000 Euros did not seem significant, as they felt they would have ""lost"" either way.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B. The individual, however, seems to have misinterpreted the probabilities, mentioning a ""50/50 chance"" for Lottery B, which does not align with the actual probabilities given.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (45% probability of -6000 Euros). The individual's justification, however, is based on perceiving both losses as significant and choosing based on luck rather than a systematic comparison of probabilities or outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a misunderstanding of the probabilities involved and a decision-making process based on perceived loss magnitudes and luck rather than the systematic comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Es sei denn die unaufgedeckten Informationen beweisen mir noch, dass es sich vielleicht doch lohnen würde.''Dies war aber nicht der Fall; Man würde keinen Gewinn erzielen, wenn man auf dieses gefährliche Angebot eingehen würde. Ich habe gehofft, dass Lotterie B ein besseres Angebot aufweist. Als ich gesehen habe, dass es weniger Verlüste geben würde, blieb ich aufmerksam und sah mir die Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür an. Die war praktisch die selbe wie bei Lotterie A - allerdings waren die Verlüste ja geringe und dies habe ich mir gemerkt.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, but Lottery A has a 99.9% probability of this outcome, while Lottery B has a 99.8% probability. 
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery: 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the large amount of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, the low probability of winning, and the potential for no gain. 
They also considered the lower potential loss in Lottery B, the similar probability of winning compared to Lottery A, and the overall potential for fewer losses.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by stating that Lottery B seemed like a better offer because it would result in fewer losses, theoretically, even though the probabilities of winning were similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is implicitly considered by the individual when they mention the ""similar probability"" and the potential for ""fewer losses"" in Lottery B, indicating an awareness of the probabilities associated with the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in both lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's preference for Lottery B because it is perceived as having ""fewer losses"" (implying a lower probability of the minimum outcome or less severe outcomes in case of loss), even though the individual does not explicitly state the comparison of probabilities of the minimum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual seems to have considered aspects aligned with the decision reason, focusing on the implications of the probabilities and outcomes, though not explicitly stating the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability. Since the minimum outcome of Lottery A has a 0% chance of being less than 500 Euros (as it is guaranteed), and Lottery B has a 50% chance of resulting in its minimum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 0% chance of an outcome less than 500 Euros (100% chance of 500 Euros)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of ending up with 0 Euros (50% probability in Lottery B) versus the guarantee of getting 500 Euros (Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that practically getting 500 Euros guaranteed is more worthwhile than taking a risk that could result in 0 Euros, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of the lower outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of the lower outcome (0 Euros in Lottery B), which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery A because it avoids the risk (50% chance) of getting 0 Euros, which is the minimum outcome in Lottery B. This preference for avoiding the higher risk of the minimum outcome aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's consideration of the risk associated with the minimum outcome and their justification for choosing the guaranteed amount over the riskier option directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. This alignment suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50/50 chance of not making losses and seemed to focus on the possibility of avoiding losses rather than the specific amounts of potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on setting their hopes on luck and seeing a good chance of not making losses, with an additional mention that the difference between losing 500 Euros or 1000 Euros does not make a big difference to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, but the individual's consideration is more about the chance of avoiding losses and less about comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes or using such a rule to make the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's focus was more on the chance of avoiding losses and the perceived difference in loss amounts rather than on the specific probabilities of the minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used, but there is a slight possibility due to the mention of probabilities in a general sense."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 75%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower probability (50%) of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, noting the multiple chances to win in Lottery A and the high reward but also high risk of winning nothing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered multiple ""Gewinn-Optionen"" (winning options), hoping to achieve at least one of the possible wins, despite acknowledging the sums were lower than in Lottery B. The individual later realized a mistake in their thought process, recognizing that the probability of winning in Lottery A wasn't greater than in Lottery B, and expressed regret over not choosing Lottery B for a potentially larger win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual did consider probabilities but focused more on the presence of multiple winning options in Lottery A and the potential for a large win in Lottery B, rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, was based on the desire to have multiple chances to win, not explicitly on the probability of the minimum outcome. Although the individual's choice aligned with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the decision reason as described. The focus was more on the multiple winning options and the potential for a large win rather than the probability of the minimum outcome. While the choice made aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, also with a 25% probability, but it's important to note that Lottery A has two negative outcomes (-4000 Euros and -2000 Euros), and the probability of getting any negative outcome is 75% (25% for -4000 Euros + 25% for -2000 Euros + 50% for 0 Euros, where only the 75% that includes -4000 and -2000 and 0 is relevant for the comparison of minimum outcomes, but specifically, the -4000 Euros is the minimum with 25%). However, since the reason focuses on the minimum outcome, we compare the probabilities of the worst outcomes: -6000 Euros for B (25%) and -4000 Euros for A (25%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential for a very large loss in Lottery B and notes that Lottery A can result in less loss than Lottery B, regardless of which probability wins. This indicates the individual is focusing on the potential losses and comparing them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the comparison of potential losses between the two lotteries, particularly highlighting the significant loss potential in Lottery B and the relatively lesser loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which in this case is -6000 Euros for Lottery B and -4000 Euros for Lottery A, both with a 25% probability. The individual considers the potential for significant loss, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes but does not explicitly mention the probabilities of these outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers less potential for loss compared to Lottery B, which indirectly suggests a consideration of the minimum outcomes but does not directly address the probability of these outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report suggests an alignment with the spirit of the decision reason (focusing on the worst outcomes and preferring the one with potentially less severe loss), but it does not explicitly match the decision reason's specific criteria (comparing probabilities of the minimum outcomes). The individual's justification is more about the magnitude of potential loss rather than the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (consideration of worst-case scenarios), it does not directly align with the specific rule of comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, but there are indications that the individual considered aspects related to it."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a probability of 100% (since it's a guaranteed outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 99.9% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B (since the minimum outcome of 5 Euros is guaranteed, the probability of getting less than 5 Euros is 0%). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning with Lottery A and the guaranteed amount of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning with Lottery A was too low, making the guaranteed amount of Lottery B more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the low probability of winning (minimum outcome of 0 Euros) with Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the guarantee of Lottery B rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. Lottery B has a lower probability of its minimum outcome (0% chance of getting less than 5 Euros) compared to Lottery A (99.9% chance of getting 0 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason. The individual's choice of Lottery B because it was ""garantiert"" (guaranteed) suggests an understanding that Lottery B has a more favorable minimum outcome in terms of probability (0% chance of not getting the minimum), even though the individual does not explicitly state the comparison in terms of probabilities of minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning process and justification for choosing Lottery B align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, although the individual's explanation does not perfectly mirror the decision reason's rule. The emphasis on the guarantee of Lottery B implies an understanding of the probability of the minimum outcome, supporting the use of the decision reason. However, the lack of explicit comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes introduces some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a probability of 100%. 
The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a 0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 100% chance of losing 5 Euros.
This information is relevant to applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the small probability of losing a significant amount (5000 Euros) in Lottery A versus the certain loss of a small amount (5 Euros) in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by stating that even a small probability of losing 5000 Euros was not worth the risk when they could lose only 5 Euros, which they would not mind losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probability and impact of the worst outcome in each lottery, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual’s justification suggests they preferred Lottery B because they did not want to risk losing 5000 Euros, even with a low probability, indicating they valued avoiding the higher loss, which is consistent with preferring a lower probability of a significant loss but does not directly state a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's consideration of the probability and impact of the worst outcomes and their justification for choosing Lottery B due to the significant potential loss in Lottery A suggest some alignment with the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the basis for the decision, which is the core of the decision reason. Thus, while there is some indication that the decision reason might have influenced the choice, it is not explicitly stated, leading to a degree of uncertainty."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a probability of 0%, since the outcome is a guaranteed gain. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the risk of making a loss in Lottery B as very unattractive, comparing it to Lottery A which has ""keine Verluste"" (no losses) and ""100%ige Gewinnchancen"" (100% chance of winning). The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the absence of loss in Lottery A and the significant risk of loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability of the minimum outcome) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and guarantee of gain), it appears the individual was influenced by the concept of avoiding the worst outcome, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which in this case is Lottery A because it has no chance of the minimum outcome being a loss. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it has no risk of loss and a guaranteed gain suggests they were applying a similar logic, prioritizing the avoidance of the worst-case scenario presented by Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90"
18,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as described.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 0% probability of getting anything less (since it's a 100% chance of getting 2000 Euros). Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of its minimum outcome (-3000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 0% probability of any outcome less than 2000 Euros, implying it has the lowest possible probability of a minimum outcome since its outcome is fixed at 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery A and the certainty of a positive outcome in Lottery B. They weighed the potential for a large gain against the risk of a large loss in Lottery A and compared it to the guaranteed gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offered a certain gain without any risk of loss, which they found more appealing than the risky option of Lottery A, despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the probability of the minimum outcome (a large loss) in Lottery A and the certainty of a gain in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B since it has a 0% chance of any outcome less than 2000 Euros. The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a certain gain without risk, which indirectly reflects a preference for the lower probability of a minimum (or negative) outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision process and the decision reason share a common consideration regarding the avoidance of risk (or the probability of the minimum outcome), even though the verbal report does not explicitly state the decision reason's rule. The individual's emphasis on avoiding a significant loss and opting for a certain gain suggests an alignment with the principle of minimizing the probability of the worst outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, as the individual's deliberation process and final justification for choosing Lottery B align with the principle of preferring the option with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. However, it is not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes as the primary decision criterion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a 0% probability of an outcome worse than 1000 Euros, and Lottery B has a 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because it guaranteed a win, whereas Lottery B had a significant chance of a substantial loss, making the risk not worth the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss in Lottery B and the guarantee of a win in Lottery A, which aligns with focusing on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implies a preference for avoiding the risk of a significant loss (which is the minimum outcome in Lottery B), which aligns with preferring the lottery (A) that has a lower probability (in this case, 0%) of its minimum outcome (which is not a loss but a guaranteed gain).

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome and the preference for the lottery that minimizes the risk of the worst outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90 
This assessment is high because the individual's verbal report closely aligns with the logic of preferring the lottery based on the probability of its minimum outcome, but it's not a perfect match since the report emphasizes the guarantee of a win and the risk of loss rather than explicitly stating a comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. However, the essence of the decision reason is reflected in the individual's justification, indicating a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. However, since 0 Euros is not a loss, we can consider it as the minimum outcome with no negative implication, thus making it inherently preferable under this reason due to its certainty and lack of downside risk. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the worst outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows: Lottery B has a 50% chance of losing 6000 Euros, and Lottery A has a 0% chance of losing any amount (since its outcome is 0 Euros with certainty).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""50% chance of making a big loss,"" which indicates they considered the risk of the negative outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that a 50% chance of a big loss ""is simply not worth it"" for them, indicating they are averse to the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the risk (50% chance) of the significant loss, aligning with the aspect of focusing on the downside risk, although they did not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification is based on risk aversion to the significant loss in Lottery B, which indirectly suggests preferring the lottery (A) with no risk of loss, thus aligning with the principle of avoiding the higher probability of a negative outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the individual's decision was influenced by considerations similar to those outlined in the decision reason, given their focus on the risk of a significant loss and the implicit preference for the safer option. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between the two lotteries in their verbal report."
