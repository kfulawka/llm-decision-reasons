STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is always probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 2500 Euros with 33% probability and 2400 Euros with 66% probability, since both probabilities are higher than 33.33%.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (2500*0.33 + 2400*0.66) = (825 + 1584) = 2409 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""verschwindend geringe Abweichung bei der Summe"" which translates to a ""vanishingly small difference in the sum,"" indicating they considered the difference in the total or expected value between the two options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual concludes ""Sicher ist sicher"" which translates to ""Safe is safe,"" suggesting they prioritized certainty over potential higher rewards.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the average of probable outcomes, which requires considering the probabilities and outcomes of each lottery. The individual seems to have considered the difference in sums but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes or directly comparing the probabilities of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual, however, prioritized certainty (""Sicher ist sicher""), which aligns more with risk aversion rather than directly comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process focused more on the certainty of the outcome rather than explicitly calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason suggests.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects related to the value of the lotteries, their justification and decision-making process as described do not closely align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, indicating it's unlikely they used this decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. However, given that the only probable outcome for both is 0 Euros, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. But to apply the reason, we must consider if the individual could have applied a different interpretation or calculation based on the given probabilities and outcomes, especially focusing on the concept of ""probable"" as defined.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the 100€ difference was not significant to them, so they looked at the probabilities, noticing they were almost the same, and then chose the higher one. This implies the individual considered the monetary difference between the two lotteries and the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the comparison of the probabilities and the monetary values of the lotteries, specifically choosing the higher value since the probabilities were perceived as almost equal.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes and their average. The individual, however, seems to have considered the overall probabilities and the monetary difference, not explicitly mentioning the concept of ""probable outcomes"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Given that both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would not differentiate between them based on the provided definition. However, the individual chose based on the higher monetary value when probabilities were deemed similar, not explicitly following the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their average. The individual's justification is based on a comparison of probabilities and monetary values without explicitly considering the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (3000 Euros with 100% probability), so any probability above 1/1 = 1 or 100% makes an outcome probable. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so probabilities above 1/2 = 0.5 or 50% make an outcome probable. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros is probable because its probability (100%) is higher than the threshold (100%).
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 4000 Euros is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than the threshold (50%), but the outcome of 0 Euros is not probable because its probability (20%) is below the threshold.
Thus, the probable outcomes are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings between the two lotteries and the risk associated with Lottery B. They also mentioned that 3000 Euros are guaranteed, implying they valued the certainty of this outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the potential for a higher payout with Lottery B, the risk was too high, and the guaranteed 3000 Euros from Lottery A were sufficiently valuable to them, especially considering their personal financial situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual considered the difference in winnings and the risk, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but does not directly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (4000 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing the guarantee and lower risk as more important than the potential higher payout, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B, based on the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus on risk and the guarantee of 3000 Euros suggests they used a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. However, since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes and both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), we need to consider how the individual's reasoning might align with this in the context of the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are similar (""(Zu) ähnliche Wahrscheinlichkeit""), so they focus on the sum (""Fokus auf die Summe""), indicating they consider the monetary outcomes. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states ""Höher ist in dem Fall besser"" (Higher is better in this case), which implies they prefer the lottery with the higher monetary outcome, given the similar probabilities. They choose Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a probable outcome of 0 Euros. However, the individual focuses on the similarity in probabilities and then on the monetary outcomes, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the decision reason does not provide a clear preference based on its defined rule. The individual, however, prefers the higher monetary outcome when probabilities are similar, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes. 

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, especially since the decision reason's criteria (average of probable outcomes) do not differentiate between the lotteries and the individual's choice is based on a different criterion (higher monetary outcome when probabilities are similar).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable. The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome.
Thus, the probable outcomes are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability (90%) of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A as ""quasi garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) and views the 45% probability of winning in Lottery B as ""quasi 50/50"" (almost 50/50), which they are not willing to risk for the potential of doubling the gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the almost guaranteed gain of 3000 Euros over the riskier option of potentially doubling the gain but with a lower perceived guarantee.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The individual considers the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, aligning with the concept of focusing on probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which is Lottery A. The individual prefers Lottery A due to its high probability of gain, which can be interpreted as preferring the lottery with the more favorable probable outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the high probability of winning in Lottery A and their preference for this ""almost guaranteed"" gain over the riskier Lottery B aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on probable outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's justification is more intuitive and risk-averse, focusing on the guarantee of the gain rather than explicitly calculating averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, while there is a strong alignment, the assessment is not a perfect match due to the lack of explicit calculation or mention of the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Here, only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 0.5.
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. Similarly, only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. For both lotteries, the average of the probable outcomes is 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable for each.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability difference between the two lotteries and the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B, noting that the sums are close enough to be considered high and that they are not disadvantaged in either situation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds Lottery B more attractive due to the possibility of a higher gain despite the low probability, and they decide to ""setze aufs Glück"" (bet on luck) since they don't urgently need the money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the difference in potential gains and the attractiveness of a higher possible win, not explicitly on the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, is not indifferent and chooses based on the potential for a higher gain, not the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the average of probable outcomes, which does not influence the individual's choice as described. Instead, the individual is swayed by the potential for a higher gain and the concept of ""betting on luck,"" indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's break down the task into the specified steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there's only one outcome (-3000 Euros with 100% probability), so the threshold for a probable outcome is 1/1 = 1 (or 100%). For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so the threshold is 1/2 = 0.5 (or 50%). Thus, for Lottery A, -3000 Euros is a probable outcome since its probability is 100%, exceeding the threshold. For Lottery B, -4000 Euros with 80% probability is a probable outcome because it exceeds the 50% threshold, but 0 Euros with 20% does not. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, it's -4000 Euros (since only the -4000 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold). Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because -3000 Euros is higher than -4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the potential loss of 1000 Euros more in Lottery B compared to Lottery A, indicating they considered the monetary outcomes. They also mention the certainty of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the chance of a better outcome in Lottery B, showing they considered the probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems torn between the certainty of a -3000 Euro loss and the potential for a better outcome with Lottery B, despite the risk of a larger loss. They seem to be weighing the potential pain of the loss against the hope for a better outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which requires identifying outcomes with probabilities above a certain threshold and calculating their average. The individual discusses the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes based on the threshold defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification revolves around the trade-off between the certainty of loss and the chance for a better outcome, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of averages of probable outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual considers aspects relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities), there's no clear indication they applied the specific rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus seems more on the risk vs. certainty trade-off rather than the specific calculation implied by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as defined, given the lack of explicit mention or application of the specific rule regarding the average of probable outcomes in their deliberation process."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome ""-4000 Euros"" has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome ""0 Euros"" has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is ""0 Euros"".
For Lottery B, the outcome ""-3000 Euros"" has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome ""0 Euros"" has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is ""0 Euros"".
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is ""0 Euros"" since only the ""0 Euros"" outcome is probable for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual perceived the probabilities as quasi-equal and focused on the sum, noticing that Lottery B has a 25% lesser loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a lesser loss (25% less) compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be ""0 Euros"" for both lotteries. However, the individual focused on the difference in potential losses and perceived the probabilities as quasi-equal, not explicitly considering the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have ""0 Euros"" as their probable outcome, the decision reason would not differentiate between them based on the provided definition. However, the individual's justification is based on the difference in potential losses, not on comparing averages of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is -3000 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A but noted that the 55% chance of 0 Euros (no loss) was attractive enough to consider this option over the ""almost certain"" loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the potential high loss of Lottery A to the guaranteed loss of Lottery B, focusing on the attractiveness of the no-loss outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, seemed to focus more on the potential for no loss in Lottery A and the guaranteed loss in Lottery B, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A (0 Euros) over Lottery B (-3000 Euros). The individual's justification, while not explicitly following this rule, does seem to lean towards preferring the option that offers a chance of no loss over a guaranteed loss, which aligns with the general direction of the decision reason but does not directly apply the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision might align with the outcome suggested by the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its probable outcome being more favorable), the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual applied the specific rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus was more on the attractiveness of avoiding a guaranteed loss rather than on calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is also 0 Euros. 
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. 
However, the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes cannot be directly applied here because both averages are the same. But we can still analyze how the individual's thought process aligns with considering probable outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Schmerzaversion"" (loss aversion), indicating a preference for avoiding losses over acquiring gains, and compares the worst-case scenarios of both lotteries, focusing on the magnitude of the loss rather than the probability. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by comparing the worst-case losses, stating a preference for losing 3000 Euros over 6000 Euros, implying that the focus is on the magnitude of potential losses due to loss aversion.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages, but the individual's consideration is more aligned with loss aversion and the comparison of worst-case scenarios rather than the calculation of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on avoiding larger losses, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially since the probable outcomes (0 Euros for both) do not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the decision reason's criteria. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on loss aversion and the magnitude of potential losses.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are at the threshold of being considered probable.
- Lottery A has one outcome: 500 Euros with 100% probability, which is clearly probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the concept of a ""sicherer Gewinn"" (safe gain), implying consideration of the risk and the certainty of the outcomes. They compare the potential gain from Lottery B to the guaranteed amount from Lottery A, indicating an awareness of the trade-off between risk and reward.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the ""sicherer Gewinn"" is preferred over the risk of potentially higher gain, especially since the difference is not significant enough to warrant taking the risk. They also mention a hypothetical scenario where a higher potential gain (2000 Euros) might have led to more consideration.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages. The individual considers the certainty of gain and the risk associated with each lottery, which aligns with evaluating outcomes based on their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual prefers the safe gain because the potential higher reward does not justify the risk, which suggests a consideration of the outcomes but not necessarily a calculation of averages based on probabilities greater than 1/2.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the certainty of gain and risk assessment somewhat aligns with considering probable outcomes, but there is no clear indication that they calculated or compared the averages of probable outcomes as per the decision reason. The justification provided is more about risk preference than about comparing averages of probable outcomes. Thus, while there is some alignment in considering the probabilistic nature of the outcomes, the specific application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there's only 1 outcome, so its probability is 100%, making it probable by default. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable since their probabilities are exactly 50%, which meets the criteria for being probable in a two-outcome scenario.
- Lottery A has one outcome: -500 Euros with 100% probability, making it probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery A, it's -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to be considering the probabilities and the potential losses or gains, mentioning the probability of getting something versus losing. However, the specific mention of ""2000€"" and ""1000€ geschenkt zu bekommen"" (getting 1000€ as a gift) doesn't directly align with the lotteries' descriptions provided, suggesting a potential misunderstanding or miscommunication in the report regarding the actual lotteries in question. The individual seems to focus on the concept of risk and potential gain but doesn't clearly articulate the probabilities or the specific outcomes of the lotteries as defined.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to hinge on the perceived value of potential gains versus losses and the associated probabilities, but it's not clearly aligned with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration of probabilities and outcomes doesn't directly match the specific criteria (average of probable outcomes) outlined in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but the individual's justification doesn't clearly reflect this rule, instead focusing on a more general comparison of potential gains and losses without specifying how probabilities influence the choice beyond a vague acknowledgment of their importance.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual considered the average of probable outcomes as the basis for their decision, nor does it align well with the specific probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries as described. The justification provided in the report does not reflect the decision reason's rule, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%.

For Lottery A:
- 6000 Euros with 25% probability is not probable.
- 0 Euros with 75% probability is probable.

For Lottery B:
- 4000 Euros with 25% probability is not probable.
- 2000 Euros with 25% probability is not probable.
- 0 Euros with 50% probability is probable.

The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considers the significant difference between getting some money with a certain probability versus getting nothing with a higher probability. They mention deciding based on the higher probability rather than the higher gain, which suggests they are focusing on the likelihood of not getting nothing (or getting something) as a primary factor.

The individual’s justification seems to revolve around the comparison of probabilities of getting money versus not getting money, rather than explicitly calculating or considering the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the average of probable outcomes) with that considered by the individual (the probability of getting money vs. not getting money), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both involve considering probabilities, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.

The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) does not directly align with the individual’s justification (focusing on the probability of getting some money vs. the probability of getting nothing). The individual's reasoning is more about the risk of getting nothing rather than comparing averages of outcomes that meet a certain probability threshold.

Given this analysis, the individual's decision process as described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason as defined.

The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros (with 50% probability) since it exceeds the 33.33% threshold.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros (with 75% probability) since it exceeds the 50% threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is also (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the frequency of losses and the magnitude of loss in both lotteries, comparing the worst-case scenarios of both lotteries which have the same probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, although they might lose more often, the amount lost is significantly less than in Lottery B, highlighting the difference the €2000 loss makes compared to the €6000 loss in the worst-case scenarios.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have 0 Euros as their probable outcome average. However, the individual considered the magnitude of losses and the frequency of losing, not directly the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of worst-case scenarios and the frequency of losses, not directly on the average of probable outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual is not indifferent and prefers Lottery A based on different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual considered factors such as the magnitude of potential losses and the frequency of losing, rather than the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. Given this, for Lottery A, only the 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability is considered probable because it exceeds the 0.5 threshold. For Lottery B, the 5 Euros outcome with 100% probability is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the potential impact of the monetary outcomes on their life, mentioning that 5 Euros would not change their life but 5000 Euros would, and not getting the 5000 Euros would not make their life worse. Second, the individual's justification for their choice seems to be based on the significant potential gain from Lottery A and the minimal impact of not winning, leading them to ""try their luck.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (potential life impact and the decision to try their luck), it appears the individual did not directly consider the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on the potential life-changing impact of the larger prize and the minimal downside). The individual's decision to ""try their luck"" suggests a focus on the potential upside rather than a systematic comparison of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always probable since 1/1 = 1. 
- Lottery A has one probable outcome: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, since 99.9% > 0.5. The -5000 Euros outcome is not probable because 0.1% < 0.5.
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: -5 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery A, specifically the 99.9% chance of not losing anything and the severe negative impact of losing 5000 Euros in their current life situation. They also considered the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery B as a form of security against losing 5000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the value of security (not losing 5000 Euros) being worth more than the potential loss of 5 Euros, indicating a risk-averse stance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is -5 Euros. The individual considered the risk and the severe impact of the large loss, but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A (0 Euros) over Lottery B (-5 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery B, indicating their decision was based on avoiding a significant loss rather than directly comparing the averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus was on risk aversion and the value of security against a significant loss, rather than on comparing the averages of probable outcomes. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, so it is considered probable by default (since 100% is greater than 1/1). The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery B, both +3000 Euros and -3000 Euros are probable; for Lottery A, 1500 Euros is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the guarantee of a win, the risk associated with a 50% chance of loss, and compares the difference in potential winnings. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A, the risk of loss in Lottery B, and the potential gain difference between the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that a guaranteed win is almost always better than a possible high win, especially when there's also a possible loss. They find the 50% risk too high and the difference in potential winnings not significant enough to take on the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. While the individual discusses risk and guaranteed outcomes, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes based on the given probabilities. However, their discussion about risk and guaranteed wins implies an understanding of the probabilities and outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery A (1500 Euros) over Lottery B (0 Euros average). The individual's justification emphasizes the preference for a guaranteed win over a risky option with potential for higher gain but also loss, aligning with preferring Lottery A but not explicitly due to the calculation of average probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's justification aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery A over Lottery B), the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the step-by-step calculation and comparison of average probable outcomes as outlined in the decision reason. However, the emphasis on guaranteed wins and risk avoidance suggests an intuitive understanding that aligns with the decision reason's preference, leading to a score above the midpoint but not indicating certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B (3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability) meet this criterion because their probabilities are exactly 50%, which is not higher than 50% but in this context, it seems reasonable to consider both since they are equal to the threshold. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (2000 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money with Lottery B, the difference in potential winnings between Lotteries A and B, and the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery A. They also considered the potential loss of 3000 Euros from Lottery B and how it compares to the gain from Lottery A in terms of perceived value or pain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk of losing money with Lottery B was too high compared to the potential gain, and the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery A was more appealing. They also mentioned that losing 3000 Euros would cause significant pain, implying that the potential loss outweighed the potential gain in terms of emotional or psychological impact.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual considered the risk (which can be related to the concept of probable outcomes) and the difference in potential winnings but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of gain from Lottery A, rather than explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's decision process involved evaluating risks and outcomes, it does not directly align with the specific rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus on risk, certainty, and the perceived value of gains and losses suggests a more nuanced decision-making process that may not strictly adhere to the given decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are some elements in the individual's decision process that could be tangentially related to the decision reason (such as considering outcomes and their probabilities), the explicit rule of the decision reason (comparing averages of probable outcomes) does not directly match the individual's justification or the information they considered. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A (3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability) meet this criterion because their probabilities are exactly 0.5, which is not higher but equal to the threshold. However, for the purpose of calculating the average of probable outcomes, we consider both since they are at the threshold and there's no outcome with a probability higher than 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome (1000 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average for each lottery. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed nature of the 1000 Euros from Lottery B and the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they weighed the certainty of a gain against the potential for a significant loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by emphasizing the importance of the guaranteed 1000 Euros and the potential loss in Lottery A being too significant, suggesting a risk-averse stance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would lead to a comparison between 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, while not explicitly calculating averages, considered the guaranteed gain of Lottery B and the significant potential loss of Lottery A, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not directly mention calculating averages or comparing them based on probability thresholds.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to the preference of Lottery B, but based on the guaranteed nature of the reward and the aversion to the potential significant loss, rather than explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion and the value of a guaranteed gain, rather than a calculation of probable outcomes. Therefore, it's somewhat uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there's a leaning towards its possible influence due to the alignment in the final preference."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, making both outcomes probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, which is 0 Euros with 100% probability, making it probable. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 6000 Euros from Lottery B and found it too significant to be outweighed by the potential gain of 6000 Euros. They also considered their current financial situation to be satisfactory enough to be content with 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential loss against the potential gain and considering their personal financial satisfaction with the outcome of 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is 0 Euros. The individual, however, focused on the potential loss and gain, and their personal satisfaction with 0 Euros, not explicitly calculating or mentioning averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the significance of potential loss and personal financial satisfaction, not explicitly on the basis of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification and considerations do not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report indicates the individual made their decision based on different criteria (potential loss and personal financial satisfaction) than the decision reason (average of probable outcomes), suggesting the decision reason was not used."
