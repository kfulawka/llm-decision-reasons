3,"with the more favorable least probable outcome.assistantLet's analyze the decision problem using the given decision reason step-by-step.

### Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied

The decision reason focuses on the least probable outcomes of each lottery. Specifically, it considers the most favorable outcome with the lowest probability for each lottery. 

- For Lottery A:
  - Outcomes: 4000 Euros (20% probability) and 0 Euros (80% probability)
  - The most favorable outcome is 4000 Euros, which has a probability of 20%.

- For Lottery B:
  - Outcomes: 3000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability)
  - The most favorable outcome is 3000 Euros, which has a probability of 25%.

The relevant information for the decision reason is derived from the probabilities of the most favorable outcomes for each lottery. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

### Step 2: Apply the decision reason

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome. Here, the ""least probable"" refers to the most favorable outcome with the lowest probability.

- Lottery A's most favorable outcome (4000 Euros) has a probability of 20%.
- Lottery B's most favorable outcome (3000 Euros) has a probability of 25%.

According to the decision reason, we compare the probabilities of the most favorable outcomes:

- Lottery A's most favorable outcome (4000 Euros) is more favorable than Lottery B's most favorable outcome (3000 Euros) because 4000 Euros is greater than 3000 Euros.
- The probability of Lottery A's most favorable outcome (4000 Euros) is 20%, which is lower than the probability of Lottery B's most favorable outcome (3000 Euros) at 25%.

Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome, and Lottery A's most favorable outcome (4000 Euros) is both more favorable and has a lower probability (20%) compared to Lottery B's most favorable outcome (3000 Euros at 25%), Lottery A is preferred.

**STEPS:**
1. Identified the most favorable outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries.
2. Compared the most favorable outcomes: 4000 Euros (20%) for Lottery A vs. 3000 Euros (25%) for Lottery B.
3. Determined that Lottery A's most favorable outcome is more favorable and has a lower probability than Lottery B's.

**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.**

The decision reason focuses on the least probable outcomes, specifically the most favorable outcome with the lowest probability in each lottery. We need to identify these outcomes for both Lotteries A and B.

- **Lottery A:**
  - Outcomes: -4000 Euros (80% probability) and 0 Euros (20% probability).
  - The least probable outcome is 0 Euros, which occurs with a probability of 20%.

- **Lottery B:**
  - Outcome: -3000 Euros (100% probability).
  - Since there is only one outcome, it is both the least and most probable outcome, with a probability of 100%.

Since the relevant information (least probable outcomes and their probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome. We compare the least probable outcomes of both lotteries:

- **Lottery A:** The least probable outcome is 0 Euros.
- **Lottery B:** The only outcome is -3000 Euros.

The most favorable outcome is the one with the highest monetary value. Comparing 0 Euros (Lottery A) and -3000 Euros (Lottery B), 0 Euros is more favorable.

- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 80% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 75% probability

The relevant information here is the probability of the most favorable outcome (0 Euros) in each lottery. Since both lotteries have the same most favorable outcome (0 Euros), we can apply the decision reason by comparing the probabilities.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome. In this context, the least probable outcome is the one with the lowest probability, but since both are favorable outcomes (0 Euros), we compare their probabilities:

- Lottery A: Probability of 0 Euros is 80%
- Lottery B: Probability of 0 Euros is 75%

According to the decision reason, we prefer the lottery where the most favorable outcome (0 Euros) has a higher probability. Therefore, Lottery A is preferred because the probability of winning 0 Euros is higher (80%) compared to Lottery B (75%).

The decision reason focuses on the least probable outcomes of each lottery. However, it is important to note that:

- Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes have the same probability.
- Lottery B has one outcome: 1500 Euros with 100% probability.

The decision reason specifies that we should consider the most favorable outcome with the lowest (minimum) probability. In Lottery A, both outcomes have the same probability (50%), so we consider the more favorable of the two, which is 3000 Euros. In Lottery B, there is only one outcome with 100% probability, which is 1500 Euros.

Since we can identify the least probable outcomes for both lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

**Relevant Information:**

- Lottery A: Most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 3000 Euros (50% probability).
- Lottery B: Most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 1500 Euros (100% probability).

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome. Comparing the outcomes:

- Lottery A's most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 3000 Euros.
- Lottery B's most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 1500 Euros.

- **Lottery A:** 
  - Outcomes and Probabilities: 
    - 3000 Euros with 50% probability
    - -3000 Euros with 50% probability

- **Lottery B:** 
  - Outcomes and Probabilities: 
    - 2000 Euros with 100% probability

The decision reason focuses on the ""least probable outcomes,"" meaning the outcomes with the lowest probability. It then evaluates the most favorable of these least probable outcomes. 

- In **Lottery A**, both outcomes (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros) have the same probability of 50%. Therefore, there is no single least probable outcome since both outcomes share the same probability.

- In **Lottery B**, there is only one outcome, 2000 Euros, with a probability of 100%. Hence, there is no least probable outcome since there is only one outcome.

Since both lotteries do not have a distinct least probable outcome (Lottery A has two equally probable outcomes, and Lottery B has only one outcome), the decision reason cannot be applied in a strict manner.

  - -6000 Euros with a probability of 50%

- **Lottery B** has one outcome:
  - 0 Euros with a probability of 100%

The decision reason focuses on the ""least probable outcomes,"" which are interpreted as the most favorable outcome with the lowest (minimum) probability for each lottery. 

For Lottery A, both outcomes have the same probability of 50%. Therefore, we need to consider both outcomes, but since they are equally probable, we can identify the most favorable one:
- The most favorable outcome for Lottery A is 6000 Euros.

For Lottery B, there is only one outcome (0 Euros) with a probability of 100%. Thus, this is both the least probable and the most favorable outcome for Lottery B.

Since we can identify the least probable outcomes for both lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

### Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

- **Lottery A**: The most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 6000 Euros.
- **Lottery B**: The most favorable outcome with the lowest probability is 0 Euros.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable least probable outcome. Comparing the outcomes:
- 6000 Euros (Lottery A) is more favorable than 0 Euros (Lottery B).

Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
