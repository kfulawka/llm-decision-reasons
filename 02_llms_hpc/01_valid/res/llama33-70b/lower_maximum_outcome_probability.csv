To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to identify the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery.

1. **Identify the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery:**
   - For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, which occurs with a 33% probability.
   - For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros, which occurs with a 100% probability.

2. **Apply the decision reason:**
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome.
   - Lottery A has a 33% probability of its maximum outcome (2500 Euros), while Lottery B has a 100% probability of its maximum outcome (2400 Euros).
   - Since 33% is less than 100%, according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred over Lottery B.

1,"STEPS: 
To solve this decision problem, we first assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, so we need to identify the maximum outcomes and their probabilities for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 34%.

Since we can derive the necessary information (the probabilities of the maximum outcomes) from the given lotteries, we can proceed to apply the decision reason.

Next, we apply the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
- The probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery A is 33%.
- The probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery B is 34%.

Since 33% is less than 34%, according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred over Lottery B because it has the lower probability of its maximum outcome.
