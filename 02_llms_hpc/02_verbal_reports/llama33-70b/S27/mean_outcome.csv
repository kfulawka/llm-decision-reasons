STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is 2400 / 1 = 2400 Euros. Since the mean of Lottery A (1633.33 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (2400 Euros) is actually not true, the mean of Lottery B is higher, we can proceed to assess the verbal report to see if the individual applied this reasoning.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual initially looked at the information of Lottery B and then compared the values of A and B, noting a high probability of winning an amount that could be 100 Euros more than B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to be based on the comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities, focusing on the possibility of winning more than in Lottery B with a high probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires calculating the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, but the individual's focus was on the comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities, not explicitly on calculating means.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. Instead, the individual considered the potential for winning more with a high probability.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The individual's focus was more on the potential winnings and their associated probabilities rather than on calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sums of the outcomes and the probabilities of receiving money from each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a slightly higher probability of receiving money over a slightly higher amount, indicating a focus on the likelihood of gaining any amount rather than the magnitude of the gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the difference in sums and the probabilities, not the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on preferring a higher probability of receiving any money, not directly on the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the probability of receiving money and a comparison of the sums, rather than a calculation or consideration of the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. This suggests that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery based on the mean of all outcomes, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2000 Euros), according to the decision reason, Lottery B should be preferred. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A (80%) and compared it to a threshold (around 70%), below which they would have chosen the safer option, Lottery B. They also mentioned not having a loss in Lottery A as a factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability (80%) of winning made it favorable, and they wouldn't have a loss with this option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probability of winning and the absence of potential loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the high probability of winning and no potential loss, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, which suggests calculating and comparing mean outcomes to make a choice.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probability of receiving money and the possibility of receiving a small amount of money, which they perceived as high. They also considered the value of receiving any amount of money over the final sum they would receive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of receiving money and the value they place on receiving any amount of money, rather than the amount of money itself.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and the value of receiving money, not the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on the probability of receiving money and its value, not the mean outcome.
Based on these two comparisons, it seems that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification and considered information do not align with the decision reason's rule and relevant information.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference between the two sums (outcomes) and the risk of losing money. They also mentioned the relatively low probability of receiving the higher sum but highlighted the importance of not having the risk of losing money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the potential for a higher outcome (though not explicitly stated which lottery this refers to), considering the difference in outcomes and the absence of risk in one of the options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the difference in outcomes and the risk associated with each option, not the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B with a mean of 3000 Euros. The individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as they emphasized the difference in outcomes and the absence of risk, rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries or used this as a basis for their decision. Their justification focuses on the difference in outcomes and risk, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions their belief in not receiving money in this scenario and the difficulty of the decision due to the low probability of a positive outcome. They seem to focus on the low probability of winning and the feeling that the decision is somewhat irrelevant due to these low probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the option that gives them a slight chance of winning, despite acknowledging the improbability of the positive outcome. The justification seems to be based on the desire to have any chance of winning, rather than a detailed calculation or comparison of the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the low probabilities and the desire for any chance of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing mean outcomes or preferring one lottery over the other based on this criterion. The individual's decision seems more driven by the desire to have a chance at winning, regardless of the specifics of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries or used this criterion to make their decision. The focus on probabilities and the desire for any chance of winning, rather than a comparison of mean outcomes, suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A would be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the comparison of the values (outcomes) of the two lotteries and the probability of the less favorable outcome in Lottery A. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by considering the risk of losing an additional 1000 Euros with only a 20% chance of avoiding the loss in Lottery A compared to the certain loss in Lottery B. The individual implies that the potential difference in losses between the two lotteries and the probability of avoiding the higher loss influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve considering probabilities or the specific differences in outcomes between lotteries. In contrast, the individual considered the probability of avoiding a loss and the difference in potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not mention calculating mean outcomes or directly comparing them; instead, it focuses on the perceived risk and potential loss differences, suggesting a different decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on the consideration of probabilities and the difference in potential losses, rather than on calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A should be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their mean values.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities (referred to as ""Warscheinlichkeitr"") of the lotteries and the potential losses, noting that small differences in probabilities can lead to significant differences in potential loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B despite the possibility of losing 1000 Euros more, indicating that the difference in probabilities (mentioned as a 5% difference, if remembered correctly) outweighed the potential additional loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities or the specific potential losses as described in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on probabilities and potential losses rather than the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, whereas the individual chose Lottery B based on the difference in probabilities and potential losses, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B since -1500 is greater than -3000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both options, the perceived value of the amounts to be lost (3000 Euros and 6000 Euros), and the difference in these amounts. They also mention that their decision would change with a difference of 1000 Euros more.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the perceived risk and value of the potential losses, rather than a straightforward calculation of mean outcomes. They mention the high probability of losing money in Option B as a deterrent and compare the amounts to be lost, indicating a concern for the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations are more aligned with the perceived risk and value of losses rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not directly align with the individual's justification, which focuses on the perceived risk and magnitude of potential losses rather than a mean outcome calculation.
Based on these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason (calculating and comparing mean outcomes) to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities (mentioning ""0.1 P"" and ""99,x Prozent"") and the outcomes (focusing on the ""Werte"" and the high probability of getting 0 Euros). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by focusing on the high probability of getting 0 Euros in both options, essentially disregarding the potential losses due to their low probabilities, and then decided based on the mindset of not having to experience the loss anyway, opting for the ""geringeren Verlust"" (lesser loss), which implies considering the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes but with a focus on the probability of getting 0 Euros and the mindset of avoiding loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the lesser loss and the high probability of not experiencing a loss), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the perception of risk and the mindset of avoiding loss rather than calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since the mean outcomes are equal, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of each lottery and their number, which can be derived from the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the comparison of the two options in terms of risk and the amount of money, as well as the influence of previous decisions. The individual mentions the risk associated with the option of potentially gaining more (Lottery A) versus the certainty of gaining 500 Euros (Lottery B).
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on the perceived risk of losing the potential gain of 500 Euros for the possibility of gaining only an additional 500 Euros, indicating a risk-averse attitude. The individual prioritizes the certainty of gaining 500 Euros over the riskier option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk, certainty, and previous decisions), it appears the individual focused more on the risk aspect and certainty of the outcomes rather than calculating a mean outcome for each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference based on mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (risk aversion and certainty), it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason’s rule. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chose based on risk considerations, not the calculated mean.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus on risk and certainty, rather than mean outcomes, indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (-500), according to this reason, the individual should be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probability of not losing money (1/2 for Lottery A), the difference in potential losses, and the relative impact of losing 500 Euros versus 1000 Euros. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on the realistic chance of not losing money with Lottery A, the comparison of potential losses, and the psychological impact of these losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, differences in losses, psychological impact), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference based on mean outcomes) to the individual’s justification (focus on probabilities, loss differences, and psychological impact), it seems that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as there is no mention of calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning any amount of money and the potential outcomes (gains or losses). They compared the likelihood of winning at least some amount between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because the probability of winning any amount of money was 25% higher than in Lottery A, and they valued having any gain over having no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and the value of winning any amount, not the mean of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the probability of winning any amount and the preference for any gain over no gain.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses of each lottery and their respective probabilities, focusing on the comparison of losing more money (4000E or 2000E in Lottery B) versus having a high probability of not losing any money in Lottery A (75% chance of 0 Euros).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the probability of losing more money against the amounts to be lost, indicating a consideration of both the probabilities and the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean of the outcomes, which does not directly involve considering probabilities. However, the individual considered both outcomes and their probabilities, not just the mean outcome values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, disregarding probabilities. The individual, however, considered the interplay between probabilities and outcomes, not merely comparing mean outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process involved a more nuanced consideration of both outcomes and probabilities, rather than solely focusing on the mean outcome as the decision reason prescribes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A and compared it to the guaranteed win in Lottery B. They focused on the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning in Lottery A was too low, making a small guaranteed win more valuable than a potential high win with low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focused on the probabilities and the guaranteed win in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual chose Lottery B based on the probability of winning and the value of a guaranteed win. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not match the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The focus on probabilities and the value of a guaranteed win suggests that the individual did not use the specified decision reason to make their choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (-5 Euros > -2500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered their initial gut feeling, the low probability of the 5000 Euros loss in Lottery B, and the fact that they might have chosen differently in another situation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery B, which they almost disregard, but also mentions a contradictory inclination towards choosing Lottery A in a different situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived low risk of the significant loss in Lottery B, rather than a comparison of mean outcomes. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not align with the individual's stated justification.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money in Lottery A and was not willing to take this risk. They prioritized receiving a sum of money over the specific amount, as long as the difference between the two sums is not immensely different.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to avoid the risk of losing money and prioritized receiving a guaranteed sum.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on avoiding risk and receiving a guaranteed sum.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B, but their justification was based on risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed sum, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed sum, rather than the calculation of mean outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2000) / 1 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a significant loss to gain an additional 1000 Euros and weighed this risk against the certain gain of Lottery A. They thought about the difference between the potential gains of Lotteries A and B and how it would need to be much greater to justify taking the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the risk of a significant loss and the difference in potential gains between the two lotteries, deciding the difference was not enough to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss, difference in gains): The individual's considerations do not directly involve calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries as specified by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on risk and difference in gains): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply calculating mean outcomes or directly comparing them as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries to make a choice. The focus on risk and the difference in potential gains does not reflect the calculation or consideration of mean outcomes independent of their probabilities as specified by the decision reason."
19,"and dividing by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.

Verbal report:
Ich habe nach dem Vergleich der beiden Werte die Geldsummen von B addiert und bin auf eine Summe von 0 gekommen. Dies war ein intuitiver Schritt, hat aber dazu beigetragen, dass ich mich für A antschieden habe. Die Differenz zwischen 1000 und dem Verlust von 3000 E war mir hier zu groß.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 + (-3000) = 0, and since there are 2 outcomes, the mean is 0 / 2 = 0. For Lottery A, the sum is 1000, and since there is 1 outcome, the mean is 1000 / 1 = 1000. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the mean outcome of each lottery: 0 for Lottery B and 1000 for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the comparison of the outcomes of the two lotteries and the calculation of the sum of Lottery B's outcomes, which resulted in 0. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the large difference between the certain gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery A and the potential loss of 3000 Euros from Lottery B, which made the individual decide in favor of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of 0 for B and 1000 for A) with that considered by the individual (sum of B's outcomes and comparison of outcomes), it appears the individual did consider the sum of B's outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating the mean or comparing the means of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (focusing on the difference between potential gains and losses and the certainty of gain from A), it does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual's justification is more focused on the risk aspect and the certainty of the gain rather than the calculated mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates some consideration of the outcomes that could relate to the decision reason, but the justification provided does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome based on the calculated means. The focus on risk and certainty of gain suggests the use of a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of 6000 Euros and weighs it against the potential gain of 6000 Euros, indicating they are risk-averse and prefer to avoid the risk of losing a significant amount of money. They also mention the current amount of money they have, suggesting that their decision might be influenced by their current financial situation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential loss is not worth the potential gain, and they prefer to keep their current amount of money. They also express uncertainty about how they would decide if they had more information about their current financial situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focuses on the potential loss and gain, as well as their current financial situation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries, whereas the individual clearly prefers Lottery A (0 Euros with 100% probability) due to risk aversion. The individual’s justification is based on the potential loss and gain, rather than the mean outcome of each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason, which considers the mean outcome of each lottery. The individual's focus on risk aversion and potential loss/gain, rather than the mean outcome, suggests that they did not use the decision reason to make their decision. Therefore, the final assessment is 0, indicating that it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
