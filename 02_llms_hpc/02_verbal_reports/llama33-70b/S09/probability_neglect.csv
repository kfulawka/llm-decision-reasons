Verbal report:
sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2400 Euros. The probabilities of winning the maximum amount in Lottery A are 33%, and in Lottery B, the probability of winning 2400 Euros is 100%. However, the decision reason states that differences in probabilities are considered negligible. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries since the probability differences are deemed negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen,"" which translates to ""very low probability of winning nothing."" This implies the individual considered the probability of not winning in each lottery. For Lottery A, there's a 1% chance of winning 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, there's a 0% chance of winning 0 Euros since it offers a 100% chance of winning 2400 Euros.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the low probability of winning nothing, which could imply a concern for avoiding the outcome of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, while the individual seems to focus on the probability of not winning anything, which is somewhat tangential to the decision reason's focus.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are deemed negligible. The individual's justification, as far as can be inferred, seems more concerned with avoiding a loss (winning nothing) rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's focus and the decision reason's criteria do not directly align. The individual's concern appears to be more about avoiding a zero outcome rather than comparing the maximum possible gains between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision, as the focus and criteria mentioned in the verbal report do not closely align with the decision reason's rule. However, it is not a certainty (0), as there might be aspects of the decision-making process not fully captured in the verbal report."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and the maximum outcomes. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. The reason deems the difference in probabilities negligible and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The relevant information for this reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (2400 Euros for A and 2500 Euros for B) and their probabilities (34% for A and 33% for B). Since the probabilities are very close (1% difference), the decision reason can indeed be applied, focusing on the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the lotteries seem too similar (""sich zu identisch""), implying they considered the overall similarity between the two options but does not specify what aspects of the lotteries they compared.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they made their decision based on feeling (""nach Gefühl gewählt""), indicating an intuitive or emotional basis rather than a detailed analysis of the lotteries' specifics.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and considers the probabilities negligible due to their closeness. The individual, however, mentions the similarity between the lotteries without specifying whether they compared the maximum outcomes or the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are deemed negligible. The individual's justification is based on feeling, not on an explicit comparison of maximum outcomes or probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes when probabilities are similar. The report suggests an intuitive decision rather than a deliberate comparison of the lotteries' key aspects as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability, while Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (80% for A and 100% for B). The difference in probabilities (20%) might be considered significant by some, but the decision reason's applicability hinges on whether these differences are deemed negligible by the individual. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, but its applicability depends on the individual's perception of probability differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the good winning probability of Lottery A but also highlights the secure, high amount of 3000 Euros from Lottery B. This indicates the individual considered both the probabilities and the outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite Lottery A's good winning probability, the secure, high amount of 3000 Euros from Lottery B was preferable, especially considering the context of lower amounts (which doesn't directly apply here but suggests a thought process about trade-offs).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered both probabilities and outcomes but seemed to prioritize the secure outcome of Lottery B over the potentially higher but less secure outcome of Lottery A. This suggests the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes when probabilities are deemed negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification emphasizes the security of the outcome in Lottery B, which diverges from the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's choice seems more aligned with risk aversion or a preference for certainty rather than strictly following the decision reason's criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report suggests that the decision to choose Lottery B was based more on the security of the outcome rather than comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries when probability differences are considered negligible. This indicates that the decision reason, as specified, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the probabilities and the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A) and the probabilities (20% for Lottery B and 25% for Lottery A). The difference in probabilities (5%) might be considered negligible depending on the individual's perspective, but the decision reason specifically mentions considering such differences as negligible. Thus, the key information is the maximum outcomes and the general comparison of probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual includes the difference in the potential gain (""Ein Gewinn wäre nur 5% weniger"") and the fact that one option has a higher maximum gain (""hätte einen höheren Gewinn""). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to weigh the risk against the potential higher gain, concluding that the risk is worth it (""Das Risiko ist es wert"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and the consideration of probability differences as negligible) with that considered by the individual (difference in potential gain, higher maximum gain, and the risk), there is a partial match. The individual considers the higher maximum gain, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the individual also focuses on the risk and the 5% difference in gain, which suggests they are not entirely neglecting the probability differences as the decision reason would.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification (the risk is worth it for the higher gain), there is some alignment. The individual is willing to take on more risk for a higher potential gain, which could suggest they are prioritizing the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (focusing on the higher maximum outcome), it also introduces considerations (like the risk being worth it) that are not directly addressed by the decision reason. The individual does not explicitly state that the probability differences are negligible, but their focus on the maximum gain and willingness to accept risk for it somewhat aligns with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the emphasis on risk and the 5% difference suggests that the individual's decision-making process is not solely guided by the decision reason in question."

Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A, 3000 Euros for B) and the assessment of whether the probability differences (45% vs 90%) are negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
The verbal report mentions ""Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""high winning probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of winning in their deliberation process. However, the report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries or justify the choice based on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are considered negligible. The justification for the choice is not clearly stated beyond the consideration of high winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and the consideration of negligible probability differences) with that considered by the individual (high winning probability), there seems to be a partial overlap in that both consider probabilities, but the verbal report does not explicitly discuss maximum outcomes or the rule of preferring the higher maximum outcome when probabilities are deemed negligible. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) does not directly align with the individual's justification (focusing on high winning probability without mention of maximum outcomes). Given this, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but the consideration of probabilities suggests some overlap in the thought process.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The probabilities are indeed very low, and their difference (0.1%) could be considered negligible in the context of being very small, especially given the verbal report's mention of both being ""sehr unwahrscheinlich"" (very unlikely). The maximum outcomes are 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B, making Lottery A more favorable in terms of the maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the low probability of both lotteries (""Beide treten sehr unwahrscheinlich ein"" translates to ""Both are very unlikely to occur""). This suggests the individual is aware of the low probabilities but does not explicitly compare them in detail. Second, the individual's justification for the choice mentions taking a higher risk (""daher geht man ein höheres Risiko ein""), which implies a consideration of the potential outcomes in relation to their likelihoods, but it does not directly state which lottery was chosen or why based on the maximum outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (negligible probability differences and preference for the higher maximum outcome) with that considered by the individual (low probabilities and risk), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both consider the low probabilities, but the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) is not directly reflected in the individual's justification, which focuses more on the general risk aspect without specifying how the risk relates to the choice between the two lotteries' maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual acknowledges the low probabilities of both lotteries, there is no clear indication that they specifically compared the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the primary basis for their decision, which is central to the decision reason provided. The mention of taking a ""higher risk"" could imply consideration of the potential outcomes, but without explicit comparison or mention of preferring the higher maximum outcome due to negligible probability differences, it's uncertain and leans towards not using the decision reason as described."
7,"viel mehr als bei A

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a fixed outcome of -3000 Euros, while Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros (which is more favorable than -3000 Euros) but with only 20% probability. The difference in probabilities is significant (80% vs 20% and 100% for the certain loss in A), so the condition of negligible differences might not be directly applicable. However, the reason can still be conceptually applied to understand if the individual considered the maximum outcomes as a basis for their decision. The relevant information includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (0 Euros for B and -3000 Euros for A) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual seems to involve the concept of avoiding loss and the magnitude of potential loss. The individual mentions a ""kleine Wahrscheinlichkeit einen Verlust abzuwehren"" (a small probability of avoiding a loss), indicating awareness of the probabilistic nature of Lottery B. Second, the justification for the choice, as described, focuses on the idea that even if the less favorable outcome occurs, the loss is not significantly greater than in the alternative option (Lottery A). The individual seems to weigh the potential losses and the probability of avoiding a loss, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probability of avoiding loss and magnitude of loss), there seems to be a partial overlap. The individual does consider the probabilistic aspect but focuses more on the avoidance of loss rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes as the decision reason would suggest. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification, there is a discrepancy. The individual's justification does not explicitly prioritize the lottery based on its more favorable maximum outcome in a manner that disregards significant probability differences. Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason as defined.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report indicates a different focus (avoiding loss and comparing magnitudes of potential losses) rather than prioritizing the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome based on negligible probability differences."

Leicht bessere Chancen einen Verlust zu vermeiden

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, both lotteries have a potential maximum outcome of 0 Euros (no loss), which is the same for both. However, the decision reason focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros) as the favorable outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of avoiding a loss is 80%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. The decision reason considers the differences between the probabilities as negligible. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of avoiding a loss in each lottery: 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Leicht bessere Chancen einen Verlust zu vermeiden,"" which translates to ""slightly better chances of avoiding a loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss in their deliberation.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests the individual's focus was on avoiding a loss and perceived one option as having a slightly better chance of doing so, but it does not explicitly state which lottery was chosen or the full reasoning behind the choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of avoiding a loss) with that considered by the individual (chances of avoiding a loss), we see a match in focus, as both are concerned with the probability of not incurring a loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are considered negligible) to the individual’s justification (focusing on slightly better chances of avoiding a loss), there's an alignment in that the individual's reasoning seems to prioritize avoiding a loss, which aligns with considering the more favorable outcome in terms of loss avoidance.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report suggests they considered the aspect of avoiding a loss and its associated probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the decision reason specifically mentions considering the differences in probabilities as negligible and preferring based on the maximum outcome, which in this context is about avoiding loss. The individual's report does not explicitly mention considering the probability differences as negligible but does imply a focus on the better chance of avoiding a loss, which could suggest an implicit consideration of the probabilities being somewhat comparable or the difference being of less significance.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment in focus on avoiding loss and considering probabilities. However, it is not a perfect match due to the lack of explicit mention of considering probability differences as negligible and the specific rule for preference in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (less negative, thus more favorable in this context), and for Lottery B, it's -6000 Euros. The probabilities are 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B. However, the decision reason deems probability differences negligible. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the lotteries since the probability differences are considered negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher potential loss of Lottery B compared to Lottery A but also thought about the higher probability of avoiding this loss in Lottery B (though the statement seems slightly misinterpreted as Lottery B has a lower probability of avoiding the loss compared to Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by considering the trade-off between the potential loss and the probability of avoiding it, suggesting a focus on the risk aspect and the perceived ability to avoid loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are deemed negligible. The individual, however, seems to focus more on the trade-off between the potential loss and its probability, not directly comparing maximum outcomes as the primary criterion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are considered negligible. The individual's justification, however, doesn't directly align with this rule, as it emphasizes avoiding loss rather than comparing maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is closer to 0 because the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's focus on avoiding loss and the perceived higher probability of doing so in one of the lotteries (though misinterpreted) does not match the decision reason's criteria. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In the given lotteries, A and B, the probabilities of winning (or losing) are very close, with Lottery B having a 0.1% chance of losing €6000 and Lottery A having a 0.2% chance of losing €3000. The maximum loss (or outcome) for Lottery B is -€6000, and for Lottery A, it is -€3000. Given that the probability differences are indeed very small (0.1% vs. 0.2%), the decision reason can be applied by considering these negligible differences and focusing on the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of incurring a loss is barely given (or negligible) in both lotteries. This suggests the individual is aware of and considers the low probabilities of losing in both options.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they decided based on feeling (""nach Gefühl entschieden""), without explicitly mentioning the comparison of maximum outcomes or the specific probabilities. The justification provided does not directly reference the decision reason's criteria (negligible probability differences and preference for the more favorable maximum outcome).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual acknowledges the negligible probabilities of loss, which aligns with the first part of the decision reason. However, there's no explicit mention of comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the individual's justification. The individual's decision is attributed to ""feeling,"" which does not clearly align with or contradict the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual acknowledges the negligible probabilities (aligning with part of the decision reason), there is no clear indication that the decision was based on comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as per the decision reason. The justification provided (""nach Gefühl entschieden"") does not explicitly support the use of the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a guaranteed 500 Euros, while Lottery B offers 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The maximum outcome of Lottery B (1000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (500 Euros). The decision reason can be applied by considering the probabilities (50% for the maximum outcome in B, and 100% for the guaranteed outcome in A) and noting that the difference in probabilities (50% vs. 100%) might not be considered negligible by everyone, but the reason specifically mentions considering the maximum outcomes when differences are negligible. Thus, relevant information includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) and ""aufgrund der Höhe"" (due to the height), which implies they considered the guaranteed nature of Lottery A's outcome and possibly its amount compared to the potential of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the secure win, indicating a preference for the guaranteed outcome over the riskier option, which suggests they valued certainty over potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual seems to focus on the security of the win rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome under certain conditions, but the individual's justification emphasizes the security of the win, not directly the maximum possible outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process emphasizes security and guaranteed outcomes rather than directly comparing the maximum potential outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, the individual does not appear to have used the decision reason as described.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros (with 100% probability). The decision reason can be applied by comparing these maximum outcomes since the reason specifies considering the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The relevant information for this reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be weighing the risk against the potential outcomes, considering it might not be interesting for a player to choose the secure (but negative) outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual implies that taking a risk might be preferable to accepting a certain loss, suggesting a consideration of the potential for a ""better"" outcome (in this case, 0 Euros) over a guaranteed negative outcome (-500 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk vs. secure outcome, implying consideration of the maximum potential outcomes). The individual seems to consider the outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual’s justification (preferring the risk over the certain loss, which can be interpreted as preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, 0 Euros over -500 Euros). The individual's justification seems to align with the decision reason's rule, as they are essentially choosing based on the potential for a better maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered the risk and the potential for a better outcome, aligning with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. While the report does not explicitly state a comparison of maximum outcomes or mention the decision reason's specifics, the implication that the individual prefers the risk (associated with the potential for a 0 Euro outcome) over the certain loss (-500 Euros) suggests a decision process that aligns with the given decision reason. However, the assessment is not 100 because the verbal report does not perfectly match the decision reason's criteria, and some interpretation is required to align the individual's justification with the reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros. The probabilities of winning the maximum amount in Lottery A and Lottery B are 25% and 25%, respectively. Since the probabilities of winning the maximum amount are the same (25% in both cases), the differences can be considered negligible in this context. The information relevant to the decision reason that can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities is that Lottery B offers a higher maximum outcome (6000 Euros) than Lottery A (4000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual's statement ""Kommt mir ewas sicherer vor, überhaupt was zu gewinnen"" translates to ""Seems to me something more secure, to win something at all."" This indicates the individual is considering the aspect of security or certainty of winning something, rather than focusing on the maximum possible outcome.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around the perception of security or the certainty of winning, which implies they are looking for an option where winning some amount of money is more guaranteed or feels safer.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probabilities are considered negligible, whereas the individual focuses on the security of winning something, not explicitly mentioning the maximum outcomes or comparing them directly.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, is centered around the perceived security of winning, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prioritizes the maximum outcome when probabilities are similar. Instead, the individual's focus was on the security of winning some amount, which suggests a different decision-making criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences in probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of loss is also -4000 Euros. The probabilities of the worst outcomes in both lotteries are directly comparable since both have a 25% chance of their respective worst outcomes (-6000 Euros for A and -4000 Euros for B), but the reason focuses on the maximum outcome. Given the information, the decision reason can be applied by comparing the maximum losses.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report mentions ""geringere Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""lower loss probability."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of losses when making their decision. The justification for the choice, as described, focuses on the probability of loss rather than directly on the maximum outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probability of loss), there's a partial match. The individual considered probabilities but specifically in terms of loss, not directly the maximum outcome as the reason suggests.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification (lower loss probability), there's a discrepancy. The individual's focus was on minimizing loss probability rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The verbal report suggests a focus on loss probability, which is somewhat related but does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a guaranteed 5 Euros, while Lottery B offers 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (5000 Euros for Lottery B and 5 Euros for Lottery A) and the probabilities (0.1% for the high outcome in Lottery B and 100% for the low outcome in Lottery A). Since the probability of winning in Lottery B is very low (0.1%), it can be considered negligible compared to the certainty of winning in Lottery A. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the winning probability of Lottery B (referred to as ""Lotterie 2"") being almost 0, which indicates they considered the probability aspect of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the low winning probability of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the probabilities and the maximum outcomes. The individual mentions the probability of Lottery B, implying they considered this aspect, but there's no direct mention of comparing maximum outcomes or explicitly stating that the probability difference is negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's report highlights the very low probability of winning in Lottery B but does not explicitly justify the choice based on the maximum outcomes or the negligibility of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's consideration of the low probability of Lottery B aligns partially with the decision reason's focus on probabilities. However, the verbal report lacks explicit comparison of maximum outcomes and does not clearly state that the probability differences were considered negligible, which are crucial components of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that the decision reason was used, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since -5000 Euros is the worst outcome, not the maximum), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros. The probabilities of the lotteries are 0.1% for the negative outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the negative outcome in Lottery B. The difference in probabilities is significant for the negative outcomes, but the reason specifically mentions considering the differences negligible. However, the key factor here is the maximum outcome, which is 0 Euros for Lottery A (as it's the best outcome possible in that lottery) and -5 Euros for Lottery B. Thus, according to the reason, Lottery A would be preferred because its maximum outcome (0 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery B (-5 Euros), assuming the probability differences are considered negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report mentions ""geringe Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""low probability of loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of losing (or having a negative outcome) in their decision-making process. The report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries or justify the choice based on this comparison. However, it does focus on the aspect of probability, which is part of the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (low probability of loss), we see a partial overlap. The individual considered probabilities, which aligns with part of the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice (""low probability of loss"") does not directly align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome but does touch upon the aspect of probability, which is a component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because while the individual considered probabilities, which is a part of the decision reason, there is no clear indication that they preferred the lottery based on the maximum outcome when considering negligible probability differences, as the decision reason dictates. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of comparing maximum outcomes or applying the specific rule outlined in the decision reason, leading to a low certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (3000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros). However, the decision reason also mentions considering the differences between the probabilities of the lotteries as negligible. In this case, the probabilities are significantly different (100% for A vs. 50% for the positive outcome of B), which might not align with considering them negligible. Still, we can derive the necessary information for the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential high gain of Lottery B but also the possibility of a high loss, which led them to choose the secure outcome of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the attractiveness of a higher gain in Lottery B but ultimately chose Lottery A due to the risk of a significant loss, opting for the secure result instead.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the potential high gain (maximum outcome) of Lottery B but also heavily weighed the risk of loss, which isn't directly part of the decision reason's criteria.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B for its more favorable maximum outcome if ignoring or downplaying the probability differences. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding the risk of a high loss, not directly on comparing maximum outcomes while considering negligible probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on risk aversion and the secure outcome of Lottery A, rather than solely comparing maximum outcomes with negligible probability differences, indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2000 Euros. The probabilities relevant to the decision reason are 50% for the maximum outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the maximum outcome in Lottery B. However, the decision reason considers probability differences negligible, which might not directly apply here since one lottery has a 100% chance of a positive outcome, and the other has a 50% chance of a significant loss. Still, we can derive that the maximum outcome of Lottery A is more favorable than that of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of loss and gain in Lottery A and compares it to the certainty of a high amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to lean towards the certainty of a high amount, indicating that the risk associated with Lottery A, despite its potential for a higher gain, is a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are considered negligible. The individual, however, seems more focused on the risk aspect and the certainty of a gain, which indirectly touches upon the concept of outcomes but with a significant emphasis on risk rather than just the maximum potential gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A for its more favorable maximum outcome if ignoring the significant probability difference. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize certainty over the potential for a higher maximum outcome, suggesting a different decision-making criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on risk and certainty rather than solely on the maximum potential outcomes, as indicated in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 1000 Euros. The probabilities relevant to the decision are 50% for the maximum outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the certain outcome in Lottery B. Since the decision reason considers negligible differences in probabilities, we note that Lottery B has a certain outcome, which might not be directly comparable under the ""negligible differences"" criterion. However, the key information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of 3000 Euros for A and 1000 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk associated with Lottery A and the certain gain of Lottery B, noting the gain in B is so small that the risk of A is worth taking.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A over B because the certain gain in B is too small to outweigh the potential of A, despite its risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (3000 Euros for A, 1000 Euros for B) when probability differences are negligible. The individual considers the risk (implying the potential for loss or gain in A) and the certain but small gain in B, which aligns with considering the outcomes but also heavily weighs the certainty aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual prefers A because its potential reward is worth more than B's certain but small gain, suggesting a focus on the potential maximum outcome as a significant factor.

Given these comparisons, the individual's consideration of the risk and potential gain in A versus the certain but small gain in B, and their decision to prefer A for its higher potential, suggests alignment with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the individual also heavily considers the certainty of B's outcome, which introduces a nuance not directly addressed by the decision reason's focus on negligible probability differences. This nuance suggests the individual's decision-making process may not perfectly align with the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability, while Lottery B offers 0 Euros with 100% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery A is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros. The probabilities of winning in Lottery A are not negligible compared to Lottery B, but the reason's primary focus is on the maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible. However, we must proceed to understand how this applies to the individual's thought process.

The relevant information for the decision reason includes:
- Maximum outcomes: 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.
- Probabilities: The reason might consider the 100% probability of Lottery B as a significant factor, despite its focus on negligible differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""ZU großes Verlustrisiko bei A,"" which translates to ""Too high loss risk at A."" This indicates the individual considered the risk of loss associated with Lottery A. 

Information considered by the individual:
- The individual focused on the loss risk associated with Lottery A, implying they considered the negative outcome (-6000 Euros) and possibly its probability.

Justification for the choice:
- The individual's concern about the high loss risk suggests they were deterred by the potential loss in Lottery A, which might imply they preferred Lottery B due to its guaranteed outcome of 0 Euros, avoiding any risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparison of relevant information:
- The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's concern was the loss risk, not directly the maximum gain.

Comparison of the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome under certain conditions, but the individual's justification seems to prioritize avoiding loss over considering the maximum possible gain.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process was more influenced by the risk of loss than by comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests.
