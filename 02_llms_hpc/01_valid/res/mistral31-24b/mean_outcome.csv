0,"by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.**

The decision reason requires calculating the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, regardless of their probabilities. This information can be derived from the given lotteries.

- Lottery A outcomes: 2500, 2400, 0
- Lottery B outcomes: 2400

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

- Calculate the mean of Lottery A: (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33
- Calculate the mean of Lottery B: 2400 / 1 = 2400

Since 2400 is greater than 1633.33, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

1,"probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.**STEPS:**

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires the outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. We can derive this information from the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 2500 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 2400 Euros, 0 Euros

The relevant information for each lottery is the outcomes, and it can be directly derived from the given information, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

First, calculate the mean outcome for each lottery:
- Mean of Lottery A = (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros
- Mean of Lottery B = (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. Since 1250 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 1200 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

2,"adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.STEPS:
1. To determine which lottery to prefer we need to calculate the mean of all outcomes for each lottery.
Lottery A has two outcomes: 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros.
Lottery B has one outcome: 3000 Euros. The mean of this outcome is 3000 Euros.

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem**:
   The decision reason requires the calculation of the mean of all outcomes for each lottery. The relevant information from the lotteries is the outcomes and their probabilities. Since we have the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries, we can derive the relevant information.

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem**:
   - For Lottery A:
     - Outcomes: 6000 Euros, 0 Euros
     - Mean outcome = (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros
   - For Lottery B:
     - Outcomes: 3000 Euros, 0 Euros
     - Mean outcome = (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros

5,"of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1:** Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason requires the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. We can calculate this using the given probabilities and outcomes.

For Lottery A:
- The outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- The mean of all outcomes = (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros

For Lottery B:
- The outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- The mean of all outcomes = (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros

Since we can derive the relevant information, we proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2:** Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.

- Mean outcome of Lottery A = 3000 Euros
- Mean outcome of Lottery B = 1500 Euros

Since 3000 Euros > 1500 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

6,"outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**
The decision reason involves calculating the mean of the outcomes of each lottery. The outcomes and probabilities for both lotteries are clearly provided.
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros.

Since the relevant information (outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions, the decision reason can be applied.

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.

- Calculate the mean outcome for Lottery A:
  \[
  \text{Mean of A} = \frac{-4000 + 0}{2} = \frac{-4000}{2} = -2000 \text{ Euros}
  \]

- Calculate the mean outcome for Lottery B:
  \[
  \text{Mean of B} = \frac{-3000}{1} = -3000 \text{ Euros}
  \]

Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than the mean outcome of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

9,". The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason requires the calculation of the mean of all outcomes for each lottery. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are given as -6000, 0 for lottery A, and -3000, 0 for lottery B.

For lottery A:
- Mean = (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000

For lottery B:

13,"higher mean outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason requires the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries' outcomes.

For Lottery A:
- Outcomes: -6000, 0, 0, 0 (since 75% probability corresponds to three 0 outcomes)
- Mean of outcomes = (-6000 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 4 = -1500

For Lottery B:
- Outcomes: -4000, -2000, 0, 0 (since 50% probability corresponds to two 0 outcomes)
- Mean of outcomes = (-4000 + -2000 + 0 + 0) / 4 = -1500

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. Since the mean outcome for both Lottery A and Lottery B is -1500, the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries.
