1,"maximum probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability.**STEPS:**

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires the maximum probability of each lottery. This information can be derived from the given lotteries:

- For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (the probability of winning 0 Euros).
- For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (the probability of winning 0 Euros).
