STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. This requires evaluating the outcomes of the lotteries, which are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros for lottery A, and -3000 Euros and 0 Euros for lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes and their probabilities. The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The relevant information about the lotteries is:
- The maximum outcome of lottery A is 0 Euros.
- The maximum outcome of lottery B is 0 Euros.
- The probability of the maximum outcome of lottery A is 80% (since there's an 80% probability of getting 0 Euros).
- The probability of the maximum outcome of lottery B is 75% (since there's a 75% probability of getting 0 Euros).

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

Since the maximum outcome of both lotteries is the same (0 Euros), the decision reason compares the probabilities of this outcome.

STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. To apply this reason, we need to identify the maximum outcome of each lottery and its probability.
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and its probability is 25%.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and its probability is 0% since -4000 Euros is the maximum of the two negative outcomes, and 0 Euros is the maximum of 0 and -2000 Euros. 
However, the decision reason's rule is that the maximum outcome for lottery B is actually 4000 Euros. The probability of this is 25%.

Since the relevant information about the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery can be derived, we can proceed to Step 2.
