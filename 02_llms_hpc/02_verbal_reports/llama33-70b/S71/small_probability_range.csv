STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (since there is only one probability value). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A: 65% difference between minimum and maximum probability
- Lottery B: 0% difference between minimum and maximum probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the 1% chance of winning nothing, and the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries. They also noted the 33% chance of an additional €100 gain in Lottery A and the compensation for the 1% chance of no gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by mentioning the slightly increased expected value and the compensation for the risk of not winning, despite acknowledging the secure gain offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of expected value and risk compensation, not the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing reasons related to expected value and risk compensation, not the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. Instead, their choice was based on expected value and risk considerations, which aligns with a different decision-making criterion. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 33% (or 0.33), so the difference is 33% - 0% = 33%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 34% (or 0.34), so the difference is 34% - 0% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same, and the similarity between the gains and probabilities of the two lotteries. They also considered the difference between the possible gains and the slight increase in the winning probability of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning the slight increase in the winning probability it offers compared to Lottery A, given that the difference in possible gains is not very high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the similarity in probabilities and the increase in winning probability but does not directly address the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (33% difference vs. 34% difference for Lottery B). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its slightly higher winning probability, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not a factor mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its slightly higher winning probability and the similarity in expected values and gains, not the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery B (60%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery and the fact that Lottery A offers a certain gain, while Lottery B offers a chance at a higher gain but also a risk of no gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite Lottery B having a slightly higher expected value, Lottery A provides a secure gain, which was more appealing than the uncertain, albeit potentially higher, gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of expected value and risk versus certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A, but their justification was based on the security of the gain rather than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's choice was based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not on the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the probability of not winning is 75%) and the maximum probability is 25% (the probability of winning 3000 Euros), making the difference 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the probability of not winning is 80%) and the maximum probability is 20% (the probability of winning 4000 Euros), making the difference 20%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (25% for A and 20% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B to be slightly higher, noted that the win in Lottery A is somewhat more probable, but the possible win in Lottery B is significantly higher, and observed that the probabilities are very similar.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B due to its higher possible win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries (20% for B and 25% for A), but the individual's considerations as described in the verbal report do not explicitly mention comparing these probability differences. Instead, the individual talks about expected value, the probability of winning, and the magnitude of the potential win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 20% difference. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its higher possible win, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The justification provided is based on the expected value and the magnitude of the potential win, not the probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 55% probability, implying the outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (for 6000 Euros), so the difference is 45% - 0% = 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 10% probability) and the maximum probability is 90% (for 3000 Euros), so the difference is 90% - 0% = 90%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery A has a smaller difference (45%) compared to Lottery B (90%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, and they compare the chances of winning in each lottery, mentioning that Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high gain, while Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because the chance of winning is significantly higher with B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the expected value and the comparative chances of winning, not the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B because of its higher chance of winning, not because of the probability difference between the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability to make their decision. The focus in the verbal report is on the expected value and the comparative chances of winning, rather than the range of probabilities.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers the chance of a twice as high gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having a very low probability of winning, Lottery A offers a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference) over Lottery A (99.8% difference). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the higher potential gain and not the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (as there is no range). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery, noting that Lottery A has a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B. They also considered the nature of the losses (whether they are certain or not) and the probability of not incurring a loss with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries involving losses of similar magnitude, Lottery A offers a good chance of not losing anything, which outweighed the consideration of the expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, but the individual's considerations as described do not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (since 0% difference is smaller than 60% difference). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the presence of a chance to avoid loss and the similarity in loss magnitude, not on the probability range difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason emphasizes the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, which is not mentioned in the individual's justification. Instead, the individual focused on the expected values, the certainty of loss in one option, and the chance to avoid loss in the other. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (minimum) and 75% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% (minimum) and 80% (maximum), also resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A to be slightly higher, acknowledged that both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss, and noted that the loss in Lottery A is lower but only marginally more probable than in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a slightly higher expected value and a lower loss that is only marginally more probable compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses probabilities and expected values but does not directly compare the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 50% difference compared to Lottery B's 60% difference. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value and the specific probabilities of loss, not the range of probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on expected value and specific loss probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 10% and 90%, resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, resulting in a difference of 10%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which in this case is Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, specifically the probability ranges.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries (mentioning they are the same), the high loss probability of both, but noted that the loss probability is higher for A than for B. They also considered the potential loss amount and its probability for both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite the potential loss being twice as high, the difference in probabilities (loss being ""deutlich höher"" or clearly higher for A) made B a preferable choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of loss and their differences, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, which is Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B, citing the significant difference in loss probabilities as a key factor, which seems to align with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual considered factors that align with the decision reason, specifically focusing on the probability differences and their impact on the decision. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the sole or primary reason. The mention of expected values and the magnitude of potential losses also played a role in the decision-making process.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as the only other probability given is 0.2% for -3000 Euros, implying the rest, 99.8%, is for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (similarly implied, with 0.1% for -6000 Euros and the rest, 99.9%, for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 99.9%. The difference for Lottery A is 99.8% - 0% = 99.8%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.9% - 0% = 99.9%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these differences: 99.8% for Lottery A vs. 99.9% for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report considers the expected value of both lotteries as equal. It mentions the possible loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A and notes both losses have very low probabilities. The individual decided on Lottery A because the loss is only half of Lottery B's loss. The information considered by the individual includes the expected value, the magnitude of potential losses, and their probabilities. The justification for choosing Lottery A focuses on the lesser magnitude of the potential loss and the low probabilities of these losses.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (expected value, loss magnitudes, and their probabilities), there is no direct mention or consideration of the probability range differences in the verbal report. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.8% difference vs. 99.9% for B), but the individual's justification is based on the magnitude of losses and their low probabilities, not the probability differences. Therefore, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), making the difference 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), making the difference 0%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries offer the same expected value, that Lottery B offers a secure win of 500 Euros, and that Lottery A has the possibility of winning nothing, with both possible winnings being of a similar magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the secure win of Lottery B because it avoids the possibility of winning nothing and presumably because the secure gain was preferable given the similar expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the security of the gain, the possibility of winning nothing, and the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, but based on the security of the gain and the avoidance of the possibility of winning nothing, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 50%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 25%.
This information is relevant to understanding which lottery the decision reason would prefer, based on the rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value. They also consider the structure of the lotteries, with Lottery A offering a chance at a high gain and Lottery B offering a double chance at a similarly high or significantly lower gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual decided on Lottery B because it offers a double chance of winning compared to Lottery A, and the possible win amounts are in the same order of magnitude. This suggests the individual focused on the probability of winning and the relative magnitudes of the potential gains.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, Lottery B has a smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same. They also considered the probability of loss and the size of potential losses in both lotteries, acknowledging that while the probability of a loss is higher in Lottery B, the losses themselves are smaller.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher probability of a loss, the potential losses are smaller compared to the maximum loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the probability of losses and their magnitudes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on the consideration of loss magnitudes and probabilities, not explicitly the difference in probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (both prefer Lottery B), but the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification is more closely related to the expected losses and their magnitudes rather than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly mention or imply consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. However, it is not a 0 because the choice made (preferring Lottery B) coincidentally aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, albeit for different stated reasons."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%
- Lottery B: Difference = 99.8%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, but noted the significant difference in the likelihood of winning between Lottery A and Lottery B. Specifically, they recognized that Lottery B offers a very unlikely win, whereas Lottery A offers a small but certain win.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery A over Lottery B because, given that only one round is relevant, they preferred the certainty of a small win offered by Lottery A over the highly uncertain win of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual discussed the probability of winning in each lottery, they did not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities (i.e., the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities) as their decision criterion. Instead, they emphasized the certainty of the win in Lottery A versus the uncertainty in Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual chose Lottery A but based their decision on the certainty of the win rather than explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was made using the specific criterion of comparing probability ranges. The individual's justification focuses more on the certainty of the win in Lottery A rather than the comparison of probability differences between the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 99.8%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: The verbal report states that both lotteries have the same expected value. The individual considered the characteristics of each lottery, noting that Lottery B offers a small but certain loss, while Lottery A has a very low probability of a very high loss. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the significant difference in potential loss between the two lotteries, with Lottery A's potential loss being much higher and Lottery B's loss being very small.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability differences) with that considered by the individual (expected value, potential losses), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the probability differences between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of the loss in Lottery B compared to the high but unlikely loss in Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the concept of probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B, but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly mention the difference in probability ranges as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while the outcome of the decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0% and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain of Lottery A, the potential for a higher gain and the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B, and the expected value of Lottery B being lower than that of A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain, and despite Lottery B offering a chance at a higher amount, it also comes with a significant risk of loss and a lower expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's considerations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason does not provide a basis for preference between them. The individual's justification, however, is based on the security of the gain, the risk of loss, and the expected value, not the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for both outcomes) and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, implying no other outcome has a probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%
- Lottery B: Difference = 100%
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual considered the security of the gain offered by Lottery B.
- The individual compared the expected values of the two lotteries, noting Lottery B has a higher expected value.
- The individual recognized the risk of a high loss in Lottery A.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure gain and a higher expected value compared to Lottery A, which has a risk of a high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
- The individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries but focus on the security and expected value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%).
- The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its secure gain and higher expected value, not on the probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on security and expected value does not reflect a consideration of the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%) between their minimum and maximum probabilities, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion alone.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries (1000€ for Lottery A and 0€ for Lottery B), the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B, and the risk of a significant loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by highlighting its secure gain of 1000€, comparing it favorably to the risk of loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the individual's deliberation, as reported, does not mention or consider these probability differences explicitly. Instead, the individual focuses on expected values and the security of the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities (0%). However, the individual chose Lottery A based on its secure gain and the avoidance of potential loss, not based on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, was used to make the decision. The individual's focus was on expected values and the security of the gain, not on the probability differences between the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a chance at a high gain but also a high loss, and Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. The individual also considered the high possible loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss in Lottery B is very high and has a moderate (mittelere) probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's considerations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value, potential gains and losses, and the probability of loss, not on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, was considered or applied in making the decision. The focus of the individual's deliberation was on expected values, potential outcomes, and their probabilities, rather than on the specific rule of comparing differences in probability ranges. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
