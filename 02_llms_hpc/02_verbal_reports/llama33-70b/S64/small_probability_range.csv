Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, so the difference is 65%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, so the difference is 0%. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: minimum probability = 1%, maximum probability = 66%, difference = 65%
- Lottery B: minimum probability = 100%, maximum probability = 100%, difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it has a guaranteed gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual considered the guarantee of the gain in Lottery B, not explicitly the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a difference of 0%. The individual's justification is based on the guarantee of the gain, not directly on the probability differences, but the outcome (preference for Lottery B) aligns with what the decision reason would suggest.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention considering the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. However, the individual's choice and justification (focusing on the guarantee of gain in Lottery B) indirectly align with the outcome the decision reason would suggest. This indirect alignment and the lack of explicit consideration of probability differences lead to a low assessment score, indicating it is unlikely but not entirely impossible that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 34% = 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, so the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (32% for A and 34% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of winning nothing (Null) between the two lotteries and the difference in the possible winnings. Specifically, they noted that Lottery B had a 1 percentage point lower probability of winning nothing and a possible gain 100€ higher than Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of not winning and the potential winnings, focusing on the slightly higher potential gain and the slightly lower probability of not winning in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the difference in the probability of winning nothing and the difference in potential winnings between the lotteries, not directly addressing the range of probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities but rather compares specific outcomes and their probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as it is defined. The individual's focus was more on the specific probabilities of certain outcomes and their differences rather than the range of probabilities across all outcomes for each lottery.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implied, as there is only one outcome with 100% probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. 
However, given the nature of Lottery B, with only one outcome at 100%, a more appropriate interpretation might consider its range as 0% since there's no actual variation in outcome probability, making the difference 0%. 
But based on the strict definition provided, we'll proceed with the calculated differences for a literal assessment: 60% for A and 100% for B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B being lower than the possible win of Lottery A (4 out of 5 times). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose B despite its lower guaranteed win compared to the possible win of A, implying a consideration of certainty over potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability differences within each lottery, while the individual seems to focus on the comparison between the guaranteed outcome of B and the potential outcomes of A, not directly addressing the internal probability ranges of each lottery. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A based on the initial calculation (60% vs 100%). However, the interpretation of Lottery B's probability range could alter this. The individual's justification, however, doesn't directly reference the probability differences within each lottery but rather the comparative outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the internal probability differences of each lottery. The verbal report indicates a consideration of outcome certainty versus potential, not the range of probabilities within each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 80% probability) and the maximum probability is 20%. The difference is 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 75% probability) and the maximum probability is 25%. The difference is 25%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (20% vs 25%) between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos"" which translates to ""viewing all information"" and ""Zufallsauswahl"" which translates to ""random selection"", and that both lotteries are ""ziemlich ähnlich"" which means ""pretty similar"". This implies the individual considered the overall characteristics of both lotteries and found them similar but does not specify what aspects were considered similar.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to suggest a random choice due to the similarity of the lotteries but does not provide a clear justification based on specific aspects like probabilities or outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of probability differences, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention considering the differences in probabilities between the lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller probability difference, but the individual's justification is based on the similarity of the lotteries and possibly a random selection, without mentioning probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for the 6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (for the 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 80%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the size of the win (Gewinn) and the probability (Wahrscheinlichkeit) of winning in both lotteries. Specifically, they noted that the win in Lottery B is half as large as in Lottery A, but the probability of winning in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite the win being half as large, the probability of winning is twice as high, and since the game is played only once, these factors led them to prefer Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (size of the win and probability of winning), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the relative sizes of the wins and probabilities), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual chose Lottery B not because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities (it actually has a larger difference), but because of the trade-off between the win size and the probability of winning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both cases (1 in 1000 vs 2 in 1000) and the potential for a twice as high win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the possibility of a potentially double win despite recognizing both lotteries have low winning probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the comparison of the winning probabilities and the potential win amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher win, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual does not seem to consider the specific rule of the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) in their deliberation process. Instead, they focus on the winning probabilities and the potential win amounts.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (-4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (-3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 60%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery A (1 out of 5 chance, which translates to 20% probability of 0 Euros). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because there is at least a chance (1 out of 5) to not lose anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A, not on comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the chance of avoiding loss, not explicitly considering the probability differences between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, making the difference 60%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, making the difference 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 60%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount and its probability, mentioning that the loss in Lottery B is smaller but also somewhat more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, even though it's slightly more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the loss amount and its probability, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the smaller loss amount and not the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the choice was justified by the smaller loss amount in Lottery B, despite its slightly higher probability. This mismatch suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 10% probability, but since the outcome is 0, we consider the probability of the other outcome as the maximum, which is 90%) and the maximum probability is 90%. The difference is 90% - 10% = 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (since -6000 Euros has a lower probability than 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55%. The difference is 55% - 45% = 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and the possibility of winning 0 Euros (or not losing) for both lotteries. They noted that the possible loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A but also observed that the possibility of not losing (getting 0 Euros) is higher in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite the higher possible loss, the higher probability of not losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery B outweighed the consideration of the loss amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the magnitude of losses and the probabilities of not losing, not the differences between probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a difference of 10% compared to Lottery A's 80%. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these probability differences but rather weighs the potential loss against the probability of no loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%. The difference for Lottery A is 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.8% - 0.2% = 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount and the risk (probability of loss) associated with each lottery, noting that the loss in Lottery B is half that of Lottery A but with double the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss, although with double the risk, is only half as much as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the loss amounts and their associated risks. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference) over Lottery A (99.8% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the comparison of loss amounts and risks, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. Instead, the individual's decision was based on a different criterion (loss amount and risk comparison).

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery B (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win aspect of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of the guaranteed win, implying they valued the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which translates to the certainty or variability of outcomes. The individual considered the guaranteed aspect of Lottery A, which aligns with preferring less variability in outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with less difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities, which aligns with the individual’s preference for the guaranteed win of Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process aligns with the principles of the decision reason, as both prioritize the reduction of uncertainty or the preference for guaranteed outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros, implying a 0% chance of getting anything worse than 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). However, to correctly apply the reason, we interpret it as looking at the range of probabilities associated with different outcomes. Thus, for Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% for -1000 Euros and 50% for 0 Euros, indicating a range but the key difference in probabilities between the worst and best outcome is 0% since both outcomes have the same probability. For Lottery B, there's only one outcome with 100% probability, so the difference is 0% (since there's no range of probabilities for different outcomes). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges for each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that with Lottery A, there is at least a chance to lose nothing (""Ansehen aller Infos bei A besteht wenigstens eine Chance nichts zu verlieren""). This indicates the individual focused on the aspect of having a chance to avoid loss in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided in the verbal report emphasizes the presence of a chance to not lose anything with Lottery A, which suggests the individual valued this aspect in making their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on having a chance to lose nothing. The individual's consideration is more about the presence of a zero-loss outcome rather than the probability differences between outcomes within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B or indifference since both lotteries could be interpreted as having a '0' difference under a strict reading (given Lottery B has only one outcome and Lottery A's probabilities for its two outcomes are equal). The individual's justification, however, is based on the presence of a chance to not lose anything, not directly on the probability differences between outcomes.

For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) when making the decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the winning probability is higher.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual chose the lottery with the higher winning probability.
Based on these two comparisons, it seems that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the size and probability of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (25% difference) over Lottery B (50% difference). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the smaller possible loss, not directly on the difference in probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A, which is low but certain, and the high but uncertain win of Lottery B, which has a 1 in 1000 chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win, although low, is guaranteed, whereas Lottery B only offers a chance to win a higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered the certainty of the win in Lottery A and the uncertainty (but not explicitly the probability range) of Lottery B. While the individual's considerations touch upon aspects of certainty and uncertainty, they do not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A, but based on the guarantee of the win rather than the probability range. The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) but does not explicitly use the decision reason’s rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual chooses Lottery A, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the justification provided is based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the probability range comparison. This suggests that the decision reason was not explicitly used by the individual, but there is a slight alignment in the outcome of the choice. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a minor, indirect alignment."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (0% vs 99.8%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential loss of Lottery B but noted it was very unlikely, comparing it to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high loss, although significant, was very unlikely compared to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, while the individual considered the likelihood of the high loss in Lottery B versus the guaranteed loss in Lottery A. The individual's focus was more on the specific outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it based on the low probability of the high loss, not directly addressing the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the probability of the high loss in Lottery B and compared it to the guaranteed loss in Lottery A, rather than considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, the win is guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the win is guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0% for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the guarantee of the win with Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, preferred Lottery A because the win is guaranteed, not because of the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the guarantee of the win, not on the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers these probability differences and the individual's verbal report does not mention this consideration, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% (minimum) and 50% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% (both minimum and maximum), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The report mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and deciding for Lottery A due to a guaranteed win (""garantiertem Gewinn""). This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the guaranteed win of Lottery A, which suggests the individual valued the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering these probability differences. Instead, it highlights the guaranteed win of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The individual's justification, however, is based on the guaranteed win of Lottery A, not on the comparison of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The report emphasizes the guaranteed win of Lottery A, which does not reflect the consideration of probability differences as per the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences, we can derive that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the context of the reason suggests looking for the smallest difference, which in a typical scenario would involve non-zero differences. The relevant information here is that both lotteries have guaranteed outcomes in terms of probability (one has a fixed outcome, and the other has two equally likely outcomes), but the decision reason specifically looks at the probability range.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed win, while Lottery A has a possible loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a win, implying the avoidance of a possible loss in Lottery A was a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual's consideration was about the guarantee of a win versus the possibility of a loss, not directly addressing the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual's justification was based on the guarantee of a win, not the probability range.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the probability ranges rather than the guarantee of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Thus, both lotteries have the same difference between their minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have equal differences in their probability ranges.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all the information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and notes that a win is possible with Lottery A (""Gewinn möglich, darum A""). This suggests the individual considered the potential outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because a win is possible, implying the potential for a positive outcome was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more about the possibility of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason does not provide a basis for preference between the two. The individual's justification, however, is based on the possibility of winning, not on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision. The verbal report does not mention or imply consideration of probability differences, and the decision reason itself would not lead to a preference for one lottery over the other in this specific case.
