1,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of getting more money (33% chance of getting 2500 Euros), the low probability of getting 0 Euros, and the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice of Lottery A by considering the high probability (99%) of winning a significant amount in Lottery A compared to the 100% chance in Lottery B, and the relatively small difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probabilities and the potential for higher gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual’s justification is based on the comparison of probabilities and potential gains, not the mean outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the probabilistic outcomes and the potential for higher gain rather than calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (1250 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1200 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries and the difference in the amounts that can be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher amount because, given similar probabilities, they wanted the chance to win more.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the difference in the amounts that can be won, which is related but not the same as calculating the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the higher amount (because the probabilities are similar) aligns with preferring Lottery A but does not explicitly mention calculating means or considering the outcomes in the way the decision reason does.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. However, the individual's focus on the higher amount when probabilities are similar indirectly leads to the same choice as the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), but through a different rationale that emphasizes the direct comparison of potential winnings under similar probability conditions rather than calculating mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the specific rule of calculating mean outcomes to make their decision. The reasoning provided in the report is more aligned with comparing potential winnings under similar probability conditions, which is a different rationale."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2000 Euros), according to this decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference between the risky outcome of 4000 Euros and the safe outcome of 3000 Euros, noting the discrepancy is relatively small. They also considered the risk of getting 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the safe option (Lottery B) because the difference between the potential gain and the certain gain is small, and they would rather have the certainty of getting a smaller amount of money than risk getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the difference between outcomes and the certainty of one of the options.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery B based on the calculated mean outcomes, whereas the individual prefers Lottery B due to the preference for certainty over a potentially higher but risky gain.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the mean outcome calculation as their decision reason. Instead, their decision was influenced by the desire for certainty and the perceived small difference between the potential outcomes. However, the outcome of their decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and it prefers Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the ""höheren Gewinn"" (higher win) and the ""niedrigere Chance"" (lower chance), indicating they looked at the potential winnings and the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the higher win and the relatively small difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (higher win and lower chance), it seems the individual focused on the maximum possible outcome and its probability rather than calculating a mean outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the higher win and relatively small difference in probabilities), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's calculation of mean outcomes independent of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates they considered the maximum possible outcomes and their probabilities, not the mean of all outcomes as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning a high amount in Lottery B and compared it with the probability of winning in Lottery A, focusing on the trade-off between the amount and the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the probability of winning the high amount was ""relativ hoch"" (relatively high), making the risk worthwhile for the higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are calculated independently of their probabilities. In contrast, the individual's deliberation process, as described, focuses on the probabilities of winning and the risk associated with each lottery, not explicitly on calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but justified it based on the perceived high probability of winning the higher amount and the willingness to take the risk, not explicitly mentioning or implying a calculation of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by simply averaging the outcomes. The focus in the report is on the probability of winning and the risk, rather than on the mean outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."
6,"wenn auf Lotterie A setze die mir im Ausnahmefall einen höheren Geldbetrag zukommen lassen würde als Lotterie B.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be calculated as follows:
- Lottery A: (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000
- Lottery B: (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500
The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The information considered by the individual includes the low probability of winning in both lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the potential higher gain from Lottery A in the exceptional case of winning, given that the chance of winning is very low in both lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (low probability of winning and potential higher gain), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because of its higher potential gain in the case of winning indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual's reasoning is based on the exceptional case of winning rather than the calculated mean, but it leads to a preference for Lottery A, which is the same preference as the decision reason. Given this, it seems the individual's thought process shares a similar outcome preference with the decision reason but does not directly apply the mean calculation as the decision reason does.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because -2000 is greater than -3000. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 80% probability of losing 4000 Euros in Lottery B, indicating they considered the probability and outcome of this lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because the 80% probability of a significant loss in Lottery B is perceived as too great a risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve considering probabilities as weights. However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived risk associated with the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery B, not on calculating mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. In contrast, the individual chooses Lottery A due to risk aversion related to the high probability of a significant loss, not because of a comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on the risk associated with the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery B, rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome regardless of probabilities, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the worst-case scenario (losing less money) and compared the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on losing less money in the worst case and a comparison of the probabilities, noting that the lower amount (loss) occurs relatively more often in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (worst-case scenario and probabilities), there is a partial overlap in that the individual does consider the outcomes but focuses more on the worst-case scenario and its probability rather than calculating a mean outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the less severe worst-case loss and considering probabilities), the individual's reasoning does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule of calculating mean outcomes. The individual's focus is more on the risk of loss and its probability rather than on the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers the outcomes of the lotteries, the primary focus of the decision reason (calculating and comparing mean outcomes) is not explicitly mentioned or applied in the verbal report. The individual's justification is based on a different aspect (worst-case scenario and probability comparison), indicating that the decision reason was likely not used as the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -1500 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compares the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries, noting that while the probability of losing in Lottery B is 55%, the probability of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A is 90%. The individual also mentions that statistically, more than every second outcome in Lottery B results in 0 Euros.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the comparison of losing probabilities and the high likelihood of losing a significant amount in Lottery A, but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probabilities of losing and the comparative risks rather than the mean outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the comparison of probabilities of losing money and the perceived risk, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes to make the decision. The focus was more on the probabilities and risks associated with each lottery rather than the mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to this reason, Lottery A is preferred because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros) compared to Lottery B (-3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing money in both lotteries as very low and mentions that if a loss occurs, they would prefer to lose 3000 Euros (Lottery A) rather than 6000 Euros (Lottery B) given almost the same probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on preferring a smaller loss when the probability of losing is almost the same for both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, while the individual focuses on the preference for a smaller loss given similar probabilities of losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual also chooses Lottery A but justifies this choice based on a preference for losing less money when the probabilities of losing are almost equal, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 500 / 1 = 500 Euros. Since the mean outcomes are the same for both lotteries, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the discrepancy between the possible gain/loss and the sure gain, indicating they thought about the risk involved in choosing Lottery B over the certainty of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the sure 500 Euros because the discrepancy between the possible gain/loss and the sure gain was not high enough to justify taking the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve considering the risk or the discrepancy between possible outcomes as described in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chose based on risk aversion, not the mean outcome calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of calculating mean outcomes and preferring the lottery with the higher mean.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500 Euros. Since the mean outcomes can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50% chance of maintaining their current amount (implied by the 50% chance of 0 Euros in Lottery A) and compared it to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that a 50% chance of maintaining their amount is preferable to a certain loss of 500 Euros, implying that the risk of losing 1000 Euros is mitigated by the equal chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are -500 Euros for both. However, the individual's consideration focuses on the probability of maintaining their current amount and the certainty of loss, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (-500 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, indicates a preference based on the probability of maintaining their current amount, not directly on the mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The individual's focus on the probability of maintaining their current amount and the certainty of loss in Lottery B does not reflect the calculation or consideration of mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros, so the mean is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the general probability of winning money in Lottery B, which is 50%, and notes that the amounts are smaller but the winning probability is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the higher winning probability in Lottery B, despite the smaller amounts, implying that the justification is related to the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning and amount): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focus on the probability of winning): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual emphasizes the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of not losing money (getting 0 Euros) in both lotteries and notes it is higher in Lottery B than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by comparing the probabilities of not losing money and acknowledges the higher potential loss in Lottery B but focuses on the higher probability of ending up with no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean of all outcomes, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities of specific outcomes like not losing money. The individual, however, focuses on the probability of not losing money, which does not align with calculating the mean outcome of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing the mean outcomes or any calculation involving the sum of outcomes divided by their number. Instead, the justification is based on the probability of avoiding a loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (2500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (5 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small chance of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A, the guaranteed 5 Euros in Lottery B, the high discrepancy between the potential winnings of the two lotteries, and the fact that their maximum loss would be 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the potential gain is significantly higher than the guaranteed but low amount in Lottery B, and they have nothing to lose since the maximum loss is 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (chance of winning, guaranteed amounts, discrepancy between winnings, maximum loss): The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (high potential gain, nothing to lose): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. Instead, it focuses on the potential gain and the concept of having nothing to lose.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of the decision reason that compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make the choice. The focus was on the potential high gain, the guaranteed low amount in the other lottery, and the concept of not having anything to lose, rather than on calculating and comparing mean outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of losing a high amount in Lottery A and notes that a loss is certain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the probability of losing a high amount in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B, without explicitly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating mean outcomes based on all outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on probabilities and the certainty of outcomes rather than the mean of all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (-5 Euros is higher than -2500 Euros). However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing mean outcomes but rather discusses the probability and certainty of losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries based on their outcomes alone, ignoring probabilities. The focus on probabilities and the certainty of loss in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1500) / 1 = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 1500 Euros with a 100% probability in Lottery B and the risk of losing money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certainty of winning 1500 Euros over the risk of losing money, indicating a preference for the sure gain over the gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries (0 Euros for A and 1500 Euros for B), while the individual considered the certainty of winning and the risk of losing money. The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual's preference for the certain gain of 1500 Euros over the risky option. However, the individual's justification is based on the preference for certainty rather than an explicit calculation of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or using the specific rule of the decision reason. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the justification provided is based on a preference for certainty rather than the calculated mean outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to this reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""kleine Diskrepanz der Beträge"" (small discrepancy in amounts) and the fact that they have more to lose, indicating a consideration of the potential losses and gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the ""sichere Variante"" (safe option) because they are happier with a smaller, certain gain than with a comparably low gain and the risk of high loss. This indicates a risk-averse attitude, focusing on avoiding high losses and preferring certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the discrepancy in amounts, potential losses, and the preference for a certain gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual also chooses Lottery B but justifies this choice based on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, the justification provided in the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus is more on the risk associated with the choices rather than the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the certain gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery B and the 50% chance of gaining 3000 Euros (or losing 3000 Euros) from Lottery A.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is the 50% chance of gaining three times the amount offered by Lottery B, despite acknowledging the greater risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (specific outcomes and their probabilities), it appears the individual focused on the potential gains and the certainty of one option versus the risk and potential higher reward of the other, rather than calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery A for its potential higher gain despite the risk), it's clear the individual's decision process does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a high amount, the chance of winning a high amount, and the 50% probability of winning. They also acknowledged that Lottery B is safer.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the 50% chance of winning a high amount was appealing, despite acknowledging the risk and the safety of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and the safety of the options, not the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the chance of winning, not the mean outcome. This indicates that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning and the safety of the lotteries, not on the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
