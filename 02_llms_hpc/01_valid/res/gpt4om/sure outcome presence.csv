sure outcome presence
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the decision reason. The decision reason specifies a preference for the lottery that contains a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is no sure outcome because there is a 1% probability of receiving 0 Euros. In Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. Since the relevant information indicates that only Lottery B has a sure outcome, we can proceed to Step 2. 

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. According to the decision reason, it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Since Lottery B has a sure outcome while Lottery A does not, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess whether the decision reason can be applied strictly to the decision problem.
- Lottery A offers a potential outcome of 2500 Euros with a 33% chance and 0 Euros with a 67% chance. It does not provide a sure outcome.
- Lottery B offers a potential outcome of 2400 Euros with a 34% chance and 0 Euros with a 66% chance. It also does not provide a sure outcome.
- Since neither lottery offers a sure outcome (an outcome that is guaranteed), the decision reason cannot be applied in a strict manner. 

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason specifies that it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this problem, Lottery B offers a certain 3000 Euros with a 100% probability, whereas Lottery A has an uncertain outcome (4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability). The relevant information extracted indicates that Lottery A has no sure outcome, while Lottery B does.

Step 2: Applying the decision reason, since Lottery B offers a sure outcome (3000 Euros with 100% probability) and Lottery A does not provide such certainty, the reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the decision problem:
- Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with a 20% probability and 0 Euros with an 80% probability. There is no sure outcome in this lottery since the outcome of 4000 Euros is not guaranteed.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability. Similar to Lottery A, there is also no sure outcome in this lottery. 

Since neither lottery provides a sure outcome, I determine that the decision reason cannot strictly apply to either lottery, as it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
Given that there is no sure outcome in either Lottery A or Lottery B, I conclude that the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. The decision reason values the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery A has a 45% chance of receiving 6000 Euros and a 55% chance of receiving 0 Euros, which means there is no guaranteed monetary outcome. Lottery B has a 90% chance of receiving 3000 Euros and a 10% chance of receiving 0 Euros; therefore, it has a sure outcome of getting 3000 Euros with 90% probability. Since only Lottery B provides a significant probability of a positive guaranteed outcome compared to Lottery A, we can apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery B has a stronger sure outcome (90% chance of getting 3000 Euros) compared to Lottery A which does not guarantee an outcome above 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason clearly prefers Lottery B based on the presence of a sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess whether the decision reason can be applied strictly. The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.8% probability. Both lotteries have no sure outcomes (100% probability for any monetary amount), hence the decision reason cannot identify a preferred lottery. 

Step 2: Since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the decision reason remains indifferent between Lottery A and Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries based on their outcomes and probabilities. Lottery A has a 20% chance of receiving 0 Euros and an 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros. Lottery B, on the other hand, has a sure outcome of losing 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The decision reason is concerned with the presence of a sure outcome; thus, Lottery B has a sure outcome (albeit a loss), whereas Lottery A offers no sure outcome since it has a chance of receiving 0 Euros (which is not a gain). Therefore, we can derive relevant information.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. According to the decision reason, since Lottery B presents a sure outcome (losing 3000 Euros), and Lottery A does not provide a sure outcome, the reason clearly prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries. 
- Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 80%. 
- Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 75%. 
In both lotteries, there is a sure outcome (0 Euros) but in each case, the probabilities differ. The relevant information indicates that both lotteries have a sure outcome, thus we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the better sure outcome. Lottery A has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a higher probability (80%) compared to Lottery B's sure outcome of 0 Euros at a lower probability (75%). Since 80% (for A) is greater than 75% (for B), we conclude that the decision reason prefers Lottery A over Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries. 
- Lottery A has outcomes of -6000 Euros (45% probability) and 0 Euros (55% probability), where neither outcome is certain; thus, there is no sure outcome in A.
- Lottery B has -3000 Euros (90% probability) and 0 Euros (10% probability); again, there is no sure outcome in B.

Since neither lottery offers a sure outcome, the relevant information derived from the decision reason cannot be strictly applied, leading to an indifference between the lotteries.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. 
Based on the decision reason, since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the reason does not prefer one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries for the presence of a sure outcome. 
- Lottery A: There is a sure outcome of 0 Euros, as it occurs with a 99.9% probability. 
- Lottery B: There is also a sure outcome of 0 Euros, as it occurs with a 99.8% probability. 

Both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason based on the presence of the sure outcome.
- Both lotteries provide a sure outcome of 0 Euros, which means they are equal in terms of the decision reason. Therefore, the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Evaluate both lotteries based on the presence of a sure outcome. 
- Lottery A offers 1000 Euros with a 50% chance and 0 Euros with a 50% chance. This means there is no sure outcome; the result is uncertain depending on the probabilities.
- Lottery B offers 500 Euros with a 100% chance. This is a sure outcome as it guarantees a monetary gain of 500 Euros regardless of any probabilities.

Since relevant information indicates that Lottery B has a sure outcome and Lottery A does not, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. 
The decision reason specifically states it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Since Lottery B has a sure outcome while Lottery A does not, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries based on the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery A has two possible outcomes: -1000 Euros (50% probability) and 0 Euros (50% probability). There is no sure outcome in lottery A. On the other hand, lottery B has a definite outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability, which qualifies as a sure outcome. Thus, the relevant information derived indicates that only lottery B has a sure outcome, while lottery A does not.

Step 2: Applying the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, we see that lottery B has a sure outcome (-500 Euros) while lottery A does not. Therefore, according to the rule of the decision reason, the preference clearly aligns with lottery B, as it contains a guaranteed result.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries for the presence of a sure outcome. Lottery A has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a 75% probability, while Lottery B does not have a sure outcome since the lowest possible outcome (0 Euros) has a probability of 50%. Thus, in terms of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, we assess that Lottery A has a ""sure outcome"" because if the outcome isn't the winning amount, it will definitely be 0 Euros, while Lottery B's outcomes are probabilistic without a guaranteed return. Therefore, relevant information shows that Lottery A has an aspect of certainty (0 Euros output) that the decision reason can weigh against the uncertainty in Lottery B.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome and Lottery A is the only option providing a sure outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the presence of a sure outcome in both lotteries. Lottery A has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a 75% probability, while Lottery B has no sure outcome as it provides a mix of negative and zero outcomes. Therefore, it is clear that Lottery A has a preferable sure outcome.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery that contains a sure outcome, and Lottery A has the sure outcome of 0 Euros with a 75% probability, while Lottery B does not, the decision reason clearly prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assessing the lotteries: Lottery A offers a high payoff of 5000 Euros with a very low probability (0.1%) and a very high chance (99.9%) of receiving nothing (0 Euros). Lottery B offers a guaranteed (100% probability) payoff of 5 Euros. The presence of a sure outcome is clearly in Lottery B since it guarantees a return, while Lottery A does not guarantee any amount.
   
2. Applying the decision reason: The decision reason specifies that it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Since Lottery B has a certain payout (5 Euros with 100% probability) and Lottery A does not guarantee any winnings (with the majority chance of receiving 0 Euros), the decision reason clearly prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: In this decision problem, Lottery A offers a very small probability (0.1%) of receiving -5000 Euros and a large probability (99.9%) of receiving 0 Euros. Lottery B has a certain outcome of -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The decision reason specifies a preference for a lottery that includes a sure outcome. Thus, Lottery B, with its guaranteed outcome of -5 Euros, meets the criterion of having a sure outcome, while Lottery A does not have a sure outcome.

Step 2: According to the decision reason, since Lottery B has a sure outcome and Lottery A does not, the reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries. Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with a 50% probability and -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, meaning it is uncertain (not a sure outcome). Lottery B has a certain outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability, which is a sure outcome. Since relevant information can be derived regarding the presence of a sure outcome, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. The decision reason clearly specifies a preference for the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery B has a sure outcome, while Lottery A does not. Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries for the presence of a sure outcome.
- Lottery A offers an outcome of 3000 Euros with a probability of 50% and -3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. There is no sure outcome; it is uncertain.
- Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros with a probability of 100%. 
Since Lottery B has a sure outcome, while Lottery A does not, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery A has no sure outcome, while Lottery B has a sure outcome of 2000 Euros. According to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred due to its sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: The relevant information from the lotteries is as follows:
- Lottery A offers a 50% chance of gaining 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros. There is no sure outcome; the results are uncertain.
- Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. This means you will certainly receive 1000 Euros without any risk of loss.

Since the decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome, and Lottery A does not have a sure outcome while Lottery B does, I proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Here, Lottery B provides that sure outcome (1000 Euros), while Lottery A does not. Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries.
- Lottery A offers a gain of 6000 Euros with a 50% probability and a loss of 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. This means it does not guarantee any outcome—it has variable outcomes depending on chance.
- Lottery B guarantees a result of 0 Euros with 100% probability, which qualifies as a sure outcome.

Since the decision reason relies on the presence of a sure outcome, we can extract relevant information. Lottery B has a certain outcome (0 Euros), while Lottery A does not.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
According to the decision reason, it prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Since Lottery B has a sure outcome and Lottery A does not, the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
