1,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences of 65% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering both lotteries, focusing on the potential gains and the probabilities associated with Lottery A, specifically the 1% chance of winning nothing and the difference in probabilities between the 66% and 33% outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers the highest potential gain ""rechnerisch"" (theoretically or mathematically), considering the 1% chance of winning nothing as negligible compared to the potential increase of 100 Euros (approximately 2.5% of the difference between the outcomes).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual. The individual discusses the probabilities and potential gains but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes as the basis for their decision.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is based on the potential for higher gain and the negligible risk of the 1% outcome, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned as a factor in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. Instead, the individual's choice is based on the potential for higher gain and the perceived negligible risk of the lowest-probability outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 34% = 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, so the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, and it indicates that Lottery B has a slightly larger difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries, noting that a win is more probable with Lottery A but the win amount is higher with Lottery B. They also mention the difference between the win amounts being greater than the difference between the probabilities, leading them to conclude that statistically, more money can be won with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they believed it offered a higher potential win statistically, considering the differences in win amounts and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities between the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual discussed differences but focused on the differences between the win amounts rather than the probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the win amounts and their statistical interpretation), it appears that the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's justification is more about the potential win and its probability rather than the difference in probabilities themselves.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's decision was influenced by the difference in potential winnings and their interpretation of statistical outcomes, not the specific rule about probability differences outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of 3000 Euros from Lottery A and the expected value of Lottery B, which they calculated as 4000 Euros * 0.8 = 3200 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual initially leaned towards Lottery A due to its certain gain but ultimately chose Lottery B after recalculating its expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration, as described, focuses on the certain gain of Lottery A and the expected value of Lottery B, without mentioning the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B, but their justification was based on the expected value, not the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the certainty of gain from Lottery A and the expected value calculation of Lottery B, rather than the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 20%, so the difference is 20% - 0% = 20%. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 25%, so the difference is 25% - 0% = 25%. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (20% for A and 25% for B). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the theoretical winnings of each lottery, calculating them as 800 Euros for A and 750 Euros for B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery A because its theoretical winning (800 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (750 Euros). 
The described deliberation process focuses on the expected values or theoretical winnings of the lotteries rather than the probabilities or their differences. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason relies on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities (20% for A and 25% for B), but the individual considered the theoretical winnings (800 Euros for A and 750 Euros for B). 
There is a mismatch between the information the decision reason requires and what the individual considered. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (25% difference), but the individual chose Lottery A based on its higher theoretical winning, not the probability difference. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 10% chance of not winning, which implies 0% chance of the minimum outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (chance of winning 3000 Euros). The difference is 90% - 10% = 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 55% chance of not winning, which implies 0% chance of the minimum outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (chance of winning 6000 Euros). The difference is 45% - 55% = -10%, but since we're looking at the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities in terms of the range of probabilities for winning or not, we consider the actual difference in winning probabilities which is 45% - 0% = 45% for B and 90% - 0% = 90% for A. However, to correctly apply the decision reason as stated, we should calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as stated: For Lottery A, it's 90% - 0% = 90%, and for Lottery B, it's 45% - 0% = 45%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is the difference in the probability ranges for winning in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (rechnerisch um 2700 Euro) of both lotteries and the probability of winning in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a higher probability of winning something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected value and the probability of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (90% difference) over Lottery B (45% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the higher probability of winning something, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities. 

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as stated to make their decision. They focused on the probability of winning and the expected value rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, implying 0.2% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (for 3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, implying 0.1% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for 6000 Euros). Therefore, the difference for Lottery A is 0.2% - 0% = 0.2%, and for Lottery B, it is 0.1% - 0% = 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the total winnings (theoretical gain) of both lotteries, noting they were the same. Additionally, the individual focused on the probability of getting nothing (0 Euros) from each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B was based on the lower probability of getting nothing (0 Euros) with Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the probability of getting nothing and the theoretical gain, not explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual preferred Lottery A because it had a lower probability of yielding nothing, which aligns with preferring a scenario where the difference in probabilities (in this context, implicitly considering the risk of getting nothing) influences the choice, but does not directly match the decision reason's rule about preferring the larger difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. While the individual considered probabilities, the focus was on the risk of getting nothing rather than the difference between the probabilities of outcomes within each lottery. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, and Lottery A has a larger difference than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses of both lotteries, specifically mentioning the loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B and a calculated loss of 3200 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the potential loss is only 3000 Euros, compared to the calculated loss of 3200 Euros in Lottery A. The justification focuses on the magnitude of the loss rather than the probabilities associated with the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences in probabilities between the lotteries, but the individual's consideration was based on the magnitude of potential losses, not the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing the loss amount, not on probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the potential financial losses rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For both lotteries, the minimum probability is 0% (since the 0 Euros outcome has a probability, but in the context of this reason, we're considering the difference between the probabilities of the outcomes, which in a more general interpretation might involve comparing the probabilities of winning/losing or any outcome, but here it seems to directly relate to the probabilities given). The maximum probability for Lottery A is 80% and for Lottery B is 75%. However, interpreting the reason strictly, it seems to be about comparing the range of probabilities within each lottery, which would be 80%-20% = 60% for Lottery A and 75%-25% = 50% for Lottery B. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities within each lottery: 60% for A and 50% for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected loss of each lottery, calculating that Lottery A results in an expected loss of 800 Euros and Lottery B in an expected loss of 750 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it results in a lower expected loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probabilities within each lottery, while the individual considered the expected monetary losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (60% difference), but the individual chose Lottery B based on expected loss, not probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries' outcomes to make the decision. The individual's focus was on expected monetary loss, not on the probability differences as specified by the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (-6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of potential loss in both lotteries and the probability of losing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the lower probability of losing any amount, not directly mentioning the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of the probability of losing any amount. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery A with an 80% difference, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (lower probability of losing). 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification does not align with the rule specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, implying the loss or non-win outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (for -3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for -6000 Euros). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 0.2% - 0% = 0.2%, and for Lottery B, it is 0.1% - 0% = 0.1%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of both lotteries and noticed that the ""Faktor/Divisor"" (factor/divisor) is 2 for both, suggesting a comparison of the probability ratios or the impact of the probabilities. They also considered the absolute loss amount and its psychological impact.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the absolute loss (-3000 Euros) is less, despite being twice as likely, making it less intimidating.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did not directly consider this difference as their primary reason. Instead, they focused on the absolute loss amount and its likelihood.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring the smaller absolute loss despite its higher probability), it seems the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision was based more on the psychological impact of the loss rather than the probability differences between the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the outcome of 1000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (for the outcome of 500 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcome and probability of both lotteries and calculated the product of the gain and probability for each lottery, noting that this product is the same for both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a gain, ensuring they do not leave empty-handed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 50%). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the guarantee of not leaving empty-handed, not on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's a 100% chance of -500 Euros). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 50% - 0% = 50%, and for Lottery B, it's 100% - 100% = 0%. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the potential losses of both lotteries in relation to their current wealth, comparing the impact of losing 1000 Euros in Lottery A to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was that the certain loss of 500 Euros seemed less painful compared to the potential loss of 1000 Euros, given their current wealth of 2000 Euros. The deliberation process focuses on the perceived pain of loss rather than the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) to that considered by the individual (perceived pain of loss and comparison of potential losses), it appears the individual did not directly consider the probabilities' differences as described by the decision reason.
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring the certain, lesser loss due to its perceived lesser pain). The individual's decision seems to be based on loss aversion rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0, since probabilities are often expressed as decimals) and the maximum probability is 25% (or 0.25). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is also 25% (or 0.25) and the maximum probability is 50% (or 0.5). The difference for Lottery A is 0.25 - 0 = 0.25, and for Lottery B is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the statistical expectation (or average win) of both lotteries, noticing they are equal at 1500 Euros. They also considered the probability of winning nothing in both lotteries, noting that the probability of getting nothing is halved in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A is based on the reduced risk of getting nothing (0 Euros), which aligns with a ""play it safe"" strategy.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the expected value and the specific probabilities of winning nothing, rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification is based on minimizing the risk of the worst outcome (getting nothing), which does not directly align with comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for both -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected loss of both lotteries, which they calculated to be the same (rechnerisch 1500 Euro), and the distribution of outcomes, specifically focusing on the probability of not losing anything in Lottery A (drei Vierteln der Fälle nichts verliere).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the higher loss in the quarter of cases where a loss occurs, they preferred the higher probability (three-quarters) of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the expected loss and the specific probabilities of not losing in each lottery, not directly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 50% difference. The individual's justification, however, was based on the preference for a higher chance of not losing anything, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual chose Lottery A, which would be preferred by the decision reason, the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), so the difference is 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: difference = 99.8%
- Lottery B: difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the total expected value (rechnerische Gesamtsumme) of both lotteries and found them to be the same. They were also drawn to the high potential reward of 5000 Euros in Lottery A but saw the 5 Euros in Lottery B as too low to consider, essentially viewing it as ""nearly nothing.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the expected values being equal, the high potential reward of 5000 Euros was more appealing, and the low reward of 5 Euros in Lottery B seemed insignificant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected values and the attractiveness of the potential rewards rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification was based on the appeal of the high reward and the insignificance of the low reward, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The verbal report indicates that the decision was influenced by the perceived value of the rewards rather than the probability differences, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the statistical expectation of both lotteries and the high probability of not losing any money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they bet on the overwhelming probability of not losing any money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the statistical expectation and the high probability of not losing money, which is related to the probabilities but does not directly address the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is based on the high probability of not losing money, not directly on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The justification provided focuses on the high probability of not losing money, which is a different reasoning path. Therefore, while there is a coincidence in the choice made, the reasoning process described does not align with the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the decision reason, we need to consider what it implies: the reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason, as stated, does not provide a clear preference based on the calculated differences. However, it's crucial to understand that the decision reason's applicability hinges on the existence of a difference in probability ranges. In this scenario, since both lotteries have the same effective range (0% difference), the reason might seem inapplicable or indifferent. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries, considering the guaranteed win of 1500 Euros in Lottery A and the potential outcomes of Lottery B, which they calculated would result in zero on average.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed 1500 Euros, whereas Lottery B, when calculated, averages out to zero. The focus is on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the uncertainty and potential for a zero average outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the average expected outcome in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not directly apply. The individual's justification is based on the guarantee of winning in Lottery A versus the potential for a zero average outcome in Lottery B, not on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome and the average expected value, not on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery A and compared it to the expected outcome of Lottery B, which they seem to understand as a ""rechnerischer Gewinn von 0 Euro"" (computational gain of 0 Euros), implying they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because the certain gain of 2000 Euros was more appealing than the expected outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the gain from Lottery A versus the expected outcome of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would not lead to a preference for one over the other based on the given rule. The individual, however, chose Lottery A based on the certainty of the gain, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the appeal of a certain gain over an expected value, not on the probability differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the reason, we need to understand it considers the difference in probabilities within each lottery. Since Lottery A has two different outcomes with equal probabilities, and Lottery B has a single outcome with 100% probability, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived. The reason would prefer the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum probability, but in this case, both lotteries have a difference of 0% because Lottery A's probabilities are equal and Lottery B has only one outcome. Thus, the decision reason, as stated, does not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the given probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries, A and B, and considered the expected outcome of each. They noted that Lottery A results in a net gain of zero (""rechnerisch auf Null"") and that Lottery B results in a guaranteed win (""in jedem Fall"").

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a win, unlike Lottery A which could result in either a gain or a loss but ultimately balances out to zero.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations. The individual focused on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and the balancing effect of Lottery A's outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum probability does not match the individual's justification, which was based on the guarantee of winning in Lottery B versus the balanced outcome of Lottery A.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the guaranteed win in Lottery B and the net outcome of Lottery A, not on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the calculation of these differences for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries (A and B) and noted that the outcomes are ""rechnerisch dieselben,"" which translates to ""computationally the same."" This implies the individual considered the expected values or outcomes of both lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to ""go for risk"" and chose Lottery A. This suggests the individual's decision was influenced by the perception of risk associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was calculated as 0% for both lotteries. The individual, however, considered the computational equivalence of the outcomes and the risk associated with each lottery, not explicitly the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on a willingness to take risk, not the probability difference rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus on the computational equivalence of the outcomes and the willingness to take risk does not reflect the application of the specified decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
