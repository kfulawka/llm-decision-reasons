STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the expected gain of both options, calculating the middle expected win. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (referred to as Option 1) is that it is slightly better than Option 2 (Lottery B), but the specific criteria used for this evaluation are not mentioned.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (expected gain), it appears the individual did not directly consider the probability differences as specified by the decision reason. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the smaller difference in probability) with the individual's justification (Lottery A is slightly better due to expected gain), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on expected gain rather than the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which in this case is Lottery A with a difference of 32%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered both options, looked at the individual probabilities and outcomes multiple times, and calculated the expected gain in their head.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual calculated the middle expected gain and concluded that Option 2 (which we need to identify as either Lottery A or B based on the decision problem description) is slightly better than Option 1.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, which is Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the calculation of the expected gain, not the comparison of probability differences. The verbal report does not explicitly state which option is Option 1 or Option 2, but based on the preference for ""Option 2"" being ""slightly better,"" and assuming the standard presentation where A is the first option, this would imply a preference for Lottery B if following typical presentation structures, which contradicts the decision reason’s preference for Lottery A based on probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 60%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk-free nature of Option 1 (Lottery A) and compared it to Option 2 (Lottery B), noting that Option 2 has a lower average gain and the risk of not winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 1 because it offers a risk-free gain, implying that the avoidance of risk was a key factor in the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the risk-free nature of one option and the risk associated with the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on its risk-free nature, not explicitly on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process did not directly involve calculating or considering the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason suggests. However, the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its smaller probability difference, which is essentially a characteristic of being risk-free) aligns with the individual's choice. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was explicitly used, as it focuses on risk rather than probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The focus was on risk, not probability differences, indicating the decision reason was likely not used as the basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 80% probability implies the remaining 20% is for the winning outcome) and the maximum probability is 20%. The difference is 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (similarly implied) and the maximum probability is 25%. The difference is 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences between the minimum and maximum outcomes for each lottery, which are 20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected gain (erwartbaren Gewinn) of both options, implying they looked at the monetary outcomes and their probabilities to calculate an average or expected outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a slightly higher expected gain compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the expected gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 20% difference. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected gain, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries to make their decision. Instead, they based their choice on the expected gain of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for the 6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (for the 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered both options, compared them multiple times, and calculated the expected gain, finding both lotteries to be of equal value in this regard.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B (referred to as ""Option 2"") due to reasons of risk minimization.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report. The individual considered expected gains and risk minimization.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 10% difference. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing risk minimization as the reason, not the difference in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the decision reason provided (preference for the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's stated justification for choosing Lottery B (risk minimization based on expected gain calculations).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 0.2% and the minimum probability is 0%, resulting in a difference of 0.2%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 0.1% and the minimum probability is 0%, resulting in a difference of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (0.1% vs 0.2%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected gain for both options and found them equal. Additionally, the individual considered the aspect of risk, aiming for a more conservative choice with less risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option that offers a more secure, though potentially smaller, gain, indicating a preference for lower risk over higher potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, while the individual considered expected gain and risk. The individual's consideration does not directly align with the probability differences between the lotteries as specified by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on preferring a more secure option with less risk, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges. The individual chose Lottery A, which contradicts the preference indicated by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery does not align with the individual's considerations of expected gain and risk as described in the verbal report. Furthermore, the individual's choice of Lottery A does not match the preference for Lottery B as suggested by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), so the difference is 0%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which in this case would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected loss for both options, implying they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that Option 2 (Lottery B) has a better expected loss, which is why it was chosen. Note that the individual does not explicitly mention considering the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, but the individual's verbal report does not mention this specific consideration. Instead, the individual focused on the expected loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities (which would be Lottery B), and the individual chose Lottery B but justified it based on expected loss, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery B was based on the calculation of expected loss, not on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as specified by the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the probability differences for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected gain for both options and considered them equivalent. They also considered the risk aspect, describing Option 2 (Lottery B) as ""konservativ-risikoärmer,"" which translates to ""more conservative"" or ""less risky.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it is less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well, since there is only one outcome. However, considering the essence of the reason, it aims to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this context, seems to be more about preferring the lottery with less variability in outcomes due to its certain outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason in this context is the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the variability in Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered that both options have similar expected outcomes but noted that one option (Lottery A) is less risky because it guarantees a small, certain loss compared to a potential larger loss in the other (Lottery B).
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its lower risk, specifically the guarantee of a small loss rather than the possibility of a larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (certainty of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (risk associated with the variability of outcomes), we see there's a conceptual overlap in that the individual is drawn to the certainty of Lottery A's outcome, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for less variability in probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, implying a preference for certainty) to the individual's justification (preferring the certain, though negative, outcome of Lottery A due to its lower risk), it appears the individual's reasoning aligns with the principle of avoiding the higher variability in outcomes present in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the risk associated with the variability of outcomes and the preference for a certain, albeit negative, outcome aligns closely with the decision reason's underlying principle of preferring less variability in probabilities. While the verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities, the concept of risk and certainty reflects an understanding that aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with less variability in outcomes. However, the assessment is not 100 because the individual's justification is more directly related to the risk of outcomes rather than explicitly discussing the difference in probability ranges."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's a 75% chance of 0 Euros, but we consider the explicit probabilities given) or 25% (the lowest explicit probability given for a non-zero outcome) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). However, for the purpose of this reason, we consider the probabilities associated with the monetary outcomes, thus the minimum is 25% and the maximum is 75%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between these probabilities for each lottery: 
- For Lottery A, the difference is 75% - 25% = 50%.
- For Lottery B, the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.
Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected gains of both options and considered them equivalent. They then chose Option 2 (Lottery B) because it offers a ""sichereren und niedrigeren Gewinn,"" which translates to ""safer and lower gain.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the perceived safety and the lower gain of the chosen option, not explicitly on the probabilities' differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected gains and the safety of the options.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which aligns with choosing Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the safety and lower gain, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (choosing Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's focus on probability differences. The individual's justification is based on different criteria (expected gain and safety), suggesting that the decision reason might not have been the basis for the choice.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: While the decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its smaller probability difference (which equates to less risk in terms of probability variability), the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on it being ""konservativ-risikoärmer"" (more conservative and less risky), which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason but does not directly reflect the reason's specific consideration of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision to choose Lottery B aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The justification provided (conservative and less risky) could be related to many aspects of the lotteries, not just the probability differences. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome, the process described does not clearly match the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), so the difference is 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, making the difference 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery B has a difference of 99.8%, and Lottery A has a difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the average expected loss for both options and considered them equal in this regard. They also considered the risk aspect, specifically looking for a ""konservativ-risikoärmer"" (more conservative, less risky) option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 1 (which corresponds to Lottery A, as it is the one with a fixed, certain outcome) because it is more conservative and less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected loss and the risk aspect, not the probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on its conservative and less risky nature, not explicitly on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The report does not mention considering the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are both 0%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected gain of both options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Option 2 (Lottery B) to be clearly better, indicating a preference for the certain gain over the uncertain outcomes of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual preferred Lottery B based on expected gain, not the probability difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that one option (Lottery A) offers a certain gain, while the other option (Lottery B) offers no gain on average.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the certainty of gain in one option versus the average outcome of the other.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the certainty of gain and average outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would lead to indifference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the certainty of gain and average outcomes, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus was on the certainty of gain and average outcomes, suggesting that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences, we should note that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the reason's rule implies looking for the smallest difference, which in this context would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the calculated differences alone. However, the key information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) can indeed be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Option 2 (Lottery B) and the lack of a guaranteed gain in Option 1 (Lottery A), noting that Option 1 has no guaranteed win and implies a risk of losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Option 2 because it offers a ""small secure gain"" and criticizes Option 1 for having ""no gain on average.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of gain and the average outcome, not the probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which does not align with the individual's justification that emphasizes the certainty of a small gain over the risk of no gain or loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus is on the certainty of gain and average outcomes rather than the probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the probability differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with each option, noting that Lottery A (referred to as Option 1) offers no risk with a guaranteed outcome of 0 Euros, while Lottery B (referred to as Option 2) has an equal chance of winning or losing but ultimately offers no average gain.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A due to reasons of risk minimization, preferring the option that offers no risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the presence or absence of risk rather than the probability ranges.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Although both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the individual's justification was based on risk minimization, not explicitly on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on risk minimization and the absence of risk in one of the options, rather than on the specific rule about probability differences.
