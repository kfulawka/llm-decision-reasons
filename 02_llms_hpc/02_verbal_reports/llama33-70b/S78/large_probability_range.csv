STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% for one outcome, so the difference is 100% - 100% = 0% (since there's only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 65% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the differences in winnings (Gewinndifferenzen) and the risk of losing everything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the differences in winnings for Lottery A were not large enough to justify the risk of losing everything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the differences in winnings and the risk of losing. These are related but distinct, as the individual's consideration is more about the outcomes and their associated risks rather than the probabilities themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing (implied to be Lottery B, based on the context of risk aversion regarding the ""Risiko alles zu verlieren"" - risk of losing everything) does not directly mention the probability differences but rather the risk and reward balance.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the specific rule of the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) when making their choice. Instead, their justification focuses on the risk and reward aspects, which aligns more with a risk aversion strategy rather than the specific probability difference rule outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
2,"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as the probability of not winning is 66%) and the maximum probability is 34% (probability of winning 2400 Euros), so the difference is 34%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicit, as the probability of not winning is 67%) and the maximum probability is 33% (probability of winning 2500 Euros), so the difference is 33%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the risks and gains of both lotteries. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was that the probability of winning was relatively low for both, but the potential gain was higher in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (risks and gains, specifically the potential gain and the fact that probabilities were relatively low), there is no direct mention of comparing the differences in probabilities between the two lotteries. The individual's justification focuses on the potential gain and the general awareness of low probabilities, not the specific difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (focusing on the potential gain and relative probability levels).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery A and implies a consideration of risk, mentioning that the risk is not worth it when there's a 100% chance of winning with Lottery A. This suggests the individual is focused on the certainty of the outcome rather than the difference in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the risk associated with Lottery B (implied by the possibility of not winning) is not worth taking when Lottery A offers a guaranteed win. The justification centers around the concept of risk and certainty rather than the specific probability ranges of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, not on the probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the preference for a guaranteed win over a risky option, not on the comparison of probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report indicates a focus on risk aversion and the value of certainty, rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 25%, so the difference is 25%. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 20%, so the difference is 20%. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
The individual considered the difference in probability to win (5% less for B) and the difference in the amount to be won (25% higher for B). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual seems to focus on the trade-off between the probability and the amount to be won, but the exact justification is not clearly stated. 
However, the individual mentions the probability and the amount, which are relevant to the lotteries. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason requires the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual considered the difference in probability to win and the difference in the amount to be won. 
The individual does not explicitly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probability. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but the individual’s justification is based on a different comparison (probability to win and amount to be won). 
Based on these two comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 45% (or 6000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (or 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 90%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as a significant factor, viewing it as ""sehr sicher"" (very secure).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its high probability of winning, which they perceived as making it a very secure option. The deliberation process described focuses on the perceived security of Lottery B due to its high winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's verbal report focuses on the high probability of winning in Lottery B, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 90% difference. The individual chose Lottery B but justified it based on its high probability of winning, not the difference in probabilities between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the high probability of Lottery B aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that winning options were unlikely but noted the potential gain in Lottery A was higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential gain when the outcome is favorable, acknowledging the low probability of winning in both options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the potential gain and the unlikelihood of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery A in this case (99.8% vs 99.6%). However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries but rather compares the potential gains.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% (with an implicit 0% for any other outcome), so the difference is 100%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual calculates 20% of 3000 Euros, which equals 600 Euros, and mentions the loss in Lottery A would have occurred with a 20% probability, comparing it to a 33% higher risk. This suggests the individual is considering the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, specifically focusing on the risk associated with the potential loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds Lottery B more attractive due to the comparison of risks and potential losses, implying a preference based on the perceived risk and its associated probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences in probabilities (60% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B), but the individual's focus is on the risk comparison and not explicitly on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of Lottery B due to a comparison of risks and not explicitly because of the difference in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the focus is on risk comparison rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for the -4000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 80% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the -3000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of a loss being 5% higher and the loss being 25% lower. This implies the individual looked at the probabilities and the magnitude of the losses in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparative risks and losses, noting a trade-off between a slightly higher risk of loss in one lottery and a significantly lower loss amount in that same lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the comparative risks (which could relate to probabilities) and the magnitude of losses, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or consideration of the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention this rule or any direct comparison of probability ranges between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The verbal report does not directly mention considering the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), so the difference is 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), so the difference is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual considered the ""Verlustpotenzial"" (loss potential) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual preferred Lottery A because it had the ""geringere Verlustpotenzial"" (lower loss potential).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the loss potential of the lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the lower loss potential. 
Based on these two comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the individual's justification is based on loss potential rather than the difference in probability ranges.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0% (100% - 100%).
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 50% (50% - 0%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions wanting to compensate for a previous loss with a safe decision, indicating they considered the aspect of safety or certainty in their choice.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about making a safe decision to compensate for a previous loss, which implies the individual prioritized certainty over potential higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the lotteries, while the individual considered the safety of the decision, which aligns with choosing the lottery with a 100% certain outcome but does not directly mention comparing probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing a safe decision aligns more with choosing Lottery A, as it offers a certain outcome, but this does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (for the outcome of 0 Euros, which doesn't apply directly but implies a 50% chance of not losing anything) and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. However, correctly interpreting the minimum and maximum probabilities for Lottery B in the context of the decision reason, we should consider the probabilities associated with the actual outcomes: -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Thus, the difference for Lottery B should be considered as the range between the probabilities of its outcomes, which is 50% - 50% = 0%, since both outcomes have the same probability. But to apply the decision reason as stated, we look for the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning or losing, which might be misunderstood in the explanation. The correct application should consider the range of probabilities for outcomes, which in this case does not directly apply as intended because both lotteries have fixed probabilities for their outcomes. However, for clarity and to proceed: Lottery A has a fixed outcome, and Lottery B has two outcomes with equal probabilities. The decision reason, as stated, seems to misunderstand the concept of minimum and maximum probabilities in this context. Yet, to proceed with the assessment as per the instructions, we acknowledge the decision reason can technically be applied but might not align well with standard probability assessments.

The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0% (since there's only one outcome)
- Lottery B: Difference = 0% (since both outcomes have the same probability)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered avoiding a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it was the only option to avoid a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which doesn't directly align with the individual's focus on avoiding a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which doesn't match the individual's justification of choosing Lottery B to avoid a loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on avoiding a loss, not on comparing the range of probabilities between the lotteries.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for both 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%, making the difference 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%, making the difference 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that in Lottery A, the chance to win something at all is higher. This implies the individual considered the probabilities of winning any amount in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by noting the higher chance of winning something in Lottery A, without explicitly mentioning the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the chance of winning something, which relates to the probabilities but does not directly address the decision reason’s specific comparison.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (50% difference vs. 25% difference). However, the individual's justification does not indicate a consideration of these differences but rather the overall chance of winning something, which is higher in Lottery A due to having two winning outcomes with probabilities adding up to 50%.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the specific rule of the decision reason (comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries) when making their choice.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 75% - 25% = 50%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""B bot die größere Chancen einen Verlust zu umgehen,"" which translates to ""B has a greater chance of avoiding a loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss in each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify the choice based on the chance of avoiding a loss, implying they considered how likely it is to not incur a loss in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the chance of avoiding a loss, which relates to the probabilities but not directly to the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on avoiding a loss, not directly on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Instead, the focus was on avoiding a loss, which, while related to probabilities, does not align with the specific rule of the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), making the difference 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery B, since the probability is 100% for the single outcome, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), making the difference 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 99.8%
- Lottery B: Difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain from Lottery B as not worthwhile because 5 Euros would not have made a significant difference, implying they valued the potential higher reward of Lottery A over the certainty of a small gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because the potential higher reward of Lottery A was worth the greater risk, compared to the minimal gain offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration was more about the perceived value and risk of the outcomes rather than explicitly calculating or comparing probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A, but their justification was based on the potential reward being worth the risk, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason provided, as their focus was more on the value and risk assessment rather than the specific probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), making the difference 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery A, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), making the difference 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report states, ""Auf die 5 Euro kommt es nicht an,"" which translates to ""The 5 Euros don't matter."" This suggests the individual considered the monetary outcomes but concluded that the specific amount of 5 Euros was not a decisive factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice based on the probabilities or the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. It only mentions the irrelevance of the 5 Euros, without addressing the probability aspects directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was 99.8% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A. The individual's consideration, as stated, does not explicitly mention probabilities or their differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on the monetary outcome being irrelevant, not on the probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the difference in probability ranges as their decision criterion, nor did they justify their choice based on this rule. The verbal report lacks direct reference to the probabilities or their differences as the basis for the decision.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for both winning and losing) and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there is no chance of losing) and the maximum probability is 100% (for winning), resulting in a difference of 100%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and losing in Lottery A to be equal and noted that Lottery B was only profitable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the equal chances of winning and losing in Lottery A and the guaranteed profit in Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the equality of probabilities in Lottery A and the guaranteed win in Lottery B, not explicitly discussing the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating this rule, does highlight the guaranteed nature of Lottery B, which could implicitly suggest a preference for its certainty over the uncertainty of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because the verbal report does not explicitly mention the decision reason's key factor—the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual's preference for the guaranteed win in Lottery B aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the consideration of probability ranges as specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for losing) and the maximum probability is 50% (for winning), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's no chance of losing) and the maximum probability is 100% (for winning), resulting in a difference of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 0% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the probabilities of winning and losing in each lottery. The individual notes that in Lottery A, the probability of winning and losing is equally high (50%), and in Lottery B, the win is guaranteed (100% probability). The individual's justification for the choice is not explicitly stated in terms of preferring one lottery over the other based on these probabilities, but it highlights the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (the equality of winning and losing probabilities in Lottery A and the guarantee of winning in Lottery B), it appears the individual is aware of the probability structures of both lotteries. However, the decision reason specifically looks at the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities to make a preference, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of the win in Lottery B rather than the difference in probability ranges between the lotteries. Therefore, while the individual considers probabilities, the specific rule of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) is not clearly applied in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for the decision. The focus is more on the guaranteed outcome of one lottery rather than the probability range difference."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. However, the decision reason can still be conceptually applied, as it's about comparing these differences. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 0% difference (100% - 100%)
- Lottery B: 0% difference (50% - 50%)
Given the nature of the lotteries, the decision reason's premise (comparing differences in probability ranges) doesn't directly apply in a meaningful way since both lotteries have the same effective range (0%) due to their specific structures. However, we proceed to analyze the verbal report to understand the individual's thought process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery A appears to bring a win in every case, implying they considered the certainty of the outcome. For Lottery B, they note it has equal parts risk and chance, indicating an awareness of the balanced probability of gain or loss.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the balanced risk and chance of Lottery B, without explicitly discussing the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which the individual does not explicitly mention in their justification.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not directly apply. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of winning in Lottery A versus the risk and chance balance in Lottery B, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus is on the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A and the risk/chance balance for Lottery B, without mentioning or implying consideration of the probability differences as defined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are both 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""kein Risiko"" (no risk), implying they looked at the potential for loss or gain without specifying probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered ""nichts zu verlieren"" (nothing to lose), indicating a focus on avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability differences) with that considered by the individual (risk and potential loss), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the probability differences between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk by choosing the option with nothing to lose), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%, and the individual's focus was on avoiding loss rather than comparing probability differences.
