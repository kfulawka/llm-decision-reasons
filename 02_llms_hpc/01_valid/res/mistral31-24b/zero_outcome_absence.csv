0,"Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires identifying the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Lottery A has a zero outcome with 1% probability.
Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
According to the decision reason, we should prefer the lottery without a zero outcome. Since Lottery B does not have a zero outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
1,"6% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. Both lotteries have a zero outcome:
- Lottery A has a 67% probability of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 66% probability of 0 Euros.
Since both lotteries have a zero outcome, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. However, both lotteries have a zero outcome, so the decision reason cannot prefer one lottery over the other.

9,"reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. Both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome. Therefore, the decision reason cannot be applied strictly to differentiate between the two lotteries. As the information required for a strict application of the decision reason is not sufficient to make a decision, the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.
