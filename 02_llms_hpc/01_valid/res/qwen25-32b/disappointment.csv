assistant
STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
   - For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 2400 Euros since it guarantees this amount.
   - The relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
   - Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery:
     - Lottery A: 2500 Euros - 0 Euros = 2500 Euros
     - Lottery B: 2400 Euros - 2400 Euros = 0 Euros
   - According to the decision reason, it prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
