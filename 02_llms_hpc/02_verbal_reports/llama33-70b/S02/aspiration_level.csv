STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. To calculate the aspiration level, we consider all unique outcomes from both lotteries: 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 2500 Euros. The aspiration level is (0 + 2400 + 2500) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery B, the differences are (2500 - 1633.33), (2400 - 1633.33), and (0 - 1633.33). For Lottery A, the difference is (2400 - 1633.33). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can now proceed to analyze the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the absence of losses in Lottery B, the low probability of 0 Euros, and the possibility of gaining 100 Euros (implied by the difference between 2500 Euros and 2400 Euros). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of 0 Euros is very low and the potential gain (100 Euros) is not entirely unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. Instead, they focus on the absence of losses, the low probability of the worst outcome, and the potential for a small gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the low probability of the worst outcome and the potential for a gain, not explicitly on the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The focus on the absence of losses, low probability of the worst outcome, and potential gain does not align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros, 0 Euros, 2500 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2400 + 0 + 2500 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175 Euros) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros), while Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275 Euros) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sizes of the lotteries (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1 percentage point) and found both to be not too large.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risk-loving option), implying they preferred the option with potentially higher reward despite its slightly lower probability of winning, due to the small differences in both outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the size of the monetary difference and the probability difference between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its slightly higher probability of winning (34% vs 33%). However, the individual's justification for choosing the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" suggests they were attracted to the higher potential reward of Lottery B despite its slightly lower winning probability, not directly aligning with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's justification is more aligned with a risk preference rather than a detailed analysis of outcome probabilities in relation to an aspiration level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 0 Euros, and 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67, 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33, and 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Lottery A has a 100% probability of a positive difference (666.67), and Lottery B has an 80% probability of a positive difference (1666.67) and a 20% probability of a negative difference (-2333.33). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the safety aspect (Sicherheitsbedürfnis) and the feeling of not wanting to risk losing with the 20% chance of no gain in Lottery B, especially since the amounts are relatively high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the desire for safety and not wanting to gamble with the high amounts, implying a focus on avoiding the potential loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's considerations, as described, focus on safety and avoiding potential loss, which can be related to the concept of positive differences but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A in this case because it guarantees a positive difference from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on a desire for safety and avoiding risk, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome over a risky one but does not directly mention the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on safety and avoiding potential loss, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with more certain positive outcomes. However, the report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the preference for the safer option, the direct application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 3500 / 4 = 1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We need to calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery.
- For Lottery B, the positive difference (2250) occurs with 20% probability, and the negative difference (-1750) occurs with 80% probability.
- For Lottery A, the positive difference (1250) occurs with 25% probability, and the negative difference (-1750) occurs with 75% probability.
Thus, Lottery B has a 20% chance of a positive difference, and Lottery A has a 25% chance of a positive difference. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions being attracted to Lottery B due to the potentially higher gain, acknowledging that the 5% difference in probability does not seem significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice by comparing the potential gains and the probability difference between the two lotteries, focusing on the higher potential gain of Lottery B and downplaying the significance of the 5% probability difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences between outcomes and this aspiration level. The individual, however, focuses on the potential gains and the probability difference without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A (25% vs. 20%). The individual, however, seems to be attracted to Lottery B due to its higher potential gain, not explicitly because of the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's justification is based on the potential gain and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning (90%) in Lottery A as very enticing and found the lower probability of winning in Lottery B (45%) unappealing. They also compared the potential winnings, noting that the higher potential win in Lottery B was not enough to outweigh the lower probability of winning.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by emphasizing the attractiveness of the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the unattractiveness of the low winning probability in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as described, focus on the probabilities of winning and the comparison of potential winnings but do not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery A due to its higher winning probability and finds the potential higher win in Lottery B less attractive due to its lower probability, which indirectly aligns with preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (in this context, winning something rather than nothing).

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations outlined in the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences). However, the emphasis on the probability of winning and the comparative attractiveness of the lotteries based on their probabilities and outcomes suggests some indirect alignment with the concept of preferring outcomes based on their likelihood of being positive (or desirable).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as defined, given the lack of explicit mention or calculation of an aspiration level and the focus on probabilities of winning rather than differences from an aspiration level. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's emphasis on probabilities and comparative attractiveness of outcomes suggests some intuitive alignment with preferring outcomes based on their desirability and likelihood, which is a component of the decision reason's underlying logic."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level = (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 9000 / 4 = 2250 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 2250 = 750 (positive), 0 - 2250 = -2250 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 6000 - 2250 = 3750 (positive), 0 - 2250 = -2250 (negative)
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 
Given the lotteries' probabilities:
- Lottery A has a 0.2% chance of a positive difference and a 99.8% chance of a negative difference.
- Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference.
This step shows that the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive and negative differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions that the probability of winning is very low (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Gewinns sowieso verschwindend gering""), which implies they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual feels that because the probability of winning is very low, it's relatively unimportant (""relativ egal""), and thus they can opt for the higher win (""den höheren Gewinn setzen kann""). This indicates the individual considered the magnitude of the potential wins in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences. The individual considered the low probability of winning and the magnitude of the wins but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual opted for the higher win because the low probability made the choice seem less significant, which indirectly aligns with preferring a higher potential win but does not directly address the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations of the decision reason, particularly in calculating an aspiration level and explicitly comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual's focus on the magnitude of the win in the context of very low probabilities shares a superficial similarity with the decision reason's preference for higher outcomes, albeit without the explicit consideration of probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there's a slight alignment in the preference for higher outcomes, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not closely follow the specific considerations and calculations outlined in the decision reason."
7,"lust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: Outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- Lottery A: Outcome is -3000 Euros.
The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -4000, 0, and -3000, which equals (-4000 + 0 + -3000) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33.
- For Lottery A: -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the positive difference (2333.33) occurs with 20% probability, and in Lottery A, there are no positive differences since all outcomes are below the aspiration level.
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the definitive loss in both lotteries and weighed the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B against the higher loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by stating that the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B did not justify the additional 1000 Euros loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on a comparison of the potential losses and the probability of avoiding loss, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or positive differences from it.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on a direct comparison of potential losses and the value of avoiding a loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -4000 Euros, the difference is -4000 - (-1750) = -2250; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-1750) = -1250; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750. Since the reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, we need to calculate these probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery B, the positive difference occurs with 80% probability (since 0 Euros is a positive difference from the aspiration level), and for Lottery A, it occurs with 75% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and suggests preferring Lottery B due to its higher probability of a positive difference from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the influence of the 5% difference (which likely refers to the difference in probabilities of losing between the two lotteries) and being influenced by the ""kleinere Verlustsumme"" (smaller loss sum), implying they considered the amounts of potential losses and possibly their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the smaller loss sum, possibly because the larger loss amount (4000 Euros) seemed too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above such a level. Instead, they focus on the difference in potential losses and the impact of these losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would be Lottery B based on the calculation. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (based on the smaller loss sum) does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it does not consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The focus on the ""kleinere Verlustsumme"" and the perceived high loss of 4000 Euros does not align with the decision reason's specific process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 2250 with a probability of 55% for Lottery A (since the 0 Euros outcome is considered a positive difference from the aspiration level) and 10% for Lottery B (since the 0 Euros outcome is the one that provides a positive difference). However, the calculation of probabilities of positive differences needs to consider the actual probabilities of outcomes that are better than the aspiration level. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) is 55%, and for Lottery B, it's 10%. The decision reason can be applied by comparing these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual initially looked at the outcomes, then felt great uncertainty because Lottery B, although offering a lower loss, had a high probability of that loss occurring. The individual focused on the probability of the loss in Lottery B but also considered the fact that the probability of loss in Lottery A was less than 50%.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after lengthy hesitation because the probability of the negative outcome was under 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification was based on the probability of the loss being under 50% for Lottery A, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s focus on probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process and justification do not directly reflect the application of the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the absolute probabilities of losses rather than on the concept of an aspiration level and differences from it.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities of positive differences are 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as frightening and mentions that the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries is minimal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by emphasizing the fear of the large loss in Lottery A and downplaying the difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the possible loss and the minimal difference in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which is not the focus of the individual’s justification. The individual is more concerned with the fear of the large loss.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. However, the individual's focus on the possible loss and the minimal difference in probabilities might be indirectly related to the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is uncertain.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros (no difference). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities are given, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the attractiveness of getting ""sicher Geld"" (secure money), implying a preference for a certain outcome over a risky one. The individual also mentions that the additional credit did not make them more risk-tolerant.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds the secure money more attractive, especially in comparison to previous lotteries with losses in both options. This suggests that avoiding losses and securing a gain is a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of secure money and avoidance of losses does not directly mention aspiration levels or the calculation of differences from such a level. However, the desire for secure money could indirectly relate to preferring outcomes that are at or above a certain aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the secure money, which aligns with preferring outcomes that do not fall below a certain level (in this case, receiving some money is better than the risk of receiving none). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, while there are some indirect hints that the individual might be considering aspects related to the decision reason (such as preferring secure outcomes), the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 + (-500)) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery A, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (500) is 50%, and in Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0) is 0% since the difference is 0, which is not considered positive. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional funds, possibly making them more risk-seeking (translated from ""risikofreudigere Variante B genommen""). They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the potential for not having a total loss and possibly by a risk-seeking attitude when considering additional funds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level. Instead, they discuss risk attitudes and the unattractiveness of a certain loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification does not explicitly align with this rule, focusing more on the avoidance of certain loss and a possible risk-seeking attitude.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. Their considerations and justifications for the choice do not align with the decision reason's specific criteria, suggesting that this particular reason was not the basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 (positive) and 0 - 2000 = -2000 (negative); for Lottery B, 4000 - 2000 = 2000 (positive), 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000 (negative). The reason considers these differences important and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something and the comparison between the two lotteries in terms of this probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning something was higher, despite the potential gains being lower than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the probability of winning something, which aligns with the concept of positive differences but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, and the individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher probability of winning something, which can be interpreted as a positive difference from not winning (0 Euros).

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process shares some elements with the decision reason, particularly in preferring the lottery with a higher chance of a positive outcome. However, the explicit calculation of an aspiration level and comparison of differences from it, as required by the decision reason, are not mentioned in the verbal report.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being uncertain and being deterred by the high loss value of 6000 Euros in Lottery A. They also acknowledge that losses make decisions harder for them than gains and note that Lottery B has a higher probability of resulting in a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around their aversion to losses, especially the high loss in Lottery A, and the higher probability of any loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on their aversion to losses and the specific high loss value in Lottery A, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level does not directly align with the individual's justification, which centers on loss aversion and the specific outcomes of the lotteries rather than the calculated aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 = -1666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 = 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 = -1671.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B offers a positive difference with a probability of 0.1% and a negative difference with a probability of 99.9%, while Lottery A offers a negative difference with a probability of 100%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of choosing the riskier option (Lottery B), the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B, and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the probability of the large gain in Lottery B was too small to be attractive, despite the potential for a large win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the small probability of the large gain and the certainty of the smaller gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences from an aspiration level but does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B due to its potential for a large gain, albeit with a very low probability. The individual, however, chose Lottery A, citing the unattractiveness of the low probability of the large gain in Lottery B, which aligns with preferring a certain, though smaller, gain over a highly uncertain larger one. This suggests the individual did not follow the decision reason’s rule as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason provided, especially since the aspiration level and its direct influence on the choice are not mentioned. The focus on the probability of the large gain and its unattractiveness due to its low probability suggests a different rationale for the decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used, but there is a slight possibility of some indirect influence, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -1666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5 - (-1666.67) = 1661.67; for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1666.67) = -3333.33 and 0 - (-1666.67) = 1666.67. These differences can be used to evaluate the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the extremely low probability of loss in Lottery B and compared it to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, finding the latter to be relatively insignificant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around the comparison of the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B to the certain but minor loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the magnitude of the potential loss in Lottery B is overshadowed by its low probability, making the certain loss in Lottery A seem insignificant by comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual, however, discusses the probability of loss and the magnitude of potential losses, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is centered on the perceived insignificance of the certain loss in Lottery A compared to the low-probability significant loss in Lottery B, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of differences from such a level in their decision-making process. Instead, the focus is on the comparison of the certain loss in Lottery A to the low-probability loss in Lottery B, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, the relevant information is the probability of getting a positive difference for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the risk of losing 50% of the time in one lottery and prefers the smaller, certain gain. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by stating that the risk of losing in the other lottery is too high and prefers the smaller, certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual seems to focus on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain. The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would require calculating the aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes being above this level. The individual, however, justifies the choice based on risk aversion and preference for certainty, not explicitly mentioning the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as described in the decision reason. The focus on risk and certainty of gain does not align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 0 = 3000, -3000 - 0 = -3000, and 2000 - 0 = 2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can derive this information from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the appeal of a definitive win, especially after many loss decisions in previous rounds, and expresses no desire to play with more risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice based on the desire for a definitive win and the avoidance of risk, given past losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the appeal of a definitive win and risk avoidance, without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B since it guarantees a positive outcome (2000 Euros) with 100% probability. The individual's justification, while emphasizing the desire for a definitive win (which aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome like Lottery B's), does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of outcomes being above this level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on a definitive win and risk avoidance after previous losses aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B for its guaranteed positive outcome), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly considered the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. Thus, while there's a superficial alignment in the choice made, the underlying reasoning process described does not clearly match the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (1000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 Euros and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the difference is always positive. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 50%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain in Lottery A compared to the possible loss in Lottery B, taking into account the probability of the gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by stating that the gain in Lottery A is more attractive than the possible three times higher loss in Lottery B, especially since the probability of gain in Lottery B is only 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the attractiveness of gains and losses and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A because its gain is more attractive compared to the potential loss in Lottery B, considering the 50% probability of gain in B. The individual's reasoning aligns with preferring a certain gain over a risky option with potential for higher loss, which indirectly reflects considering the probability of positive outcomes but does not directly mention the aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the specific calculations and rules outlined in the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. However, the individual's preference for a certain gain over a risky option with a potential for higher loss, considering probabilities, shows a vague alignment with the spirit of risk aversion implied by the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some indirect alignment, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 0 Euros for Lottery A. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the amount of 6000 Euros to be too large to risk, implying they are concerned about the potential loss. They also mention that taking a ""Pause"" (which can be interpreted as not risking or choosing the certain outcome) seems acceptable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing caution towards risking a large sum, suggesting a preference for avoiding potential significant losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's concern is about risking a large sum, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences from a reference point (in this case, not explicitly stated as the aspiration level but can be inferred as related to their personal risk tolerance or reference point).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification suggests a preference for avoiding risk, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A (0 Euros with 100% probability), as it avoids any risk of loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on risk aversion and avoiding large potential losses, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The decision reason would suggest preferring Lottery B due to its positive outcome being above the aspiration level, but the individual's justification suggests they prioritize avoiding risk, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
