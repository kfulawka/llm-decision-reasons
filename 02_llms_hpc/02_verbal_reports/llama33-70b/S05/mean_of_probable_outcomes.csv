STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is probable since 100% is greater than 1/1 or 100%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 2400 Euros with 66% probability and 2500 Euros with 33% probability. The average of these probable outcomes is (2400 * 0.66 + 2500 * 0.33) / (0.66 + 0.33) = (1584 + 825) / 0.99 = 2409 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the only outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability, making its average probable outcome 2400 Euros.
Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because its average of probable outcomes (2409 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low loss possibility (1%) in Lottery A and the 100% gain possibility in Lottery B. They also noted that Lottery A offers a 33% chance of a significantly higher gain, which they preferred in relation to the low risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the low risk of loss in Lottery A against the potential for a higher gain, finding the latter more preferable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating probabilities and outcomes. The individual considered probabilities (1% loss, 100% gain, and a 33% higher gain possibility) but did not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery A due to its potential for a higher gain despite a small risk, which aligns with preferring higher outcomes but does not explicitly mention averaging probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's consideration of probabilities and the preference for a higher potential gain aligns somewhat with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, leading to an assessment below the midpoint but not at the lowest level of certainty that the reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a 33% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 67% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a 34% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 66% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The information relevant to the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. Since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable for both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes for both Lottery A and Lottery B is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (100 Euros more for Lottery A) and the difference in the probability of winning (1% less for Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the higher potential gain of Lottery A and its slightly lower probability of winning compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, considered the difference in potential winnings and the difference in probabilities, not directly the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, seems to make a choice based on a trade-off between potential winnings and probabilities, not based on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's consideration and justification do not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The decision reason's criteria lead to indifference between the two lotteries, but the individual's decision process, as described, does not reflect this indifference or the specific calculation of average probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. The outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Only the 4000 Euros outcome is probable. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. The outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability, which is probable. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their calculation: for Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain from Lottery B and the potential higher gain from Lottery A, along with its uncertainty. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the certain gain from Lottery B was worth more to them than the potential for an additional 1000 Euros from Lottery A, implying a consideration of the trade-off between certainty and potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 4000 Euros and for Lottery B is 3000 Euros. The individual considered the certainty of the gain and the potential higher gain, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the certainty of the gain as the reason, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule that prefers the higher average probable outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both is 0 Euros. However, we need to consider how the decision reason would apply given this calculation doesn't directly lead to a preference based on the stated rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""fast gleiche Warscheinlichkeit"" which translates to ""almost the same probability"" and ""höhrere Gewinnmöglichkeit in B"" which translates to ""higher winning possibility in B"". They also mention ""ohne Risiko jeweils"" which translates to ""without risk respectively"" or ""each without risk"", but this part seems to be somewhat unclear or possibly a misunderstanding since both lotteries involve risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the comparison of probabilities and the potential for higher gain in Lottery B, but the mention of ""without risk"" is confusing in this context since both options carry risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on probabilities higher than 50%. The individual discusses probabilities and the potential for higher gain but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes based on the 50% threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which doesn't seem to directly align with the individual's justification that focuses on the comparison of winning possibilities and an unclear mention of risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the decision reason that involves calculating the average of probable outcomes (where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 50%) to make their decision.

Verbal report:
Lotterie A bot mit 95% eine 40% höhrere (fast sichere) Gewinnwrslkeit

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers outcomes as probable if their probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%.

For Lottery A:
- 3000 Euros with 90% probability: This outcome is probable because 90% > 50%.
- 0 Euros with 10% probability: This outcome is not probable because 10% < 50%.

For Lottery B:
- 6000 Euros with 45% probability: This outcome is not probable because 45% < 50%.
- 0 Euros with 55% probability: This outcome is probable because 55% > 50%.

The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is probable).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""Lotterie A"" and discusses a ""40% höhrere (fast sichere) Gewinnwrslkeit,"" which translates to ""40% higher (almost certain) chance of winning."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A, mentioning it as ""fast sichere,"" which implies a nearly certain win, aligning with the high probability of the 3000 Euros outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its higher average probable outcome (3000 Euros vs. 0 Euros). The individual's consideration of the higher probability of winning in Lottery A aligns with the aspect of identifying probable outcomes but does not directly mention calculating an average of these outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification emphasizes the higher and more certain chance of winning with Lottery A, which indirectly supports the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but does not explicitly state this calculation.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process shares similarities with the decision reason, particularly in preferring Lottery A due to its higher probability of a positive outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating the average of probable outcomes as the basis for the decision. Thus, while there's a alignment in the preference for Lottery A, the exact reasoning process of calculating the average of probable outcomes is not clearly articulated.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). However, in this case, neither of the winning probabilities (0.1% for Lottery B and 0.2% for Lottery A) meets this criterion, as both are less than 0.5. Since the decision reason specifically looks at the average of probable outcomes and both lotteries have outcomes with probabilities below the threshold, we need to consider how the reason would handle this scenario. Given the low probabilities, it seems the decision reason as stated would not directly apply in a straightforward manner because neither outcome in either lottery is considered ""probable"" under the given definition. However, we can still analyze the information relevant to the decision reason: the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes the very low chance of winning in both lotteries, with Lottery A having a slightly higher chance of winning (0.2%) compared to Lottery B (0.1%), but Lottery B offers twice the potential winnings. The individual also mentions that the loss possibility is the same for both (implied as 0 Euros with high probability). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because, despite both lotteries having very low chances of winning, Lottery B offers double the potential winnings of Lottery A, making it preferable given the similarly low risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages, but since neither lottery has outcomes with probabilities above 0.5, the direct application is challenging. The individual, however, considers the probabilities and the potential winnings, which are related but not exactly aligned with focusing solely on ""probable"" outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since neither outcome is probable, this doesn't directly apply. The individual's justification is based on the comparison of potential winnings given the very low probabilities of winning, which indirectly relates to the concept of evaluating outcomes but does not follow the specific rule of averaging probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages, primarily because neither lottery has an outcome that meets the probability threshold for being considered ""probable."" The individual's justification is more about comparing the potential winnings given the low probabilities, which is a different approach. Thus, while there's a vague connection in considering outcomes and their probabilities, the specific decision reason provided does not seem to be the basis for the individual's choice."

Verbal report:
geringerer Verlust wurde bei beinaher gleicher Wrlkeit (20% weniger in B) wahrgenommen

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. The outcomes are -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Since 80% is greater than 50%, -4000 Euros is a probable outcome for Lottery B. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, -3000 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is -4000 Euros (since only the -4000 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold), and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""geringerer Verlust"" which translates to ""lower loss"" and compares the probabilities, noting ""beinaher gleicher Wrlkeit"" which translates to ""nearly the same probability"" but then specifies ""20% weniger in B"" which means ""20% less in B"". This indicates the individual considered the losses and the probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the perceived lower loss and the comparison of probabilities, suggesting that the justification involves a comparison of the potential losses and their likelihoods.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires identifying probable outcomes and their averages. The individual considered losses and probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason, but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification involves comparing losses and noting the difference in probabilities, which does not directly state a preference based on the average of probable outcomes but does imply a consideration of the potential outcomes and their likelihoods. 
Based on these comparisons, while the individual considered relevant information (losses and probabilities), the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) is not clearly stated in the verbal report. The individual's focus on ""lower loss"" and comparison of probabilities suggests some alignment with the decision reason's considerations but lacks explicit mention of averaging probable outcomes or applying the specific rule of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For each lottery, we identify the probable outcomes based on the rule that an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. 
- For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is greater than 1/2 = 0.5. 
  - -4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is less than 0.5, so it is not probable.
  - 0 Euros has an 80% probability, which is greater than 0.5, so it is probable.
- For Lottery B, similarly, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is greater than 1/2 = 0.5.
  - -3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is less than 0.5, so it is not probable.
  - 0 Euros has a 75% probability, which is greater than 0.5, so it is probable.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable for both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros, making the decision reason indifferent between the two lotteries based on the provided probabilities and outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the similarity in the probability of not losing anything in both lotteries A and B and notes a 5% lower probability of losing 3000 Euros in B compared to losing 4000 Euros in A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the comparison of probabilities of losing money in both lotteries and the difference in the amount lost, rather than directly discussing the average of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, is the same for both lotteries (0 Euros), making the reason indifferent. The individual, however, focuses on the comparison of losing probabilities and amounts, not directly on the concept of probable outcomes or their averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes does not align with the individual’s justification, which is more about comparing probabilities of loss and the amounts lost.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery B is -3000 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of not losing money in each lottery, mentioning that Lottery A has a 55% chance of not losing money, while Lottery B has a 90% chance of losing money (implying a 10% chance of not losing).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the probability of not losing money, suggesting a preference for the lottery with a higher chance of avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, involves considering the outcomes with probabilities higher than 50%. The individual discusses probabilities but focuses on the chance of not losing money, which aligns with considering the outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery A but does not directly address the calculation of averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A (0 Euros) over Lottery B (-3000 Euros). The individual’s justification, while emphasizing the avoidance of loss, does not explicitly calculate or compare the averages of probable outcomes but seems to lean towards preferring Lottery A due to its higher chance of not resulting in a loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of not losing money and the implicit preference for Lottery A because of its higher chance of resulting in no loss somewhat aligns with the spirit of considering favorable outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes, which the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention or calculate. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for avoiding loss, the methodological alignment with the decision reason is weak, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is lower than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is lower than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values. For both lotteries, the probable outcome is 0 Euros. The decision reason would compare the average of these probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the very low loss probabilities in both options and noted that Lottery B offered a lower loss amount at a slightly higher risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparison of loss amounts and the associated risks, without explicit mention of calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, talks about the low probabilities of losses and the amounts, which indirectly relates to the concept of outcomes but does not directly address the calculation of averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on a comparison of loss amounts and risks, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason or applied a rule that prefers the lottery based on this average. The focus on loss amounts and risks in the verbal report does not align with the specific criteria outlined in the decision reason, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since 100% is always higher than 1/1 or 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying the probable outcomes and calculating their average for each lottery. For Lottery B, both the 1000 Euros and 0 Euros outcomes have a 50% probability, which meets the threshold for being considered probable. For Lottery A, the 500 Euros outcome is certain (100% probability), making it a probable outcome. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the certain gain (sicherer Gewinn) of Lottery A as more desirable than the possibility of doubling the gain with a 50% chance of not winning in Lottery B. This indicates the individual weighed the certainty of a gain against the risk of not gaining anything in one of the options. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice based on the desirability of a certain gain over a riskier option that could result in no gain, despite the potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is 500 Euros. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of gain versus the risk of no gain, which aligns with considering the outcomes but frames it in terms of risk preference rather than directly calculating averages of probable outcomes. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average (500 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, preferred Lottery A due to its certainty, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason’s focus on probable outcomes but emphasizes risk aversion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The assessment is 50 because, while the individual's focus on the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B reflects an understanding of the outcomes, it does not directly indicate the use of the specific decision reason provided, which is based on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is more aligned with a risk aversion principle rather than a direct application of the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable because their probabilities are exactly 50%, which meets the criteria for being considered probable in a two-outcome scenario.
- Lottery B has one outcome: -500 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possibility of losing half of their balance with a 50% probability in relation to one of the lotteries and notes that with the other lottery (B), they could minimize their potential loss with 100% certainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by focusing on the ability to minimize the potential loss with 100% certainty with Lottery B, implying a consideration of the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries results in -500 Euros. The individual, however, focuses on minimizing loss with certainty, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention averaging probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of -500 Euros, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, prefers Lottery B for its certainty of minimizing loss, which indirectly relates to the decision reason’s focus on probable outcomes but does not directly apply the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on minimizing loss with certainty and their consideration of the probability of losing half their balance aligns somewhat with considering probable outcomes, but they do not explicitly average these outcomes or directly apply the decision reason's rule. Thus, while there's a vague connection, it's clear that the decision reason as defined was not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, there are three outcomes: 6000 Euros is not an outcome, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. Since 1 divided by the number of outcomes (1/3) is approximately 0.33, the probable outcomes for Lottery A are those with probabilities higher than 0.33. In this case, only the 0 Euros outcome has a probability (50%) higher than 0.33, but since the decision reason considers outcomes with probabilities higher than 1/n, where n is the number of outcomes, we must consider all outcomes that meet this criterion based on their actual probabilities. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes: 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. Since 1 divided by the number of outcomes (1/2) is 0.5, the probable outcomes for Lottery B are those with probabilities higher than 0.5. In this case, only the 0 Euros outcome has a probability (75%) higher than 0.5. However, we must correct the understanding of probable outcomes according to the given definition: for Lottery A, outcomes with probabilities greater than 1/3 (which is approximately 0.33) are considered probable. Thus, the 0 Euros outcome is probable for both lotteries due to its high probability. For Lottery A, the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes do not meet the criteria based on the initial misinterpretation, but given their probabilities are exactly 0.25, they do not exceed the 1/3 threshold for being considered probable in the context of the decision reason as it was initially misapplied. The correct application should focus on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason, which means calculating the average of outcomes that meet the probability threshold for each lottery. 

For Lottery A, since none of the non-zero outcomes meet the criteria of having a probability greater than 1/3 (approximately 0.33), and the 0 Euros outcome does, we consider the average of the probable outcome, which would be 0 Euros for the calculation of the average of probable outcomes, as it's the only outcome meeting the criteria based on probability. For Lottery B, the 0 Euros outcome is the probable outcome. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. Given this correction, the relevant information for the decision reason includes identifying the probable outcomes and their average for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report mentions that Lottery A has a 50% higher chance of achieving a win compared to Lottery B. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of winning in their deliberation. The justification for the choice, as described, focuses on the comparative likelihood of achieving any win, which implies a consideration of the probability of non-zero outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (comparative likelihood of winning), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both involve considering probabilities, but the decision reason specifically focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the higher chance of winning with Lottery A, which does not directly align with calculating the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes does not seem to be explicitly applied in the individual's justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The assessment is based on the partial consideration of probabilities but a lack of direct alignment with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual calculated or considered the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason, suggesting that while probabilities were considered, the specific decision reason might not have been the basis for the choice."
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. 
- Lottery A: The probable outcome is 0 Euros with 75% probability because it exceeds the 50% threshold.
- Lottery B: The probable outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability because it exceeds the 33.33% threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, since only the 0 Euro outcome meets the probability threshold, its average of probable outcomes is also 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of not losing money in Lottery A but noted that the probability of losing 6000 Euros in A is the same as losing 2000 or 4000 Euros in B. They also considered the cumulative lower loss possibility in B (75% for not losing more than 2000 Euros) and compared the high loss in B (4000 Euros) to the high loss in A (6000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the probabilities and magnitudes of losses, considering both the likelihood of avoiding loss and the comparative sizes of potential losses in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on the given probabilities, are 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the comparative risks and potential losses, not explicitly calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have an average of probable outcomes of 0 Euros, the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, involves a more nuanced comparison of loss probabilities and magnitudes, not strictly adhering to the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. While the individual considers probabilities and outcomes, the specific rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes is not explicitly applied or mentioned. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used this particular decision reason to make their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery based on the decision reason's criteria. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (5 Euros) with a 100% probability, which is clearly higher than 1/1 (since there's only one outcome), so it's considered probable. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes: 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. Here, 1 divided by the number of outcomes (2) is 0.5. The 0 Euros outcome with a 99.9% probability is considered probable because its probability is higher than 0.5, but the 5000 Euros outcome is not because its probability (0.1%) is lower than 0.5. Thus, for Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 5 Euros (since there's only one outcome), and for Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report translates to ""Recognized certain win in A, seen almost certain no win in B."" This indicates the individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery A and the near certainty of not winning in Lottery B. The individual's justification seems to focus on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A versus the highly unlikely outcome of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning in A and near certainty of not winning in B), there's a similarity in the sense that both involve evaluating the likelihood of outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically calculates averages of probable outcomes, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A seems based on the guarantee it offers rather than an explicit comparison of the average probable outcomes between the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A in this case (5 Euros vs. 0 Euros), aligning with the individual's choice but not explicitly stated as the reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, and there's a focus on the certainty and near certainty of outcomes, the explicit calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes as per the decision reason are not clearly outlined in the verbal report. Thus, there's a degree of uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome with a probability greater than 1/1 = 1 is considered probable, which applies to the -5 Euros outcome since it has a 100% probability. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so any outcome with a probability greater than 1/2 = 0.5 is considered probable. This applies to the 0 Euros outcome with a 99.9% probability but not to the -5000 Euros outcome with a 0.1% probability. Thus, the probable outcomes are -5 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss of Lottery A and the very improbable high loss of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the high loss of B being very improbable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are -5 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The individual considered the certain loss of A and the improbability of the high loss of B, which aligns with focusing on the outcomes but doesn't explicitly mention calculating an average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is about the improbability of the high loss in B, not explicitly about comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's focus was more on the probability of the high loss in B rather than on calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason suggests. However, the individual does seem to consider the nature of the outcomes in a manner that could be interpreted as loosely aligned with the decision reason, especially since the decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its higher average of probable outcomes (0 Euros vs. -5 Euros).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects a leaning towards the decision reason not being directly used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes or directly applying the rule as stated in the decision reason. However, it's not a complete mismatch, as the individual's consideration of the outcomes' probabilities and their implications shows some alignment with the spirit of evaluating lotteries based on their probable outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1 divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, the number of outcomes is 2, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 50%. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (1500 Euros) with a 100% probability, which is clearly probable. For Lottery B, both outcomes have a 50% probability, which exactly meets the threshold for being considered probable but does not exceed it. However, given the context, it seems reasonable to interpret that both outcomes of Lottery B could be considered in the evaluation since they both meet the minimum threshold for being probable. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason includes the outcomes of both lotteries and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, if we consider both outcomes as per the reason's criteria for being probable (since they are at the threshold), the average would be (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the certain gain in Lottery A and the potential double loss in Lottery B with 50% probability. Second, the justification for the choice seems to emphasize the security of the gain in Lottery A over the risk of loss in Lottery B. The described deliberation process focuses on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A versus the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probable outcomes and their averages for both lotteries) with what the individual considered (security of gain in A, potential loss in B), there is a partial alignment. The individual seems to have focused on the guaranteed aspect of Lottery A and the risky aspect of Lottery B, which could imply consideration of the probable outcomes. However, the individual's focus was more on the risk aspect rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (emphasizing the security of the gain), there is a conceptual alignment in that both lead to preferring Lottery A, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating averages or comparing them as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while there is some alignment between the decision reason and the individual's deliberation process, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly state that they calculated or compared the averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason would dictate. However, the emphasis on the security of the gain in Lottery A suggests an implicit consideration of the decision reason's criteria, leading to a higher assessment than a pure uncertainty (50) but not a full certainty (100) that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, which meets the threshold, so both are considered probable. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. Since the single outcome of Lottery B has a probability of 1, it is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sichere Gewinnwahl"", which translates to ""safe win"" or ""secure gain"", indicating they considered the certainty of gaining something.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The mention of ""sichere Gewinnwahl"" implies the individual's justification is based on the guarantee of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating probabilities and outcomes. The individual's consideration of a ""safe win"" implies a focus on the certainty of a gain, which aligns with considering the probability of outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its certain and positive outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be its guaranteed positive outcome, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for a higher average of probable outcomes, given that Lottery B's single outcome is both probable and positive.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the decision reason's preference for a guaranteed positive outcome (as calculated through the average of probable outcomes) and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B based on its ""safe win"" nature. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes, hence not a 100% certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (1000 Euros) with a probability of 100%, which is clearly probable. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes (-3000 Euros and 3000 Euros), each with a 50% probability. Since 50% is higher than 1/2 (one divided by the number of outcomes in Lottery B), both outcomes of Lottery B are considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A due to its higher average of probable outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual recognized a safe gain in Lottery A and acknowledged a 50% possible triple loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus was on the safety of the gain in Lottery A versus the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages. The individual considered the safety of the gain in A and the risk of loss in B, which aligns with focusing on the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification emphasizes the safety of the gain in Lottery A over the potential for a significant loss in Lottery B, which implicitly suggests preferring the certain gain over the gamble but does not explicitly mention averaging outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report indicates an understanding of the outcomes and their implications, focusing on the safety of Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B. While the report does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason does, the emphasis on the certain gain in Lottery A over the gamble of Lottery B suggests a preference that aligns with the decision reason's rule. However, without explicit mention of averaging or considering probabilities in the manner described by the decision reason, it's not certain that the individual used this specific reason. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A (6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability) meet this criterion because their probabilities are exactly 50%, which is not higher but equal to the threshold. However, for the purpose of calculating the average of probable outcomes as per the decision reason, we consider outcomes with probabilities of 50% or more. Thus, both outcomes of Lottery A are considered probable for the calculation of the average. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average value for each lottery.

- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes = (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the average (and only outcome) = 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially noted a 50% chance of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A, then recognized a 0% chance of loss in Lottery B, concluding no loss is preferable.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the absence of loss in Lottery B, implying a preference for avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. The individual's focus was on the absence of loss in Lottery B and the risk of loss in Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but does not explicitly calculate or compare averages.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on avoiding loss, which aligns with preferring Lottery B because it has no negative outcome, but does not explicitly state a comparison of averages.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason (comparing averages of probable outcomes), but it does reflect a concern for avoiding negative outcomes, which is consistent with the general direction of preferring a lottery with more favorable probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used as described, because while the individual's choice and justification are consistent with a preference for avoiding loss (which aligns with the general direction of the decision reason), the verbal report does not demonstrate a clear application of the decision reason's specific rule regarding the average of probable outcomes."
