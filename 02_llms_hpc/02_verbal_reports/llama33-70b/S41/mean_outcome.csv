STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a very low loss risk (""das sehr geringe Verlustrisiko""), implying they considered the risk of losing (0 Euros outcome) in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that this low loss risk is not worth the potential gain (""ist dem Gewinn trotzdem nicht wert""), indicating they weighed the potential loss against the potential gain but did not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (low loss risk and its worth relative to the gain): The individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes, focusing instead on the risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (low loss risk not being worth the gain): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as it does not involve comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are 1200 Euros for Lottery A and 1250 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit ist besser als nur 100 Euro mehr Gewinn,"" which translates to ""a higher probability is better than just 100 Euros more winnings."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the difference in potential winnings.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to prioritize the higher probability over the slightly higher potential winnings of the other lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and difference in potential winnings). The individual's consideration does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prioritizing higher probability over slightly higher winnings). The decision reason's rule does not match the individual's justification, as the individual focuses on probability and the difference in winnings rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The report mentions ""kein Risiko"" which translates to ""no risk"" and ""100 Prozent Gewinn"" which translates to ""100 percent win"". This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect and the certainty of winning.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize avoiding risk and ensuring a win, as indicated by focusing on ""100 Prozent Gewinn"" which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and certainty of winning): The individual's focus was more on the risk aspect and the guarantee of winning rather than directly comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk and ensuring a win): The decision reason's rule does not directly align with the individual's justification, as the individual's choice seems driven by risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed win rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on risk aversion and the guarantee of a win, which does not align with the decision reason's calculation of mean outcomes to make a choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1500 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Geldsumme von 1000 ist das höhere Risiko wert,"" which translates to ""A sum of money of 1000 is worth the higher risk."" This statement suggests the individual is considering the potential reward in relation to the risk but does not directly mention calculating means or comparing the specific outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to imply that a certain amount of money (1000 Euros) is worth taking a higher risk for, but this does not clearly align with the calculation of mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses risk in relation to a specific sum of money, not directly addressing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not clearly indicate a preference based on calculated mean outcomes but rather on a perceived risk-reward balance.

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the decision reason (calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries) to make the decision. The mention of risk and a specific sum of money does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The report mentions ""sicherer Gewinn"" (safe win) and ""fast 90 Prozent Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (almost 90 percent probability of winning), indicating the individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report states that ""Wahrscheinlichkeit vom Gewinn ist dabei wichtiger als die Summe oder Abzug"" (the probability of winning is more important than the sum or subtraction), suggesting the individual prioritized the high probability of a win over the potential total amount that could be won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning, safety of the win), it appears the individual focused more on the probability aspect rather than calculating mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (prioritizing the probability of winning), it's clear the individual's decision-making process differed from the decision reason provided.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of winning and the safety of the win, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""volles Risiko"" (full risk) and ""halbierten Chancen"" (halved chances), indicating they considered the risk and probability aspects of the lotteries. However, the specific outcomes (6000 Euros and 3000 Euros) and their exact probabilities are not explicitly mentioned in relation to a calculation or comparison of mean outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk and the comparative chances of winning, with ""mt halbierten Chancen auf einen höheren Gewinn"" suggesting they considered the potential for a higher gain despite lower chances. The phrase ""tritt wahrscheinlich eh nicht ein"" implies a skepticism about the likelihood of winning, but does not directly address a calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems to focus more on the risk, chances, and potential for a higher gain rather than calculating mean outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual's justification, however, does not clearly indicate a preference based on calculated mean outcomes but rather on the perceived risk and potential for a higher gain.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make their decision, since there's no clear indication they calculated or compared the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is -3000 / 1 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because -2000 is greater than -3000. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the calculation of their means.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The report mentions ""risikoreich"" which translates to ""risk-rich"" or ""high risk,"" indicating the individual considered the risk aspect of the decision. It also mentions ""nur -1000 mehr bei falscher Entscheidung,"" which translates to ""only -1000 more in case of wrong decision."" This suggests the individual considered the potential loss difference between the two options but does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing outcomes directly as the decision reason would.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the risk and the potential additional loss of -1000 Euros if the ""wrong"" decision is made, implying a consideration of the potential downsides but not explicitly stating how the decision was justified in terms of the mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and potential loss difference), there's a discrepancy. The individual's focus does not explicitly align with calculating and comparing mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on risk and potential loss difference), there's no direct alignment. The decision reason is based on a specific mathematical calculation (mean outcome), which is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report.

Based on these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make the decision, given the lack of direct reference to calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A would be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number, which can be derived from the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""geringeres prozentuales Risiko"" which translates to ""lower percentage risk,"" indicating the individual considered the probabilities of the losses. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests that the lower percentage risk outweighs the potential monetary loss (""überwiegt dem potentiellen Geldverlust""), implying the individual's decision was influenced by comparing the risk levels associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities or the concept of ""risk"" as mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the percentage risk, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of risks and potential losses, not the mean outcomes of the lotteries. This indicates a different basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report focuses on the comparison of risks and potential losses, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on the mean outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report is in German and translates to ""High risk, but good percentage distribution."" This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect and the probability distribution of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not explicitly state the justification but hints at a consideration of risk and probability, which might imply a comparison of the two lotteries based on these aspects.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which does not directly relate to the ""risk"" and ""percentage distribution"" mentioned in the verbal report. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason's rule is about comparing the mean outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual seems to focus more on the risk and probability aspects rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros vs -3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""0.1 Prozent weniger Risko"" (0.1 percent less risk), which suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes. However, it does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing outcomes directly as per the decision reason.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report states ""nicht wert"" (not worth it), implying that the individual weighed the potential risk against the potential gain and decided one option was not worth the risk compared to the other. The justification seems to focus on the concept of risk rather than directly comparing mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and risk), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual's focus on risk does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on risk and whether it's worth it), there's no clear indication that the individual used the mean outcome calculation to make their decision. The mention of ""less risk"" suggests a different line of reasoning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment indicates that, based on the provided verbal report, it is certain that the decision reason (calculating and comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries) was not used by the individual to make the decision. The individual's focus on risk and the report's lack of mention of mean outcomes or a similar calculation method support this conclusion."

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since the mean outcomes of both lotteries are equal, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is not explicitly stated in terms of specific outcomes or probabilities, but the phrase ""sicherer Gewinn ist besser als das Verlustrisiko"" translates to ""a certain gain is better than the risk of loss."" This implies the individual considered the certainty of gain (in Lottery B) versus the risk of loss (in Lottery A). 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to prioritize avoiding loss or valuing certainty, which suggests a preference for Lottery B due to its guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their mean) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain vs. risk of loss), it appears the individual focused more on the certainty aspect rather than calculating mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty over risk), it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason’s rule since the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries due to their equal mean outcomes, but the individual shows a preference for Lottery B based on a different criterion (certainty).

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean is -500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are -1000 and 0 for Lottery A, and -500 for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringeres Risiko"" which translates to ""lower risk"". This implies the individual considered the risk or uncertainty associated with each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The phrase ""auch bei 100 prozentigen Abzug"" translates to ""also with 100 percent deduction"", which suggests the individual is considering the guaranteed loss in one of the lotteries, likely comparing the certainty of loss in Lottery B to the risk of loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is -500 for both. However, the individual discusses risk, which isn't directly related to the calculation of mean outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (-500), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, seems to be focusing on the risk aspect, not the mean outcome directly, suggesting a different basis for their decision.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""gleiches Risiko für 0"" which translates to ""same risk for 0"" and ""sichere Variante"" which translates to ""safe variant"". This suggests the individual considered the risk of getting 0 Euros and the presence of a safer option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk aspect and the idea of a safer option, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or comparing the total value of outcomes across lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""weniger Risiko durch höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit bei 0"", which translates to ""less risk due to a higher probability of 0"". This indicates the individual considered the risk aspect, specifically focusing on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be centered around minimizing risk by choosing the option with a higher probability of a neutral (0 Euro) outcome, rather than directly comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, talks about risk and the probability of the 0 Euro outcome, not directly about the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B in this case), whereas the individual's justification is based on minimizing risk by preferring a higher probability of a 0 Euro outcome. These do not align directly, as the decision reason does not consider probabilities in its calculation, but rather the aggregate value of outcomes.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome would be (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome would be (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""bei dem Unterschied kann man Risiko nehmen,"" which translates to ""with this difference, one can take a risk."" This suggests the individual considered the difference between the two lotteries and the concept of risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report implies that the individual is willing to take a risk due to the difference between the lotteries, but it does not explicitly state how the difference was evaluated or what specific aspects of the lotteries were considered.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is not directly related to the concept of risk-taking mentioned in the verbal report.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason’s focus on mean outcomes. The mention of risk-taking suggests a consideration of probabilities or the potential for loss and gain, rather than a straightforward comparison of mean outcomes.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-5 Euros > -2500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (99%) of no loss in Lottery A as very convincing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the high probability of no loss, which implies they were swayed by the low risk of losing a significant amount in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly relate to the probability of no loss considered by the individual. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification emphasizes the probability of avoiding loss, not the mean outcome. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that involves calculating mean outcomes to make their decision. Instead, they focused on the risk aspect presented by the high probability of no loss in one of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""sicherer Gewinn,"" which translates to ""safe win"" or ""certain gain"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability, which aligns with the concept of a ""safe win."" The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty and positivity of the outcome rather than explicitly calculating means or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the gain), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason specifically looks at the mean of all outcomes, which does not directly relate to the concept of a ""safe win"" unless the individual implicitly understood that a certain gain (1500 Euros) has a higher mean than a lottery with a potential loss (Lottery B). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing the sum of outcomes divided by their number, which is the core of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the specific decision reason provided, as the verbal report focuses on the certainty of the gain rather than the calculation of mean outcomes. However, it does not completely rule out an implicit understanding that could align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome, given the context of the decision problem."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sichere Variante für Geldgewinn,"" which translates to ""secure option for money gain."" This suggests the individual considered the aspect of gaining money securely.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report implies that the individual chose the option that guarantees a money gain without risk, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it offers a 100% chance of gaining 2000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, while the individual considered the security of gaining money. These are not directly related, as the individual's focus is on risk rather than the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), and the individual chose Lottery A but based on its secure money gain aspect, not explicitly the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (choosing Lottery A) but for different reasons (security of gain rather than mean outcome). However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the mean outcomes or comparing them, which is central to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's criteria (focusing on mean outcomes). The low score indicates it's unlikely the decision reason was used as the basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000) / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report states ""sicherer Gewinn ohne Risiko,"" which translates to ""secure win without risk."" This implies the individual considered the aspect of risk or certainty of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests the individual preferred a secure or risk-free option, which aligns with choosing an outcome that is certain over one that involves risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (security and risk). The individual's focus on security and risk does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes based on the number of outcomes independent of their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a secure win without risk). The decision reason's rule does not directly consider risk or certainty, which was the individual's focus.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report focuses on the aspect of risk and certainty, which does not align with the decision reason's method of calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome would be (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 0 Euros since there is only one outcome of 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros according to this reason. The relevant information for this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""zu großes Risiko bei Lotterie B"", which translates to ""too much risk in Lottery B"". This indicates that the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B as a factor in their decision. The individual's justification for their choice seems to be based on the perceived risk of Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk associated with Lottery B), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros according to this rule, it would suggest indifference between the two lotteries based solely on mean outcomes. However, the individual's justification is based on risk, not the comparison of mean outcomes. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as defined to make their decision.
