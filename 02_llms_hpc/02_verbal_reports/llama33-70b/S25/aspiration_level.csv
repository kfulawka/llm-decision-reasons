STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. To calculate the aspiration level, we first need to list all unique outcomes from both lotteries: 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 2500 Euros. The aspiration level is (0 + 2400 + 2500) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 0 Euros, -1633.33; for 2400 Euros, 766.67; and for 2500 Euros, 866.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is associated with outcomes 2400 Euros (66% probability) and 2500 Euros (33% probability), totaling 99% probability of a positive difference (since 1% leads to a 0 Euro outcome, which is not a positive difference). In Lottery A, the outcome is always 2400 Euros, which also represents a positive difference from the aspiration level, but with 100% probability. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B, indicating they considered the risk of the lowest outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they take into account the 1% chance of possibly winning nothing in Lottery B, implying risk aversion or a focus on avoiding the worst outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the risk of the worst outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning or implying the calculation of an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding the risk of winning nothing, which does not directly align with comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on avoiding the worst outcome and their justification for choosing Lottery A based on this consideration do not align with the decision reason's process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros for A, and 2500 Euros and 0 Euros for B. The aspiration level is (2400 + 0 + 2500 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 and 0 - 1225 = -1225; for Lottery B, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225), while Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225). Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of winning between the two lotteries (1% more chance of winning with Lottery A) and the difference in the amount that could be won (100 Euros more with Lottery B).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred having a 1% higher chance of winning over winning 100 Euros more.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the probabilities of these differences) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning and the amount that could be won): The individual did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, but they did consider the probabilities of winning, which is a component of the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a higher chance of winning): While the individual's justification involves preferring a higher chance of winning, it does not directly address the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the preference for a higher chance of winning aligns with preferring a higher probability of achieving a positive outcome, which could be interpreted as related to the decision reason's focus on positive differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from it, and their probabilities), but it shares a preference for higher probabilities of positive outcomes. This indicates some level of alignment but not a clear, direct application of the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33; for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it does not come with the risk of earning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of the aspiration level and the consideration of the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. However, the verbal report does not mention these calculations. The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, whereas the individual chose Lottery A to avoid the risk of earning nothing. While avoiding risk can be related to the concept of positive differences, the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, as it does not mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding risk) is somewhat related to the concept of positive differences but is not a direct application of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certain that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because they felt the 5% difference (in probabilities) was too small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, which does not directly match the individual's comparison of outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification. The individual's focus was on the perceived small difference in probabilities (5%), not on the aspiration level or the differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from this level. The justification provided by the individual is based on a different criterion (the perceived small difference in probabilities), indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the provided steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the individual’s justification for the choice, only the process of comparing outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of outcomes and their differences from an aspiration level, but the verbal report only mentions comparing outcomes and probabilities without referencing an aspiration level or differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the verbal report does not provide a clear justification for the choice beyond comparing outcomes and probabilities, it's difficult to directly compare it to the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not provide sufficient information to confirm that the individual used the decision reason. The individual's process of comparing outcomes and probabilities is a common approach but does not specifically align with the unique aspects of the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
6,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level (2250 Euros) and the differences between outcomes and this level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is that the chances of winning are very low in both lotteries, and they prefer the lottery with the larger, albeit unlikely, win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and this level) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and this level. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual's justification (preferring the larger, unlikely win due to low chances of winning in both), there is a partial alignment in the sense that both involve considering the magnitude of potential wins, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there is a slight alignment in the preference for the larger win, the individual's decision-making process as described does not closely follow the specific rule outlined by the decision reason regarding aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes is (-3000 + (-4000) + 0) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance to remain loss-free (verlustfrei zu bleiben), which implies considering the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the chance to remain loss-free.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences between outcomes and this level, which does not directly match the individual's focus on the chance to remain loss-free. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it offers a chance (20% probability) of a positive difference (0 Euros, which is better than the aspiration level), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level. 

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for a lottery offering a chance of a positive outcome (remaining loss-free), the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly reflect the calculation of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment of whether the decision reason was used is uncertain, leaning towards not being used due to the lack of direct reference to the aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences in the verbal report.

The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with a probability of 80% and 75% respectively, which is a positive difference from the aspiration level, we need to consider these probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing money in each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred having only a 1/5 chance (20% probability) of losing money.

These differences are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B but did not explicitly state the justification in terms of aspiration levels or differences from an aspiration level. The statement ""Wie jedes Mal verglich ich erstmal die Ergebnisse und dann die Wahrscheinlichkeit"" translates to ""As always, I first compared the outcomes and then the probabilities,"" which does not directly mention the aspiration level or the decision reason's rule.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual compared outcomes and probabilities, which is a part of the necessary information but does not directly relate to the aspiration level calculation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is the same as above, 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 0.2% chance of -3000 Euros and a 99.8% chance of 0 Euros, while Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of -6000 Euros and a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros. The positive differences are associated with the 0 Euro outcomes. Thus, Lottery A has a 99.8% chance of a positive difference (2250), and Lottery B has a 99.9% chance of a positive difference (2250). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery A because it seemed ""am sinnvollsten,"" which translates to ""the most sensible."" This statement is vague and does not directly indicate what factors the individual considered or how they justified their choice beyond it seeming sensible. The report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level, the differences between outcomes and an aspiration level, or the probabilities of positive differences. It focuses on the overall sensibility of the choice without providing specific deliberation details.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and the probabilities of these differences) with what the individual considered (the choice seemed sensible), there's a significant lack of direct connection. The individual's justification (""am sinnvollsten"") does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level). The verbal report lacks specific references to the aspiration level, outcome differences, or the probabilities of positive differences, which are crucial for the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the lack of explicit connection between the decision reason's criteria (aspiration level, outcome differences, and their probabilities) and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (it seemed the most sensible). The verbal report does not provide sufficient information to suggest that the decision reason was used, leading to a conclusion that it is certain the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (its difference is 0, which is not considered positive), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred a secure gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on outcomes and probabilities in a more general sense.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual's justification of preferring a secure gain. The individual's choice can be seen as risk-averse, focusing on the certainty of the gain rather than the potential for a positive difference from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason regarding aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences. The focus on a ""secure gain"" suggests a different rationale for the choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery A because they chose the chance to make no loss (""Ich wählte Lotterie A, da ich die Chance wählte keinen Verlust zu machen""). This statement implies that the individual considered the possibility of not losing any money (0 Euros outcome in Lottery A) as a significant factor in their decision. The individual’s justification for the choice focuses on avoiding a loss, which suggests they were considering the outcomes of the lotteries and their potential to result in no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (avoiding a loss, the chance of no loss), it seems the individual did consider aspects related to the outcomes but not explicitly in terms of an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding a loss) does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level). However, the desire to avoid a loss could indirectly relate to seeking positive differences (in this case, avoiding a negative outcome), but it does not explicitly match the decision reason's criteria of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding a loss and the chance of no loss indicates some alignment with considering outcomes and their implications, but the explicit process described does not match the decision reason's specific criteria of using an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, while there's a slight connection in the concern for outcomes, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not evident in the verbal report."

For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level, and the 2000 Euros outcome is exactly at the aspiration level, thus not considered positive). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery B because it was associated with less risk. The information considered by the individual seems to involve the concept of risk. The justification for the choice is based on the perceived lower risk of Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (risk), there doesn't seem to be a direct match, as the individual's focus was on risk rather than the aspiration level or the specific differences from it. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification is about risk. Given the information, the individual's reasoning process as described does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of all outcomes: (-4000 - 2000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, (-4000 - (-2200)) = -1800, (-2000 - (-2200)) = 200, (0 - (-2200)) = 2200; for Lottery B, (-6000 - (-2200)) = -3800, (0 - (-2200)) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 50% (one outcome out of two with positive difference, but considering the probability of each outcome, it's 25% for -2000 and 50% for 0, so the calculation should consider the actual probabilities of each outcome which are 25% for -2000, 25% for -4000, and 50% for 0, thus the probability of positive difference is 50% since only the 0 outcome provides a positive difference with a probability of 50%). For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since only the 0 outcome provides a positive difference with a probability of 75%). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B, but the justification provided does not explicitly state why Lottery B was chosen over Lottery A based on the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, which aligns with the information needed to apply the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B (since it has a 75% chance of a positive difference, considering the 0 outcome). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as the reason for choosing Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences was used to make the decision. While the individual did choose Lottery B, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the justification provided does not explicitly mention the key elements of the decision reason. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but given the lack of direct evidence, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5000 - 1671.67 ≈ 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 ≈ -1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5 - 1671.67 ≈ -1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference and a 99.9% probability of a negative difference, and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions preferring to achieve a win rather than none, which implies considering the presence of a potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because they prefer to achieve a win, indicating a focus on the potential for gaining something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the presence of a potential win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which is not directly related to the individual’s justification of preferring to achieve a win rather than none. The individual’s justification does not explicitly consider probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's focus is more on the existence of a potential win rather than the calculated aspiration level and its associated probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -5000, 0, and -5, which is (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5000 + 0 - 5 = -5005 / 3 = -1668.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1668.33) = -3331.67 and 0 - (-1668.33) = 1668.33; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1668.33) = 1663.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred a minimal loss over a small chance of a large loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and this level. The individual compared outcomes and probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or considering differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on avoiding a large loss, which aligns with preferring minimal losses but does not directly mention the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's focus on avoiding a large loss and preferring a minimal loss aligns somewhat with the concept of managing risk, which is a part of the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating an aspiration level and considering probabilities of positive differences from this level, which the individual does not mention. Therefore, while there is a superficial alignment in risk aversion, the specific mechanism of the decision reason does not appear to be directly applied by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (2500) and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1000), but the reason specifically looks at the probability of positive differences, we must consider how these differences and their probabilities align with the decision reason. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report does not explicitly mention the consideration of outcomes, probabilities, or any specific decision criteria like aspiration levels or differences from such levels. The individual states they chose Lottery A because it seemed ""am sinnvollsten,"" which translates to ""the most sensible"" or ""made the most sense,"" without providing further justification.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is vague and does not directly reference any specific factors like probabilities, outcomes, or the concept of aspiration levels. The choice is based on an intuitive or undefined sense of what seemed most sensible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The verbal report does not mention these specific considerations, suggesting a potential mismatch.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason has a clear, defined rule based on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. In contrast, the individual’s justification is vague and does not clearly align with this rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the decision reason, which involves a specific calculation and consideration of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level, does not directly align with the information provided in the verbal report. The report lacks explicit mention of these factors, suggesting that the individual may not have used the decision reason as described.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is 666.67 Euros, Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (when the outcome is 3000 Euros) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (when the outcome is -3000 Euros), while Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference (since 2000 Euros is greater than 666.67 Euros). Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of achieving a gain, implying they focused on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to ensure a gain, suggesting risk aversion or a preference for certainty over potential higher but uncertain gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, which does not directly match the individual's stated focus on ensuring a gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it guarantees a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level. However, the choice of Lottery A because it guarantees a gain could indirectly reflect a preference for a positive difference from an implicit aspiration level of 0 (no gain or loss), which aligns with the decision reason’s preference for positive differences but does not directly apply the decision reason as defined.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome preferred by the decision reason under certain interpretations, the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly apply the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's focus on ensuring a gain could be seen as related but does not clearly demonstrate the use of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 0 = 3000 and -3000 - 0 = -3000; for Lottery B, 1000 - 0 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing the second option (1000 Euros) of Lottery B to an unspecified first option, which is not relevant to the current decision problem. However, it indicates the individual is considering the outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they perceived the second option (1000 Euros) as too bad compared to some previous or hypothetical first option. This suggests the individual is making a comparison based on the outcomes but does not explicitly mention probabilities or the concept of aspiration levels.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not mention calculating an aspiration level or explicitly comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on a comparison of outcomes but does not explicitly involve probabilities or the concept of an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the perceived value of the outcomes rather than on calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level = (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 6000 - 0 = 6000 and -6000 - 0 = -6000; for Lottery A, 0 - 0 = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), we can derive that the decision reason would prefer Lottery B if it strictly follows the rule of maximizing the probability of positive differences. However, the actual application depends on the individual's consideration and justification as described in the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros with 50% probability as too great.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of the perceived high risk associated with losing a significant amount in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the risk of loss associated with Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 50% chance of winning 6000 Euros. However, the individual chose Lottery A due to risk aversion regarding the potential loss, not because of a consideration of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The individual's focus on risk aversion and the perceived high risk of losing money in Lottery B does not indicate the use of the decision reason based on aspiration levels and positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
