1,"Decision reason:
The reason considers the aspiration level. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500, 2400, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. Combining all outcomes, we have (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros as the aspiration level. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, (2500-1825), (2400-1825), and (0-1825); for Lottery B, (2400-1825). These differences are 675, 575, -1825, and 575, respectively. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) in Lottery A and the higher potential gain (100 Euros more than 2400 Euros, implying the 2500 Euros outcome) in Lottery A compared to the fixed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the chance of winning nothing is very low, and there's a chance to win 100 Euros more than the fixed amount offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences but focuses on the potential gains and the low probability of winning nothing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery A due to its potential for higher gain despite the low risk of winning nothing, which indirectly relates to preferring outcomes that are positive differences from a certain baseline (though not explicitly the aspiration level calculated).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The report focuses more on the direct comparison of potential gains and the risk of winning nothing, without explicit consideration of an aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have one positive and one negative difference, we need to compare the probabilities of the positive outcomes. Lottery A has a 33% probability of a positive difference, and Lottery B has a 34% probability of a positive difference. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the percentage difference and the sum of the outcomes but finds them not very important. They also mention that they could end up without a loss or gain but would choose the higher amount as a gain even with a slightly lower probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on preferring the higher gain (2500 Euros) over the slightly lower gain (2400 Euros) in Lottery B, despite the probability difference being insignificant to them. They also state that the decision was not very important to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual's stated considerations of percentage differences and sums. However, the individual does mention considering the higher gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 34% probability of the positive outcome compared to Lottery A's 33%. The individual's justification, however, seems to favor the higher gain (Lottery A's 2500 Euros) despite acknowledging the probability difference is not significant. This does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not closely align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While there's a mention of considering the higher gain, the overall justification provided by the individual does not suggest a systematic application of the decision reason's rule. The individual's emphasis on the insignificance of probability differences and the preference for the higher amount without clear consideration of the aspiration level or probability of positive differences leads to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has an 80% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries, comparing the certain gain of Lottery A with the potential gain of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it is the safer option, ensuring a significant gain without any risk of loss. The individual mentions that if there were a larger difference between the certain gain of A and the potential gain of B, they would have chosen B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the amounts and probabilities but does not mention calculating an aspiration level or explicitly discussing the probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual's choice of the safer option (Lottery A) but does not directly match the individual's justification focusing on the absence of risk and the size of the potential gains.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While the individual's choice of the safer option (Lottery A) coincidentally matches what the decision reason would prefer, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not closely follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 1750 = 2250 (positive) and 0 - 1750 = -1750 (negative)
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 1750 = 1250 (positive) and 0 - 1750 = -1750 (negative)
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We need to calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery:
- Lottery B has a 20% probability of a positive difference (2250) and an 80% probability of a negative difference (-1750).
- Lottery A has a 25% probability of a positive difference (1250) and a 75% probability of a negative difference (-1750).
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of positive differences for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual compared the ""WK"" (which can be translated to ""chance"" or ""probability"" in English) of the possible winnings and decided on Lottery B because the winnings are relatively higher compared to the lower probability of winning this amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the winnings and their respective probabilities, focusing on the higher potential winnings in Lottery B despite the lower probability, and mentions that the difference in probabilities (1 out of 4 vs. 1 out of 5) is not significant, especially since there's nothing to lose.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration is more directly on the comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A in this case (25% probability of a positive difference vs. 20% for Lottery B). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on the relative height of the winnings despite the lower probability, not explicitly considering the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's justification is based on a different aspect of the lotteries (relative winnings and their probabilities), indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros (twice, since it appears in both lotteries), and 3000 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 0 + 3000) / 4 = 4500 / 4 = 1125 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 6000 Euros, the difference is 6000 - 1125 = 4875; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 1125 = -1125; and for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 1125 = 1875. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given Lottery A (6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability) and Lottery B (3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability), we can derive that Lottery A offers a 45% chance of a positive difference (4875) and a 55% chance of a negative difference (-1125), while Lottery B offers a 90% chance of a positive difference (1875) and a 10% chance of a negative difference (-1125). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the possible gains and the amounts of money. They compared these aspects between the two lotteries, focusing on the attractiveness of the potential gain of 6000 Euros in Lottery A despite its lower probability compared to the more certain but lower gain of 3000 Euros in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the risk of ending up with no money, the potential gain of 6000 Euros was very attractive. They acknowledged that while Lottery B offered a higher probability of winning (90% for 3000 Euros), the potential regret of not taking the higher-risk, higher-reward option (Lottery A) if the lower-probability loss in Lottery B occurred (10% chance of getting 0 Euros) influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of outcomes relative to such a level. Instead, they focus on the attractiveness of the potential gains and the probabilities of those gains.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of the potential gain and the consideration of regret, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus was more on the direct comparison of potential gains and their probabilities rather than on an aspiration level and the probabilities of exceeding it.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 6000 Euros, the difference is 6000 - 2250 = 3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250; for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 2250 = 750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of winning (WK) is very low for both lotteries and that they would prefer the higher amount because they have nothing to lose.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that since the probability of winning is low for both, they might as well choose the lottery with the higher potential win because there's no loss involved.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focuses on the low probability of winning and the preference for the higher potential win without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the higher potential win due to the low overall probability of winning and the absence of potential loss, not explicitly because of the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not explicitly involve calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes based on their differences from this level. While the individual does express a preference for the higher potential win, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes, the underlying reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, leading to a low assessment score."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + (-4000) + 0) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 20% probability of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) and Lottery A has no positive difference. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amounts of both lotteries and the probability of no loss in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because it offered a moderate probability of no loss, despite the higher potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the loss amounts and the probability of no loss but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual preferred Lottery B because of the probability of no loss, which can be seen as a positive difference from the aspiration level. However, the individual did not explicitly state that they preferred Lottery B because it had a higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with the general idea of preferring an option with a chance of a better outcome (no loss), which could relate to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the individual did not explicitly calculate or mention an aspiration level, nor did they directly compare probabilities of positive differences as the decision reason requires. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the preference for a lottery with a potential for a ""positive"" outcome (no loss), the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not closely match the decision reason's specifics."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros (twice, since it appears in both lotteries), and -3000 Euros.
- The aspiration level is (-4000 + 0 + 0 + (-3000)) / 4 = -4000 / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between each outcome and this aspiration level. For Lottery A, the differences are -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros.
Given the probabilities, we can calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 80% (since the 0 Euro outcome is considered a positive difference from the aspiration level). For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is also 75%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual considered the amount of loss in each lottery and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, stating that a 5% difference in probabilities is not significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred a smaller loss over a potentially higher loss, indicating that the magnitude of the loss was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of potential losses and the difference in probabilities, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A (80% probability of a positive difference) over Lottery B (75% probability of a positive difference). The individual, however, chose Lottery B based on preferring a smaller loss, not explicitly considering the probability of positive outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification and the factors they considered (magnitude of loss and significance of probability differences) do not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from those levels. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus calculated as: (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the outcomes and their probabilities, we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to focus on the concept of ""Nicht-Verlust"" (non-loss), implying they prioritize avoiding losses. They mention comparing the potential losses between the two lotteries, noting that with Lottery A, they might lose twice as much but with Lottery B, they would lose half as much almost for certain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A by stating they are willing to take the risk of a larger loss because with Lottery B, they feel they would lose half as much but almost certainly. They express relief at the prospect of getting 0 Euros, which suggests they are risk-averse regarding losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus is more on the avoidance of certain losses and the risk of larger losses, which does not directly align with the aspiration level calculation or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the risk of loss and the certainty of outcomes, not directly on the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they do not mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. Their focus is more on loss aversion and the certainty of outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, positive differences occur when the outcome is 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability difference between the losses of the two lotteries and decided it was negligible (0.1% difference is ""so gut wie kein Unterschied""). The individual also considered the amount of potential loss, preferring to lose less money even if the probability of loss is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability difference between the losses is negligible, and they would rather lose less money (3000 Euros vs 6000 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the difference in potential losses and the negligible difference in their probabilities, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this scenario would relate to the probability of outcomes being better than the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring to lose less money due to the negligible difference in loss probabilities, not directly addressing the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While the individual does consider the impact of potential losses and their probabilities, the core elements of the decision reason (aspiration level calculation and preference for positive differences) are not explicitly mentioned or implied in the justification provided. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500 Euros more than the aspiration level) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros difference from the aspiration level), we can apply this reason to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the risk of losing in Lottery A and the certainty of gaining a smaller amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B to ensure gaining half of the potential amount from Lottery A (500 Euros), indicating a preference for certainty over the risk of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration, however, focuses on the risk and the certainty of the outcomes rather than explicitly on an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual, however, prefers the certain outcome (Lottery B) over the risky one (Lottery A), which does not directly align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on risk aversion and the desire for certainty, rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money and the possibility of not losing anything. They also considered the certainty of losing money in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred to take the risk of losing more money in order to have a chance of not losing anything, rather than losing a certain amount of money. They also mentioned that knowing they could still have money after the decision made it easier to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention these concepts. However, the individual does consider the possibility of not losing anything, which could be related to the concept of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, and the individual chose Lottery A because it offered a chance of not losing anything, which could be seen as a positive difference. However, the individual's justification is more focused on the risk of losing money and the certainty of losing money in Lottery B, rather than explicitly considering the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20

The individual's verbal report does not provide strong evidence that they used the decision reason to make their choice. While the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is related to the concept of positive differences, it does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2400 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2400 = 3600 and 0 - 2400 = -2400; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2400 = 1600, 2000 - 2400 = -400, and 0 - 2400 = -2400. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in both lotteries and the amount to be won. They noted that Lottery A offers a higher amount with a certain probability, while Lottery B offers two different amounts with different probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a higher amount with a certain probability (25%) and they preferred this over the structure of Lottery B, where they have a 50% chance of winning nothing and the rest of the time they win either 2000 or 4000 Euros. The individual seems to focus on the aspect of not losing money and the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. While the individual does consider the outcomes and their associated probabilities, there's no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from such a level. However, the individual does compare the potential gains and seems to prioritize the higher potential gain in Lottery A, which indirectly might relate to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the higher potential gain in Lottery A and the guaranteed win aspect, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the emphasis on the higher gain could be interpreted as being in line with seeking positive outcomes, albeit not explicitly tied to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes based on their differences from this level. While there are some indirect hints at considering higher gains and thus potentially positive differences, the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not closely follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the individual not using the decision reason, but with some minor considerations that prevent a complete dismissal of its influence."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -4000, and -2000, which equals (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000) / 4 = -3000 / 4 = -750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-750) = -5250 and 0 - (-750) = 750; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-750) = -3250, -2000 - (-750) = -1250, and 0 - (-750) = 750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since only the 0 Euros outcome is positive relative to -750 Euros). In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 50% (since only the 0 Euros outcome is positive relative to -750 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing money (WK nichts zu verlieren) for both lotteries and compared these probabilities. They also considered the question of whether they want to lose money at all.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of not losing money is higher in Lottery A compared to Lottery B. They justified this by stating that the probability of losing something in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, which they found undesirable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities of not losing money and the undesirability of losing money, without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A because it offered a higher probability of not losing money, which aligns with preferring outcomes that are positive relative to a certain threshold (in this case, not losing money), but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's focus on avoiding losses and their comparison of the probabilities of not losing money in each lottery share some conceptual similarity with the decision reason's focus on positive differences relative to an aspiration level, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations required by the decision reason. The individual's decision seems to be more intuitively based on the desire to avoid losses rather than a calculated comparison of probabilities of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as specifically defined, was used by the individual to make the decision. The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not closely match the detailed steps and considerations of the decision reason, despite some superficial similarities in preferring outcomes that avoid losses."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes (5, 5000, 0) is (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 1685 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1685 = -1680 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1685 = 3315 Euros and 0 - 1685 = -1685 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference and a 99.9% probability of a negative difference, while Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference and a 100% probability of a negative difference. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed gain of 5 Euros in Lottery A, the potential gain of 5000 Euros in Lottery B, and the respective probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it provided a guaranteed gain of 5 Euros, which was preferred over the low-probability high gain of Lottery B. The individual also mentioned that a higher probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B might have led to a different choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would theoretically favor Lottery B due to its potential for a large positive difference, albeit with a very low probability. However, the individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of a small gain over the uncertainty of a larger gain, not explicitly on the probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's verbal report does not mention or imply the calculation of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, which are central to the decision reason in question. The individual's decision-making process, as described, focuses on the certainty of a small gain versus the uncertainty of a larger gain, without reference to the specific mechanism outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability (1 in 1000) of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery A and the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose Lottery B to avoid the unnecessary risk of losing 5000 Euros, even though the probability is low, and preferred a certain but smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not directly match the individual's focus on the probability of a significant loss and the preference for avoiding risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on avoiding a significant risk, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences from such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's justification is centered around risk avoidance and the preference for a certain, albeit smaller, loss over a potential larger loss with a very low probability. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (2500) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-3500), while Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1000). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the amounts of money and the risk involved, indicating they considered the potential outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred the certainty of 1500 Euros over the risk of losing 3000 Euros with a 50/50 chance, implying they weighed the risk against the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the risk and the certainty of the outcomes rather than the concept of an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level. The individual also chooses Lottery B but justifies this choice based on risk aversion and the desire for a certain gain, not explicitly on the basis of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not explicitly involve calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes based on their differences from this level. While the individual chooses the same lottery that the decision reason would prefer, the justification provided in the verbal report does not align with the specific rule of the decision reason, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 0. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 0 = 3000, -3000 - 0 = -3000, and 2000 - 0 = 2000. These differences are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the amount between Lottery B and the potential gain of Lottery A, the certainty of the amount in Lottery B, and the potential loss in Lottery A with a 50% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the difference in amount between Lottery B and the potential gain of Lottery A was not significant, but the certainty of the amount in Lottery B was preferred over the risk of losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level. Instead, the individual focuses on the difference in amounts and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B versus the risk in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the avoidance of the risk of loss in Lottery A, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (1000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 Euros and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of Lottery A (100% probability) and the extreme outcomes of Lottery B, noting the high potential gains and losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the safer option (Lottery A) because the extreme differences in Lottery B's outcomes were too great for the given probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of one option and the extremity of outcomes in the other, without explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the safer option due to the extreme outcomes in Lottery B, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus on the certainty of one option and the extremity of outcomes in the other, without explicit consideration of an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences, suggests that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference (as its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the difficulty of the decision, the risk associated with the possible sums of money, and the fact that they would make a different choice with smaller sums. They specifically highlight the height of the possible win or loss sums as their reason for choosing Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice of Lottery B by mentioning that they do not want to take the risk associated with the high possible sums of money in Lottery A, implying that the certainty of 0 Euros is more appealing to them than the risk of losing or gaining a large amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the risk associated with the high sums and the certainty of Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 50% chance of a positive outcome. However, the individual chooses Lottery B, citing risk aversion to high sums, not the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they do not mention or imply the use of an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences in their justification.
