STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a loss chance (Verlustchance) of 1% being practically irrelevant and a chance of 33% being significant. They also mention the risk of getting nothing (leer auszugehen) as nearly ignorable in order to increase their probable gain.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the minimal risk of losing against the potential for a higher gain, indicating that the small risk was worth taking for a potentially higher outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the significance of specific probabilities (1% and 33%) and the concept of risk in relation to potential gain, not explicitly mentioning the range of probabilities or comparing these ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification is based on the perceived value of risk versus potential gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly reference the decision reason's specific criteria of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual chooses Lottery A, which the decision reason would also prefer, the justification provided does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of the probability ranges or their differences as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 34% and the minimum is 0% (implied for the unwritten outcome of not winning), giving a difference of 34%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 33% and the minimum is 0% (implied for the unwritten outcome of not winning), giving a difference of 33%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A because 34% > 33%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low chance of winning in both lotteries, the similarity in the numerical values of the potential winnings, and the trade-off between the potential loss of 100 Euros in winnings versus an increase in the winning chance by one percentage point.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's decision was dominated by the question of whether mitigating the risk of losing (by increasing the chance of winning by 1%) was more valuable than having 100 Euros more in the case of winning, considering the high risk of ending up with nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more about the trade-off between the potential winnings and the increase in probability, rather than the absolute differences in probabilities between the lotteries' outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, which is Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but based on a different rationale—mitigating the risk of losing by slightly increasing the winning chance, rather than directly comparing the differences in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision was made based on a different consideration (the trade-off between increased winning probability and potential winnings) than the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
3,"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first considered applying the opposite logic from a previous decision, which is not directly relevant to the decision reason in question. Then, they isolated the current decision and compared the risk of losing 3000€ in Lottery B (with a 20% chance) to the certainty of 3000€ in Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the risk associated with Lottery B and the preference for a certain outcome over a risky one.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in probabilities between the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the risk of losing 3000€ and the preference for certainty), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. The individual's justification was more focused on the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of Lottery A, rather than the specific rule of comparing the range of probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason's rule does not directly align with the individual's justification for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 25% and the minimum is 0% (implied, as 75% is the probability of getting 0 Euros), so the difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 20% and the minimum is 0% (implied, as 80% is the probability of getting 0 Euros), so the difference is 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison with another lottery scenario (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and emphasizes the importance of significantly increasing the chances of success over maximizing potential gain in a scenario where the outcome is unlikely but realistically possible. This implies the individual considers probabilities and the potential outcomes in their deliberation.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by prioritizing the increase in success chances over the potential gain, especially in scenarios with low probabilities of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the importance of increasing success chances, which relates to probabilities but does not explicitly address the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (25% difference) over Lottery B (20% difference). The individual’s justification emphasizes increasing the chances of success, which could align with preferring a lottery based on probability considerations but does not directly reflect the specific rule of choosing based on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process involves considering probabilities and the potential for increasing success chances, but the verbal report does not directly reflect the specific decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly support the application of the specific rule regarding the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. However, it is not a 0, as the individual does consider probabilities in their decision-making process, indicating some alignment with the general concept of the decision reason, albeit not its specific application."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 55% probability, implying the minimum outcome probability is associated with a 55% chance of not winning) and the maximum probability is 45% (for the 6000 Euros outcome). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 10% probability) and the maximum probability is 90% (for the 3000 Euros outcome). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 45% - 0% = 45% and for Lottery B is 90% - 0% = 90%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case would be Lottery B because 90% > 45%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as ""beinahe garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) and viewed 3000 Euros as a ""ziemlich hoher Gewinnwert"" (pretty high win value). They compared this to the 45% chance of winning in Lottery A, which they seemed to perceive as risky.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) of Lottery B over the riskier option of Lottery A, indicating a preference for a higher probability of winning over a potentially higher reward with lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. While the individual does consider the probabilities, their focus is more on the absolute probability of winning (90% being ""almost guaranteed"") rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, which aligns with choosing Lottery B. The individual also chooses Lottery B but justifies it based on the high probability of winning and the perceived safety of this option, not explicitly mentioning the difference in probabilities between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but their reasoning process as described does not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Thus, while the choice matches, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, implying the chance of not winning is the majority) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for winning 6000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is also 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.8% probability) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between these probabilities for each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 0.1% - 0% = 0.1%, and for Lottery B, it is 0.2% - 0% = 0.2%. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a larger difference (0.2% > 0.1%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries as practically negligible. They also mention the idea that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also overcome a 0.1% chance, implying a consideration of the probability of winning. However, the key factor mentioned is the height of the prize money in case of a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the height of the prize money in case of a win, not directly on the probabilities or their differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, but the individual's justification is based on the prize money, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report indicates a focus on the prize money and the perceived equivalence in overcoming low probabilities, rather than a systematic comparison of probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (-4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between its minimum and maximum probability is 0% (as there's no range). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a 60% difference in probabilities, and Lottery B has a 0% difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the realistic probability of loss and aimed to minimize it. They noted that Lottery A had a chance to give no loss but deemed the 20% probability too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000 Euros compared to the certain loss of Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by focusing on minimizing the realistic probable loss, considering the probability of no loss in Lottery A too low to outweigh the guaranteed loss difference between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (realistic probable loss and the trade-off between the probability of no loss and the amount of loss). The individual's considerations do not directly mention the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as a factor in their decision.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (minimizing realistic probable loss). The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not align, as the individual's decision was based on minimizing loss rather than comparing the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the larger difference. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (60% for A and 50% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the losses and the potential loss amounts, indicating that they weighed the risks of higher losses against the slight differences in probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on their aversion to higher loss amounts, stating that the potential for greater loss was not worth the slight reduction in probability of loss offered by the other option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual. The individual focuses more on the aversion to loss and the comparison of potential losses rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities does not align with the individual's justification, which is centered around loss aversion and the comparison of potential losses rather than the calculation of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a decision-making process based on loss aversion and the comparison of potential losses, without mention or implication of considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (-6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the high loss amounts in both options and the attractive aspect of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice focuses on avoiding the potential for a high loss of 6000 Euros and preferring the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), implying a preference for minimizing risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (high loss amounts, reduction in loss probability), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason would require.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on risk avoidance and the attractiveness of reducing high loss probabilities), the individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual preferred Lottery A, which has a larger difference in probabilities (80% vs 10% for Lottery B), but this preference seems to stem from a desire to avoid high losses rather than explicitly considering the probability differences as per the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, and for Lottery B, they are 0.2% and 99.8%. The differences are 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities of 0.1% and 0.2% and considers them ""ungefähr gleich irrelevant"" (approximately equally irrelevant) for a single trial. They then focus on minimizing the penalty amount in a theoretical worst-case scenario.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aims to minimize the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in case of an unfavorable outcome, implying they are looking at the negative outcomes of the lotteries (-6000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B) to make their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision. Instead, the individual focuses on the irrelevance of the small probabilities and the magnitude of the negative outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on minimizing the penalty amount, not on comparing the probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the outcomes and their implications rather than the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), making the difference 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), making the difference 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to have considered the mathematical value of both options and their personal preference for ensuring a gain over maximizing potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by preferring to ensure an increase in their winnings rather than maximizing the potential for further gain, indicating a preference for certainty over potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of mathematical value and personal preference for certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the desire for certainty, which aligns more with choosing Lottery B due to its 100% probability of winning, not directly because of the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on preferring certainty over maximizing potential gain, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

50% sind immernoch eine relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis. Folglich entschloss ich mich, den absoluten möglichen Verlustwert zu minimieren.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). However, considering the structure of the problem, it seems more appropriate to interpret the decision reason as looking at the range of probabilities associated with any nonzero outcome, thus for Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% for -1000 Euros and 50% for 0 Euros, making the minimum and maximum probabilities both 50%, hence the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, there's only one outcome with 100% probability, so the difference is also 0% since there's no variation in probabilities. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the 50% chance as a relevant factor, indicating they are aware of the probability distribution of at least one of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual justifies their choice by stating they aimed to minimize the absolute possible loss value, which suggests they focused on the potential losses and their magnitudes rather than the probabilities themselves.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (50% chance and minimizing absolute loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (minimizing absolute possible loss), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on their probability differences (as both have a difference of 0%).

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome, but since the outcome is 0, we consider the 75% as the minimum probability for a non-zero outcome, however, for calculation purposes, the minimum is indeed 0%) and the maximum probability is 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome, but since the outcome is 0, we consider the 25% as the maximum probability for a non-zero outcome, however, for calculation purposes, the maximum is indeed 75%), thus the difference is 75% - 0% = 75%.
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome), thus the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.
The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
The individual considered the amounts of money and their probabilities, focusing on the possibility of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual's justification is based on which option gives the higher probability of winning a large amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason requires the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, whereas the individual focused on the probability of winning a large amount, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual prefers the option with the higher probability of winning a large amount.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus was on the probability of large wins rather than the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 50%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for -6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 75%. The difference is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the significance of these losses. They mention that minimizing the chance of loss was a priority due to the massive potential losses in all cases. Second, the individual's justification for their choice was based on prioritizing a 25 percentage point higher chance of not losing anything over reducing the loss amount in the unlikely event of a bad outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (minimizing the chance of loss, prioritizing not losing anything), it seems the individual focused more on the absolute probabilities of losing or not losing rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) with the individual's justification (prioritizing the higher chance of not losing), there doesn't seem to be a direct match. The decision reason would suggest preferring Lottery B due to its larger difference (50% vs. 25%), but the individual's justification hints at preferring Lottery A due to its higher chance of not losing anything (50% vs. 75% chance of losing in B).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 99.8% (or 0.998). For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 99.8% (or 0.998).
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 0.1% probability of winning in Lottery A and considers it ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), indicating they focused on the low probability of the significant win in Lottery A. They also mention preferring a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot, showing consideration of the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for a guaranteed small gain (Lottery B) over the very low probability of a large gain (Lottery A), indicating a risk-averse approach.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration, as expressed, focuses more on the practical irrelevance of the low probability in Lottery A and the value of a guaranteed win in Lottery B, rather than explicitly comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it with a preference for a guaranteed small win, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report and justification for choosing Lottery B do not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's decision seems to be based more on risk aversion and the value of a guaranteed outcome rather than the specific probability differences between the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (for the -5000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A as extremely unattractive initially, which drew them to Option B. However, upon examining the probability distribution in Lottery A, they noted the 0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros is so minimal that the risk is negligible, making a loss of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A by considering the negligible risk of the significant loss due to its extremely low probability, effectively making the guaranteed outcome of 0 Euros the basis for their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the perceived risk and practical guarantee of the outcomes rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but based their decision on the negligible risk of the significant loss and the practical guarantee of not losing anything, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The decision reason is about comparing the range of probabilities between lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the individual's decision-making process. The individual's focus was on the perceived risk and practical outcomes rather than the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well since there is only one probability value. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are both 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical aspects, specifically the expected value (Mittelwert) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 Euros because it has equal chances of adding or subtracting 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 1500 Euros, which is guaranteed due to its 100% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by comparing the expected values and the guarantee of Lottery B, indicating that the guaranteed middle gain of 1500 Euros made the decision straightforward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was based on the expected values and the guarantee of the outcomes, not the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, this reason would not lead to a preference based on the provided rule. The individual, however, preferred Lottery B due to its guaranteed positive outcome, not because of the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it's clear that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the expected outcomes and the guarantee provided by one of the lotteries, rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the decision reason, we need to consider how it would typically handle such cases. The reason seems to prefer lotteries with a larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, implying it looks for variability in outcomes' probabilities. In this specific case, neither lottery offers a difference in probabilities within itself, but Lottery B has a clear distinction in outcomes (a significant gain or loss), whereas Lottery A does not (a guaranteed modest gain). The decision reason's applicability seems to hinge on the interpretation of ""difference"" in a context where one lottery has fixed, certain outcomes and the other has variable, risky outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes the decision is a repeat of a previous one but with the safe option now being more attractive (implying a change in the perceived value of the guaranteed outcome, from 1500 to 2000 Euros). The individual seems to focus on the attractiveness of the safe option and its increase.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision was described as ""selfverständlich"" (obvious or straightforward), indicating the individual found the choice clear without needing extensive deliberation. The focus on the increased attractiveness of the safe option suggests the individual's justification is based on the preference for certainty over risk, especially when the certain option has become more favorable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. However, the individual's deliberation, as described, does not explicitly mention probabilities or their differences. Instead, the focus is on the attractiveness of the certain outcome and its increase.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not directly apply since neither lottery offers a variable probability range within itself. The individual's justification, however, is about the preference for the certain outcome due to its increased attractiveness, not about comparing probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as a factor in their decision-making process. Instead, the focus is on the attractiveness of the guaranteed outcome, suggesting that the decision reason provided was not a factor in their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, so the difference is also 0%. However, since the reason is based on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery, and both lotteries have outcomes with the same probability, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived, but it leads to the same difference (0%) for both lotteries. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery B and compared it to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A, implying they thought about the potential outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that a guaranteed win, although significantly less, is still more than the expected value of the other option, indicating a preference for certainty over potential higher but uncertain gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual instead discusses the guaranteed win and expected values. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not apply directly as intended. The individual's justification, however, is based on the preference for a guaranteed win over an uncertain outcome, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. Instead, the justification provided focuses on the preference for a guaranteed win over potential higher but uncertain gains, which does not align with the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that one of the options (Lottery A) was not a lottery in the traditional sense since it offered a fixed outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), and the other option (Lottery B) carried a risk of losing 6000 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by excluding Lottery B due to the potential loss of 6000 Euros, stating that the probabilities became irrelevant at that point.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was based on the presence of risk (potential loss) in one of the options rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, made a choice based on the presence of risk rather than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the risk associated with one of the options rather than the probability differences, indicating that the decision reason was not used."
