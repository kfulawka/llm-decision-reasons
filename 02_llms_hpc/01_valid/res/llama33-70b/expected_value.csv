To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. 

For Lottery A:
- The outcome of 2500 Euros has a 33% (or 0.33) probability.
- The outcome of 2400 Euros has a 66% (or 0.66) probability.
- The outcome of 0 Euros has a 1% (or 0.01) probability.

Expected Value of Lottery A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01)
Expected Value of Lottery A = 825 + 1584 + 0
Expected Value of Lottery A = 2409 Euros

For Lottery B:
- The outcome of 2400 Euros has a 100% (or 1.00) probability.

Expected Value of Lottery B = 2400 * 1.00
Expected Value of Lottery B = 2400 Euros

Now, we compare the expected values of Lottery A and Lottery B to determine which one the decision reason prefers. 
- The expected value of Lottery A is 2409 Euros.
- The expected value of Lottery B is 2400 Euros.

Since 2409 Euros is greater than 2400 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their respective probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

Next, we calculate the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The formula for the expected value is EV = (outcome1 * probability1) + (outcome2 * probability2) +... for each possible outcome.

For Lottery A:
- Outcome 1: 2500 Euros with 33% probability (or 0.33 in decimal form)
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 67% probability (or 0.67 in decimal form)
Expected Value of A = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros

For Lottery B:
- Outcome 1: 2400 Euros with 34% probability (or 0.34 in decimal form)
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 66% probability (or 0.66 in decimal form)
Expected Value of B = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros

Now, comparing the expected values:
- Expected Value of A = 825 Euros
- Expected Value of B = 816 Euros

Since the expected value of Lottery A is higher than that of Lottery B, according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred.

To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner.

The relevant information for Lottery A is:
- Outcome 1: 6000 Euros with 45% probability
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 55% probability

The relevant information for Lottery B is:
- Outcome 1: 3000 Euros with 90% probability
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 10% probability

We can proceed to calculate the expected value for each lottery.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. 

For Lottery A:
EV_A = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros

For Lottery B:
EV_B = (3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros

Since the expected values of both lotteries are equal (EV_A = EV_B = 2700 Euros), the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.

To apply the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery, we first need to calculate the expected value of both Lottery A and Lottery B.

1. **Calculate the expected value of Lottery A**: The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. For Lottery A, the calculation is as follows:
   - EV_A = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2)
   - EV_A = -3200 + 0
   - EV_A = -3200 Euros

2. **Calculate the expected value of Lottery B**: Since Lottery B has a 100% chance of resulting in -3000 Euros, its expected value is simply -3000 Euros.
   - EV_B = -3000 * 1
   - EV_B = -3000 Euros

3. **Compare the expected values**: Now, we compare the expected values of Lottery A and Lottery B to determine which one the decision reason prefers.
   - EV_A = -3200 Euros
   - EV_B = -3000 Euros
   Since -3000 Euros is greater than -3200 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the outcomes and their probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

Next, we calculate the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The formula for the expected value is EV = (outcome1 * probability1) + (outcome2 * probability2) +... for each possible outcome and its probability.

For Lottery A:
- The outcome of -4000 Euros has a 20% (or 0.20) probability.
- The outcome of 0 Euros has an 80% (or 0.80) probability.
So, EV_A = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800.

For Lottery B:
- The outcome of -3000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability.
- The outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% (or 0.75) probability.
So, EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750.

Now, applying the decision reason, we compare the expected values of the two lotteries. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. Since -750 (EV_B) is greater than -800 (EV_A), Lottery B has a higher expected value.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products.

For Lottery A:
- The outcome of 6000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability.
- The outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% (or 0.75) probability.
So, the expected value of Lottery A (EVA) is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros.

For Lottery B:
- The outcome of 4000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability.
- The outcome of 2000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability.
- The outcome of 0 Euros has a 50% (or 0.50) probability.
So, the expected value of Lottery B (EVB) is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Euros.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. 

For Lottery A:
- The outcome -6000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability, so its contribution to the expected value is -6000 * 0.25.
- The outcome 0 Euros has a 75% (or 0.75) probability, so its contribution to the expected value is 0 * 0.75 = 0.
Thus, the expected value of Lottery A, EV_A, is -6000 * 0.25 + 0 * 0.75 = -1500 Euros.

For Lottery B:
- The outcome -4000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability, so its contribution to the expected value is -4000 * 0.25.
- The outcome -2000 Euros has a 25% (or 0.25) probability, so its contribution to the expected value is -2000 * 0.25.
- The outcome 0 Euros has a 50% (or 0.5) probability, so its contribution to the expected value is 0 * 0.5 = 0.
Thus, the expected value of Lottery B, EV_B, is -4000 * 0.25 - 2000 * 0.25 + 0 * 0.5 = -1000 - 500 = -1500 Euros.
