STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated using the formula EV = (Outcome1 * Probability1) + (Outcome2 * Probability2) +... for each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV can be calculated as (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01), and for Lottery B, the EV is simply 2400 * 1.00 since there's only one outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can indeed be derived from the lotteries, and we can proceed to calculate these values:
- For Lottery A: EV_A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros.
- For Lottery B: EV_B = 2400 * 1 = 2400 Euros.
Since the expected values can be calculated and compared, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""Verlustchance von 1%"" (1% chance of loss) which is considered ""praktisch irrelevant"" (practically irrelevant), and a ""Chance von 33%"" (33% chance) which is considered ""signifikant"" (significant). This indicates the individual is considering the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating the minimal risk (1% chance of losing) is worth taking to increase their probable gain, implying a consideration of the trade-off between risk and potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the concept of risk vs. gain): While the individual discusses probabilities and risk, there is no direct mention of calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (taking a minimal risk for a higher probable gain): The individual's justification aligns with the principle of seeking a higher gain but does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or choosing based on which lottery has the higher expected value.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's reasoning touches upon elements related to the decision reason (consideration of probabilities and seeking higher gain), it does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. The individual's justification is more intuitive and risk-based rather than a direct comparison of expected monetary outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's verbal report does not directly mention or imply the calculation or comparison of expected values, which is the core of the decision reason provided. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does consider aspects (like probabilities and potential gains) that are related to the concept of expected value, even if not explicitly calculated or compared in the traditional sense of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 2400 * 0.34 + 0 * 0.66 = 816 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 2500 * 0.33 + 0 * 0.67 = 825 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but deemed it not entirely unrealistic. They focused on the trade-off between the potential loss of 100 Euros in the prize money and the increase in the winning chance by one percentage point. The individual's justification for their choice was that mitigating the risk of losing was more valuable than having 100 Euros more in the case of a win.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (trade-off between the loss in prize money and the increase in winning chance), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the lotteries. Instead, they focused on a specific aspect of the lotteries (the trade-off between the prize money and the winning probability). The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not directly align with the individual's justification (mitigating the risk of losing was more valuable). However, the individual's reasoning about the trade-off between risk and reward indirectly touches upon the concept of evaluating the lotteries based on their outcomes and probabilities, albeit not in the exact manner the decision reason prescribes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision-making process shares some elements with the decision reason (consideration of outcomes and probabilities), it does not directly apply the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus on risk mitigation and the specific trade-off between prize money and winning probability suggests a different reasoning path than the one outlined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is 3000 * 1 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and compared it to the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, although small (20%), was not negligible, leading them to prefer the certain outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B and the certainty of Lottery A). The individual's consideration does not directly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focuses on the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding the risk of losing 3000 Euros). The individual’s justification is based on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of expected values. The decision reason would have led to preferring Lottery B due to its higher expected value, but the individual chose Lottery A due to risk considerations.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus on avoiding risk and ensuring a certain gain, rather than comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, indicates that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, where EV = (outcome * probability). For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.25) = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.20) = 800 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, we can apply the decision reason to this problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison with another lottery scenario (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and discusses the preference for significantly increasing the chances of success over maximizing potential gain in a situation where the lottery is unlikely but realistically possible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice based on the preference for increasing the chances of success (Erfolgschancen signifikant zu steigern) rather than maximizing the potential gain (potentiellen Gewinn zu maximieren).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual discusses the preference for increasing success chances over maximizing gain, which does not directly align with comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, whereas the individual’s justification focuses on increasing the chances of winning rather than directly comparing expected monetary outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus is more on the probability of winning rather than the expected monetary value of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, where EV = (probability of winning * amount to win) + (probability of losing * amount lost). For Lottery A, EV = (0.45 * 6000) + (0.55 * 0) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (0.90 * 3000) + (0.10 * 0) = 2700 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for this reason is the probability and outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the given data.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as ""beinahe garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) and noted that 3000 Euros is a ""ziemlich hoher Gewinnwert"" (pretty high win value). They also considered the 45% chance of winning in Lottery A as a risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because its high probability of winning made it the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) for a win, as opposed to risking everything on a 45% chance with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's justification focuses on the probability of winning and the perceived safety of the choice, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal expected values, but the individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher perceived safety, not because of a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery B was based on the perceived safety and high probability of winning, rather than a comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value to make a decision and the individual's justification does not align with this rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 6 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of winning in both lotteries to be so low that they are practically negligible. They also mention the height of the prize money in case of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the height of the prize money at a stroke of luck, implying they chose the lottery with the higher prize money, assuming they could overcome the low probability of winning either lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is the same for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the probability being negligible and the height of the prize money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the prize money, not the expected value directly.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, especially since the expected values are equal and the individual based their decision on a different criterion (the height of the prize money).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is EV_B = (-3000 * 1) = -3000 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is -3200 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probability of no loss in Lottery A (20%) and the additional loss of 1000 Euros in Lottery A compared to Lottery B if the loss occurs. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual aimed to minimize the realistically probable loss, considering the probability of no loss in Lottery A too low to justify the potential additional loss compared to the certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential losses). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focuses on the realistic probability of loss and the magnitude of potential losses.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (minimizing the realistically probable loss). The decision reason’s rule is based on expected values, while the individual’s justification is based on a more intuitive assessment of risk and potential loss, without explicitly calculating expected values.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion and minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing expected value. However, the outcome of the individual's decision (choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, in this case, Lottery B, because -3000 Euros is greater than -3200 Euros in terms of expected loss) coincidentally aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, but the reasoning process described does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with the outcome the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide evidence that the decision reason (comparing expected values) was explicitly used in the decision-making process. The individual's reasoning was more focused on minimizing probable loss and considering the risk associated with each lottery rather than on the expected values of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery can be calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, EV_A = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses, indicating that higher loss amounts are valued more negatively than gain amounts are valued positively.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating they were not willing to risk a larger loss to reduce the chance of loss by 5 percentage points, implying a focus on the potential losses and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected value calculation based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential losses), it appears the individual focused more on the loss aspect and its probability rather than calculating or directly comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding a larger potential loss), it seems the individual's decision was influenced by the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities but not explicitly by calculating and comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to be more aligned with loss aversion and a qualitative assessment of risk rather than a direct calculation and comparison of expected values as the decision reason prescribes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the high loss amounts in both options and the attractiveness of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%. Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on avoiding the potential for a higher loss of 6000 Euros, indicating a preference for the ""sichere Route"" (safer route), which implies avoiding the higher potential loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (high loss amounts, probability of loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the lotteries. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (avoiding the higher potential loss), there is a discrepancy since the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual chose based on risk avoidance rather than expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -6 Euros for both lotteries. This means both lotteries have the same expected value, making the decision reason's rule indifferent between the two.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the probabilities of 0.1% and 0.2% as ""ungefähr gleich irrelevant"" (approximately equally irrelevant) for a single trial, indicating they downplay the significance of these small probabilities. Second, the individual's justification for their choice is to minimize the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in a theoretical unfortunate case, implying they focus on the potential loss amount rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities being approximately equally irrelevant and minimizing the penalty amount), it's clear the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (minimizing the penalty amount), it's evident the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual did not mention or imply calculating or comparing expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 * 1) = 500 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to have considered the mathematical value (possibly referring to expected value) of both options and found them to be equal. They also considered their current situation and the desire to ensure an increase in their winnings.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring to ensure their winnings increased, rather than maximizing the potential for further winnings. This implies a preference for a certain gain over a gamble with the same expected value but higher potential upside.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical equality of the options, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on expected values. However, they also considered other factors like ensuring an increase in winnings, which is not directly related to the expected value comparison.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, indicates a preference for certainty (Lottery B) over the gamble (Lottery A), which is not directly based on the expected value comparison but on risk preference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual considered the mathematical equality of the options, which suggests some alignment with the decision reason. However, their justification for choosing one lottery over the other was based more on the desire for certainty and ensuring an increase in winnings rather than strictly on which lottery had the higher expected value. Since both lotteries had the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's choice was swayed by factors not directly related to expected value comparison. Thus, while there is some overlap, the decision reason does not fully capture the individual's decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-500 * 1) = -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the 50% chance of an outcome as relevant and focuses on minimizing the absolute possible loss value.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to minimize the absolute possible loss value, implying a focus on the worst-case scenario or the maximum loss that could be incurred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual discusses probabilities and minimizing loss, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, focuses on minimizing the absolute possible loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it has a fixed loss of 500 Euros, whereas Lottery A has a potential loss of 1000 Euros, even though the expected loss is the same for both.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on minimizing the absolute possible loss value and the lack of explicit consideration of expected values in the verbal report suggest that the decision reason, which is based on comparing the expected values of the lotteries, was not used by the individual to make the decision. The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value, especially since the expected values are equal and the individual's justification is based on a different criterion (minimizing maximum loss)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the expected value is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of money (noting all were four-digit and thus significant) and the probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual based their decision on which option gave them a higher probability of winning a large amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (amounts of money and probability of winning a large amount): The individual does not mention considering the expected value explicitly but focuses on the probability of winning a significant amount.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring the option with a higher probability of winning a large amount): The decision reason and the individual's justification do not align because the individual's focus was on the probability of winning any large amount, not on the overall expected value of the lotteries.

The decision reason, which is based on the expected value of the lotteries, does not match the individual's justification for their choice, which was based on the probability of winning a large amount. This indicates that the individual did not use the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1000 - 500 + 0 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 + 0 = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived, and in this case, both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the importance of minimizing the chance of loss, specifically focusing on the difference in the probability of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized the higher chance of not losing (by 25 percentage points) over reducing the amount of loss in the unlikely event of a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on minimizing the chance of loss and the difference in probabilities of not losing, not on the expected monetary value of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification was based on minimizing the risk of loss, not on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus was on minimizing the risk of loss and the probability of not losing, rather than on the expected value of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (5 Euros * 100%) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability (0.1%) of winning in Lottery A and considers it ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), implying they downplay the significance of the high-value, low-probability outcome. They express a preference for a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for a guaranteed small gain (Lottery B) over the remote chance of a large gain (Lottery A), describing the latter as an ""Illusion auf einen Jackpot"" (illusion of a jackpot). This suggests they prioritize certainty over potential.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. However, the individual's considerations focus more on the guarantee of a small win versus the improbability of a large win, rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual, however, shows a clear preference for Lottery B based on the guarantee it offers, not because it has a higher expected value (since they are equal), but because of the certainty of the outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, since their justification is based on the preference for a guaranteed outcome rather than a comparison of expected values. The individual's focus on certainty versus uncertainty, rather than on the expected monetary value, indicates that the decision reason based on expected value was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5. For Lottery B, the expected value is -5 * 1 = -5. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -5 for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A as extremely unattractive, which initially drew them to Option B. Then, they considered the probability distribution in Lottery A, noting that the 0.1% chance of losing is so small that the risk is negligible, and a loss of 0€ is practically guaranteed.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by stating that, without realistic risk, they chose Lottery A because the risk of losing in Lottery A was considered negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (loss amount, probability distribution, and perceived risk), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the negligible risk of losing in Lottery A), it seems that the individual's decision was based more on the perceived risk and less on the expected value calculation. The individual's reasoning about the risk being ""vernachlässigbar"" (negligible) and the outcome of 0€ being ""praktisch garantiert"" (practically guaranteed) does not directly align with calculating and comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of expected values to compare the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus was on the perceived risk and the practical guarantee of not losing in Lottery A, rather than on calculating and comparing the expected outcomes of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1500 * 1) = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, specifically highlighting that Lottery A has a 50% chance of adding or subtracting 3000 Euros, resulting in a ""Mittelwert"" (average value) of 0 Euros over many attempts. For Lottery B, they note a guaranteed (""100%-Chance"") gain of 1500 Euros.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by comparing the average gain of both lotteries, stating that Lottery B offers a guaranteed middle gain of 1500 Euros, which made the decision straightforward due to the lack of risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, outcomes, and the concept of a ""Mittelwert"" or average value over many attempts). The individual's consideration aligns with the information needed to calculate expected values, as they discuss the long-term average outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring Lottery B due to its guaranteed positive average gain compared to the zero average gain of Lottery A). The individual's justification directly aligns with the rule of preferring the option with the higher expected value, as they essentially choose the lottery with the higher average gain (Lottery B over Lottery A).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, with 2000 Euros at 100% probability, the EV is 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The report mentions a comparison between a risky option (3000/-3000 with 50/50 probability) and a guaranteed option (implied to be 2000 Euros, as per the problem statement, but mistakenly mentioned as 1500 Euros in the report). The individual notes the guaranteed option is now more attractive.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision was described as ""selfverständlich"" (obvious), implying the choice was clear and straightforward due to the attractiveness of the guaranteed option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the guaranteed option over the risky one, which aligns with comparing expected values, as the guaranteed option (Lottery A) indeed has a higher expected value than the risky option (Lottery B).
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, and the individual chose the guaranteed option, which has a higher expected value, indicating the decision aligns with the reason’s rule. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values, but the choice and justification imply an intuitive understanding or application of the concept.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment is based on the alignment between the decision reason's preference for the higher expected value and the individual's choice of the guaranteed option, which has a higher expected value. While the report does not explicitly mention expected values, the individual's justification implies an understanding that aligns with the decision reason, though not with complete certainty as the calculation or explicit mention of expected values is absent."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (1000 * 1) = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an expected value of 0 Euros and Lottery B has an expected value of 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery B and compared it to the ""Mittelwert"" (average or expected value) of Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that while a guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros is significantly less than the potential gain from Lottery A, it is still more than the average value of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (referred to as ""Mittelwert"") of Lottery A and the guaranteed gain of Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification implies a preference for Lottery B because its guaranteed gain is more than the expected value of Lottery A, which aligns with preferring the option with the higher expected value (since 1000 Euros is greater than 0 Euros).

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 Euros (0 * 1). For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the risk of Lottery B, specifically the potential loss of 6000 Euros, and the fact that Lottery A is not a lottery but a certain outcome. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was that the potential loss in Lottery B led to its exclusion, regardless of the probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) does not seem to be directly considered by the individual, who focused on the risk of loss in Lottery B rather than calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) does not align with the individual's justification (excluding Lottery B due to the risk of loss, regardless of expected value). Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's process does not reflect a consideration of expected values.
