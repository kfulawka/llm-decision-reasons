STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To calculate the expected value, we need to know the outcomes and their respective probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) can be calculated as follows: EV_A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01). For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is simply 2400 * 1.00, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can indeed be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Calculating the expected values:
- EV_A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros
- EV_B = 2400 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of 100 Euros more with Lottery A (comparing 2500 Euros to 2400 Euros), the probability of gaining this extra amount (1/3 or 33%), and the risk of getting nothing with a 1% chance. The individual also considered the guaranteed 2400 Euros from Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because the potential extra gain of 100 Euros with Lottery A did not outweigh the risk of getting nothing, even though the risk was only 1%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves considering all outcomes and their probabilities. The individual focused on the difference in potential gain and the specific risk of getting nothing, rather than calculating or directly comparing the overall expected values of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification, however, was based on the perceived risk and the value of the potential extra gain, not explicitly on which lottery had the higher expected value. The individual chose the lottery with the guaranteed outcome, suggesting a risk-averse approach rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision aligns with preferring a more certain outcome (which could be related to expected value considerations), the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly mention calculating or comparing expected values. The focus was more on the risk associated with the potential higher gain and the guarantee of the other option.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are EV_A = 816 Euros and EV_B = 825 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference in winnings (""Der Gewinnunterschied lag nur bei 100 Euro"") and the difference in probabilities (""ein Prozent mehr Wahrscheinlichkeit""). This indicates the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers ""ein Prozent mehr Wahrscheinlichkeit einen etwas kleineren Betrag zu gewinnen, als das es 1 Prozent wahrscheinlicher ist, dass ich gar nichts gewinne."" This suggests the individual is weighing the trade-off between the probability of winning a smaller amount versus the risk of winning nothing, focusing on the marginal differences in probability and outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (differences in outcomes and probabilities): While the individual discusses differences in outcomes and probabilities, there is no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring a slightly higher probability of winning a smaller amount over a slightly lower probability of winning nothing): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the marginal trade-offs rather than the overall expected value.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus is more on the marginal differences in probability and outcome rather than on calculating and comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward: 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the EV of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the risk of losing (20% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B) and equates this risk to potentially losing 3000 Euros, which they could have securely gained from Lottery A. This indicates the individual is focusing on the potential loss associated with the risk in Lottery B rather than directly comparing expected values. Second, the individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by preferring the certain but lower gain over the higher potential gain in Lottery B due to the perceived high loss chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with what the individual considered (the risk of loss in Lottery B and the certainty of gain in Lottery A), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values. Instead, they focused on the risk aspect and the certainty of the outcomes. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty over potential higher gain due to risk aversion), it's clear the individual's decision process was more aligned with risk aversion rather than a straightforward comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The focus on risk aversion and the certainty of outcomes, rather than a direct comparison of expected values, indicates the decision reason was not used by the individual."
4,"innhöhe abzuwiegen. Die Entscheidung viel auch hier wieder zugunsten der höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit als für den höheren Gewinn bei niedrigerer Wahrscheinlichkeit.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 * 0.25 = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 4000 * 0.20 = 800 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 750 Euros for Lottery A and 800 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both options have no loss possibility, which is a positive aspect. They also weighed the higher probability against the gain height, indicating they considered both the probabilities and the outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided in favor of the higher probability over the higher gain at a lower probability, suggesting their decision was based on a trade-off between the likelihood of winning and the amount that could be won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered probabilities and outcomes, which are components of expected value but not the calculated expected value itself.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification emphasizes the importance of higher probability over higher gain at lower probability, which does not directly align with choosing based on expected value. The individual's focus was more on the trade-off between probability and outcome rather than calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly indicate the use of expected values to make the decision. While they considered probabilities and outcomes, the emphasis on the trade-off between these factors rather than a direct comparison of expected values suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not the primary basis for their choice. However, since probabilities and outcomes were considered, there is a slight indication that some aspect of the decision reason might have been intuitively applied, hence a score slightly above 0."
5,",5 von 100 die 6000 Euro gewinnen, aber 9 von 10 die 3000 Euro hat mich wieder zu Option A und somit zum niedrigeren aber wahrscheinlichren Gewinn gebracht.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 Euros * 0.9) + (0 Euros * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 2700 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the significant difference in potential winnings and the probabilities of winning, specifically mentioning the probability of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B (45%) and the probability of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A (90%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because, despite the higher potential reward of Lottery B, the higher probability of winning a lesser amount in Lottery A was more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities and the potential winnings rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the higher probability of a lesser gain, not explicitly on the basis of expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning and the potential gain rather than on calculating and comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would not provide a basis for preference, but the individual's justification does not reflect a consideration of expected values as the basis for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"Euro doppelt so hoch zu gewinnen im Vergleich zu den 6000 Euro.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated by multiplying the outcome by its probability and summing these products for each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 * 0.002 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 6000 * 0.001 = 6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning (0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B) and the amounts to be won (3000 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it offers a higher probability of winning, even though the amount is lower, and explicitly mentions that the probability of winning 3000 Euros is twice as high as winning 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the comparison of probabilities and the preference for a higher chance of winning a lower amount, not directly on expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual chose based on the probability of winning, not the expected value, indicating a different decision criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision was based on the comparison of probabilities and the preference for a higher chance of winning, rather than on the expected values of the lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as -3000 Euros * 100% = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is calculated as (-4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = -3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -3000 Euros for Lottery A and -3200 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to misunderstand the probabilities and outcomes of Lottery B, mentioning a ""Wahl zwischen -1000 Euro oder +3000"" (choice between -1000 Euros or +3000 Euros), which does not match the actual outcomes of -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The individual also mentions a ""+3000 Euro-Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (probability of +3000 Euros) as 1/5, which again does not align with the provided probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to take the risk because the perceived probability of the better outcome is ""hoch genug"" (high enough), indicating a subjective evaluation of risk rather than a calculation of expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual's understanding of the lotteries does not match the actual information needed to calculate the expected values. The decision reason requires accurate expected values, but the individual's perceptions are based on incorrect or misunderstood outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on a subjective evaluation of risk and a misinterpretation of the probabilities and outcomes, not on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a misunderstanding of the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities and a decision-making process based on subjective risk evaluation rather than calculation of expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of the product of each outcome and its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. Since the expected values can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing in Lottery A (20%) and compared it to the probability difference between the two lotteries, mentioning a ""5% Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied"" which seems to refer to the difference in probabilities of winning or losing (25% for B vs. 20% for A, thus a 5% difference). They also considered the potential loss amount of 1000 Euros more in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the 20% probability of losing in Lottery A was too high, especially considering the additional 1000 Euros potential loss compared to Lottery B, and that a larger probability difference might have led to a different decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves considering the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the comparison of probabilities and potential losses rather than directly comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The verbal report indicates a focus on probability and potential loss rather than a direct comparison of expected values, suggesting that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice. However, the consideration of probabilities and outcomes leaves a small possibility that expected values were implicitly considered, thus the assessment is not a complete zero."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery, was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and it shows both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the significant difference in the sums of the losses and the high probability of losing in Lottery B, as well as the near 50:50 chance of incurring an additional 3000 Euros in debt in Lottery A. Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the perceived risk and the specific probabilities of losing, indicating a concern for the potential loss amount and its likelihood.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (differences in sums, probabilities of loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the lotteries in their decision-making process as described. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not align with the individual's justification, which focuses more on the risk of additional debt and the specific probabilities rather than the overall expected value of each lottery.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of the higher loss in both lotteries and compared them, noting that the probability of the -3000 Euro loss is twice as high as the probability of the -6000 Euro loss, but also acknowledged that the chance of receiving the higher loss (-6000 Euros) is only half as high as the chance of receiving the -3000 Euro loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing the lottery with the higher potential loss (-3000 Euros) by considering the trade-off between the size of the loss and its probability, indicating a willingness to take on a higher loss in exchange for a higher probability of that loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the expected value, which is based on the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered the probabilities and the outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification is based on a trade-off between the probability and the size of the loss, not explicitly on which lottery has a higher expected value. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value (-6), if the individual was following the decision reason, they should be indifferent between the two lotteries or acknowledge that they are equivalent in terms of expected value, which is not explicitly stated in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered relevant factors (outcomes and probabilities), they did not explicitly apply the decision reason of comparing expected values to make their choice. The verbal report suggests a different rationale for the decision, focusing on the trade-off between loss size and probability rather than expected value comparison."

Selbe Begründung wie bei der Aufgabe hier vor. Zustzlich gab es hier keine Verlustmöglichkeit, was mich noch mehr zu A gedrängt hat.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The expected value of Lottery A is (1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 500 Euros, and the expected value of Lottery B is (500 * 1) = 500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are equal in this case.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual mentions that there was no loss possibility in one of the options (which seems to be a reference to Lottery B, as it has a 100% chance of a gain), but this statement seems to be contradictory because they mention it ""drängt hat"" (urged) them towards Lottery A, despite the fact that Lottery B is the one without a loss possibility. The justification for the choice seems to be focused on the absence of a loss possibility, but the report does not clearly discuss the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (absence of loss possibility), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on the absence of a loss possibility). However, since the expected values of the two lotteries are equal, the decision reason would not provide a clear preference between the two options, which might explain why the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the decision reason could have been applied, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual used the expected value calculation to make their decision. The individual's justification seems to focus on a different aspect (absence of loss possibility), and there's no direct mention of comparing expected values. However, the equal expected values of the two lotteries mean that the decision reason wouldn't have provided a clear guidance, which is why the assessment is not 0."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. 
- For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: (0.5 * -1000) + (0.5 * 0) = -500 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the expected value is: (1 * -500) = -500 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same expected value of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being somewhat risk-tolerant (""Risikofreudiger"") and compares the risk of a 50:50 outcome for Lottery A to the certain outcome of Lottery B, framing the options as +500 or -500 Euros for Lottery A, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the actual outcomes provided (-1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability for Lottery A, and -500 Euros with 100% probability for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on a ""spontane Gefühlsentscheidung"" (spontaneous emotional decision), indicating that the decision was more intuitive or based on feelings rather than a calculated approach like expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk tolerance, misframed outcomes, and emotional response): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (spontaneous emotional decision based on risk tolerance and a misinterpretation of the options): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values in making the decision, and the justification provided does not align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. The decision seems to have been made based on risk tolerance and emotional factors rather than a calculated comparison of expected outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, showing both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning something in each lottery, noting that Lottery B offers a 50% chance of winning something, whereas Lottery A only offers a 25% chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a higher overall probability of winning something, even if the potential winnings are not as high as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (overall probability of winning): The individual focused on the probability of winning something, not the expected value of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (prefer the lottery with the higher probability of winning something): The decision reason and the individual’s justification are based on different criteria. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule of maximizing expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is calculated as: (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1000 - 500 + 0 = -1500 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is calculated as: (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 + 0 = -1500 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as both lotteries having an expected value of -1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the monetary outcomes of both lotteries and their respective probabilities, focusing on the potential losses and the chances of those losses occurring.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual initially compared the potential losses, preferring fewer losses. Then, they considered the probabilities of incurring losses, noting that Lottery B has a lower chance of loss. However, the decisive factor seemed to be the overall probability distribution, especially the 75% chance of either breaking even or losing only 2000 Euros with Lottery A, leading them to choose Option A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, but the individual's deliberation, as described, emphasizes the comparison of potential losses and the probabilities of those losses without explicitly calculating or mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same expected value. In contrast, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on a preference for the risk profile of Lottery A over Lottery B, particularly focusing on the probability of losing less or breaking even.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not explicitly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, since the individual did not mention calculating or comparing expected values and instead focused on the potential losses and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (5 Euros * 100%) = 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the absence of loss risk in Lottery A, the high potential gain in Lottery A, and the relatively low certain gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because of its potential for a high gain without loss risk, compared to the low certain gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focused on the potential for high gain without risk in Lottery A versus the certain but low gain in Lottery B.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification: Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as it emphasizes the potential for high gain and absence of loss risk rather than the expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, especially since the expected values are equal and the individual's justification is based on other factors (potential gain and absence of loss risk)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is -5 Euros with 100% probability, so its EV is also -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the magnitude of potential losses, specifically comparing the loss of -5 Euros in Lottery B to the -5000 Euros in Lottery A, focusing on the aspect of debt and the ability to pay it.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the loss is smaller and more manageable, implying a preference for avoiding large debts over smaller, more certain losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries. However, the individual focuses on the magnitude of potential losses and the manageability of debt, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual, however, prefers Lottery B due to the smaller and more manageable loss, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule of choosing based on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the magnitude of potential losses and debt manageability, rather than the expected values of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers expected values and the individual's decision process does not align with this rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (1500 * 1) = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities provided. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the significant difference in potential gains but focuses on the risk of losing 3000 Euros with a 50% probability as a significant deterrent.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies not choosing Lottery A because the risk of losing 3000 Euros was too high for the potential gain of 1500 Euros more (implied comparison to the guaranteed 1500 Euros from Lottery B).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual: The individual discusses the risk and potential gain but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification: The individual's justification is based on the risk associated with one of the lotteries rather than a direct comparison of expected values. However, the decision to avoid Lottery A due to its potential loss and the preference for the guaranteed gain of Lottery B indirectly aligns with the concept of preferring a more certain, positive outcome, which in this case happens to have a higher expected value.

Given these comparisons, while the individual does not explicitly discuss expected values, their decision-making process seems to lean towards risk aversion and preferring a certain gain over a risky option with a potentially higher but equally likely loss. This aligns somewhat with the decision reason's preference for the higher expected value, but it's based on risk perception rather than explicit expected value calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used as described, primarily because the individual's verbal report focuses on risk aversion and perceived value rather than explicitly calculating and comparing expected values. However, the choice does align with the outcome the decision reason would suggest, albeit for reasons not directly related to expected value calculations."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 2000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery B and the 50:50 chance of gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros from Lottery A. They also consider the difference in potential gains and the risk involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential gain from Lottery A is not worth the risk of losing 3000 Euros, and that 2000 Euros is a significant amount of money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the guaranteed gain, the risk, and the potential gains, but does not explicitly calculate or mention expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, but it is based on a risk assessment and the perceived value of the guaranteed gain, rather than an explicit calculation of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification do not explicitly involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason regarding expected values. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward: 1000 Euros with 100% probability, so EV_A = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an expected value of 1000 Euros and Lottery B has an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""Gewinnunterschied"" (difference in winnings), which could imply a consideration of the potential outcomes, and ""hohe Verlustchance"" (high chance of loss), indicating an awareness of the probabilities involved. They also mention that ""1000 Euro sind immer noch viel Geld"" (1000 Euros is still a lot of money), showing an appreciation for the certain gain offered by Lottery A.

Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be deterred by the ""hohe Verlustchance"" of Lottery B, suggesting a risk-averse stance, and is attracted to the certainty of gaining 1000 Euros from Lottery A. The justification revolves around the risk associated with Lottery B and the value of the certain gain from Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries. While the individual discusses aspects that could relate to expected value (e.g., the difference in winnings, the high chance of loss), they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification, however, is more aligned with a risk-averse preference for a certain gain over a gamble with a high chance of loss, rather than an explicit comparison of expected values.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value based on calculated expected values. The individual's focus is more on the risk associated with one of the options and the value of certainty, rather than an explicit calculation and comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as defined by the calculation and comparison of expected values to choose the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual. The individual's justification is more closely related to risk aversion and the value of a certain outcome rather than an explicit consideration of expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery B, the EV is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery A, the EV is (0 * 1) = 0. Therefore, both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a ""50:50 chance"" which refers to the probability distribution of Lottery B, indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes. They also mention ""die Hohe Summe von 6000 Euro"" (the high sum of 6000 Euros), showing they considered the magnitude of the potential gain and loss in Lottery B.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states they chose Option A because they preferred not to win or lose anything, given the high stakes of Lottery B. This suggests their decision was influenced by the potential for loss and the certainty of not losing with Option A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes of Lottery B). While the individual considered elements that could lead to calculating expected values, there's no direct mention of comparing expected values between the two lotteries.

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding potential loss). Since both lotteries have the same expected value of 0, the decision reason would suggest indifference between the two options. However, the individual's justification focuses on avoiding risk rather than comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision was more influenced by risk aversion (avoiding the potential loss) than by a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries.
