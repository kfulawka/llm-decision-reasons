STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing and the potential for the same or more gain as Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they assessed the probability of winning nothing as low and preferred the possibility of the same or more gain than Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of mean outcomes based on all possible outcomes of the lotteries, but the individual's consideration is focused on the probability of winning nothing and the potential gain in comparison to Lottery A, without mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the perceived low probability of winning nothing and the potential for higher gain, not on comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus on the probability of winning nothing and the potential for higher gain does not indicate the use of the mean outcome calculation as the basis for their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities between Lottery A and Lottery B and the potential gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher potential gain because the probabilities were very similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (similar probabilities and higher gain): The individual considered the higher gain, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher mean outcome, but the individual's focus was on the similarity of probabilities and the highest single outcome rather than the calculated mean.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose the lottery with the higher potential gain due to similar probabilities): The individual's justification aligns with preferring a higher outcome but does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the mean of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report indicates a preference for the higher gain when probabilities are similar, which aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring the higher mean outcome). However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating the mean of the outcomes as the basis for the decision, suggesting that while the decision might align with the reason's outcome, the process described does not perfectly match the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with uncertainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The mean outcome for Lottery A is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery B and the possibility of losing with Lottery A, as well as the difference in winnings between the two lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the attractiveness of the certain win with Lottery B and the insufficient difference in winnings between Lottery A and B to justify the risk of losing with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning, possibility of losing, and difference in winnings) shows that the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) with the individual's justification (preference for certainty and insufficient difference in winnings to justify risk) indicates that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual focuses on the certainty of the outcome and the risk of losing rather than on the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries and the potential winnings, noting that the probability difference between A and B was too small, and they could win more with A at a similar probability to B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the potential winnings and the perceived similarity in probabilities, rather than an explicit calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential winnings and the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the potential winnings and the perceived similarity in probabilities, not the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The focus on probabilities and potential winnings without mention of calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason suggests that this specific reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1500 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the higher gain and the lower probability of achieving it in one of the lotteries, implying they looked at the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the ""höheren Gewinn"" (higher gain), indicating they prioritized the outcome amount over the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated without considering probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities): The individual considered outcomes but also their probabilities, which is not in line with the decision reason that ignores probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the higher gain despite lower probability): While the individual chose based on the higher gain, this aligns with preferring Lottery A, as did the decision reason, but the reasoning process described does not directly match calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the higher gain aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), but the process described (considering probabilities and focusing on the direct comparison of gains rather than a calculated mean) does not directly align with the decision reason's method of calculating mean outcomes without considering probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the described decision-making process does not closely match the specific method outlined by the decision reason, indicating it is unlikely the decision reason was used as described."

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to this reason, Lottery A is preferred because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of not winning in both lotteries and noticed they are almost equal. They also considered the potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher potential win because, given similar probabilities of winning, they preferred the option that offers twice the amount of the other if they were to win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the potential winnings and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual preferred the lottery with the higher potential win given similar probabilities, which aligns with preferring higher outcomes but does not explicitly calculate or compare means.

Given these comparisons, the individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the higher potential win aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring higher outcomes), but the specific calculation and focus on mean outcomes as described in the decision reason are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the preference for higher outcomes, the exact method of calculating and comparing means as the basis for the decision is not clearly evident in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -2000 is greater than -3000. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference in potential losses between Lottery A and Lottery B and the probability of losing nothing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because the potential loss difference between the two lotteries is not significant enough to outweigh the preference for the small chance of not losing anything in Lottery A, rather than the certainty of losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of the difference in potential losses and the preference for avoiding a certain loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the preference for a chance to avoid loss rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the individual focuses on the avoidance of certain loss and the potential for no loss, rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-2000 Euros), according to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss in both lotteries and the difference in probabilities (5% difference between the probabilities of losing in the two lotteries).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because they lose less in Lottery B, despite the slightly higher probability of losing, and they seem to prioritize minimizing the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential loss and the difference in probabilities, not the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B in this case. The individual also chooses Lottery B but justifies it by the amount of loss and the probability difference, not by comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (both prefer Lottery B), but the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The individual focuses on loss and probability differences, not mean outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used. However, since the outcome preferred by the individual happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest, there is a small chance that the decision reason was considered, albeit not explicitly mentioned. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a slight possibility of alignment by coincidence."

The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing (i.e., winning 0 Euros) in both lotteries and the potential loss amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a higher probability of not losing (Lottery B), since the potential gain is 0 Euros in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the probability of not losing and the potential loss amount.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with a higher probability of not losing.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability, so the mean is 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual is certain about winning something with Lottery A and perceives the possibility of winning double or losing everything with Lottery B as too uncertain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by emphasizing the certainty of winning something with Lottery A and the perceived uncertainty of the outcomes of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are equal for both lotteries (500 Euros). However, the individual's consideration is centered around the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the uncertainty associated with Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (500 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chooses Lottery A due to its certainty, not because of a comparison of mean outcomes.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual includes the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery A and the comparison of the potential losses between Lottery A and Lottery B. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the potential to avoid loss with Lottery A, even though the loss could be twice as much as with Lottery B if it occurs. The individual seems to value the chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated by simply averaging the outcomes) with that considered by the individual (possibility of not losing, comparison of potential losses), it appears the individual did not focus on calculating mean outcomes as the decision reason does. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome or being indifferent if means are equal) to the individual’s justification (valuing the chance to avoid loss), it seems the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual is not indifferent between the two lotteries based on mean outcomes but rather on the potential to avoid any loss.

For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (6000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2666.67 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of winning something with Lottery A (50%) and compares it to the higher potential loss (or ""ausgehen"") probability with Lottery B. They seem to focus on the guarantee of winning something with Lottery A half of the time, implying a consideration of the outcomes and their probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around the perceived risk or probability of losing (or not winning the higher amount) with Lottery B being too high, and the assurance of winning something with Lottery A, even if it's less than what could be won with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the probability of winning something and the risk of losing.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (mean of 3000 Euros vs. 2666.67 Euros for Lottery A). However, the individual's justification does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes but rather emphasizes the security of winning something with Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was more on the probabilities of winning and losing rather than on the mean values of the outcomes.

For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. We can calculate the mean for each lottery:
- Lottery A mean: (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros
- Lottery B mean: (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros
Since the mean of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), according to this decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything in both lotteries and compared these probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher probability of not losing anything, which in this case seems to favor Lottery A because it has a higher probability (75%) of resulting in 0 Euros (not losing anything) compared to Lottery B's 50% chance of resulting in 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered the probabilities of not losing anything.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification leads to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher probability of not losing anything.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the probability of not losing, which aligns with a different decision-making criterion.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (2500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (5 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

They express doubt about actually receiving the high gain in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to settle with Lottery B, implying that the certainty of a smaller gain is preferred over the uncertainty of a larger gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, disregarding probabilities. In contrast, the individual's deliberation heavily involves the consideration of probabilities and the certainty of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, whereas the individual chooses Lottery B, citing concerns over the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the appeal of a guaranteed outcome in Lottery B.

For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-5 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2500 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.

However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding loss due to high probability, not on comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's requirement to calculate and compare mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the probability of not losing and the comparison of potential losses, rather than on calculating mean outcomes as the decision reason dictates."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B (100% chance) and the risk of losing the same amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the certainty of winning and due to the risk of losing being too high in Lottery A. The individual was tempted by the possibility of winning double the amount in Lottery A but ultimately decided against it due to the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of winning and the risk of losing, rather than the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of winning and risk aversion, not the comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the mean outcome of each lottery or used this information to make their decision. The focus on certainty and risk aversion suggests a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2000) / 1 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning (100% probability) and the difference between the potential gains of Lottery A and Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because it offers a certain win, implying that the certainty of the outcome is a significant factor, and the perceived difference in gains between the two lotteries is not significant enough to opt for the riskier Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on certainty and the difference in potential gains.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery A based on its higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the win and the perceived insufficient difference in potential gains, not explicitly on the mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the certainty of the outcome and the perceived difference in gains, not on the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the decision reason suggests. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000) / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the calculation of their mean.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50% loss possibility of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the 50% loss possibility of Lottery A was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries and their mean) with that considered by the individual (50% loss possibility of Lottery A): The individual did not mention calculating or considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding the high loss possibility of Lottery A): The individual's justification does not match the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on avoiding loss rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery B was based on avoiding the high loss possibility of Lottery A, rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. This does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of taking a risk to potentially gain money with Lottery A versus knowing they would win nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for taking a risk to potentially gain money over the certainty of winning nothing, mentioning a past tendency to play it safe but now wanting to take a risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are both 0 Euros. However, the individual's consideration is more about the risk and potential gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, shows a preference for Lottery A based on a desire to take a risk for potential gain, not explicitly because of the mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision. The focus of the individual's deliberation is on the aspect of risk and potential gain, rather than on calculating and comparing mean outcomes as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
