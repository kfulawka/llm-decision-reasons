STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 ≈ 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 100% chance of receiving 2400 Euros from Lottery B and implies a comparison with the potential outcomes of Lottery A, noting a preference for a guaranteed win over a potential but uncertain higher amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because it offers a 100% guarantee of 2400 Euros, suggesting a risk-averse attitude and a preference for certainty over potential higher but uncertain gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), but the individual chooses Lottery B based on its guaranteed outcome, not the mean outcome. This indicates that the individual's justification does not align with the rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by simply averaging the outcomes. Instead, the individual's choice is based on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, suggesting a different decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the amount (100€ more in Lottery A) and the difference in probabilities (0.1% difference, which they deemed not significant).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the amount was 100€ more and considered the small difference in probabilities to be insignificant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the difference in amounts and the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A, but their justification was based on the difference in amounts and the insignificance of the probability difference, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome, as calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The verbal report does not mention considering the mean outcomes or using such a calculation to make the decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to be the certainty of receiving 3000 Euros from Lottery B, as indicated by ""ich sicher bin 3000€ zu erhalten"" which translates to ""I am sure to receive 3000€"".
Second, the individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of the outcome, not on calculating means or comparing outcomes directly in terms of their averages.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome of Lottery B), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (certainty of receiving 3000 Euros), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than a comparison of mean outcomes, suggesting that the decision reason provided was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of winning the monetary prize between the two lotteries, noting a 5% higher chance of winning 3000 Euros with Lottery A compared to winning 4000 Euros with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it offers a slightly higher chance of winning, even though the amount is less, indicating a preference for a higher probability of a lower reward over a lower probability of a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities of winning. In contrast, the individual focused on the probabilities of winning the monetary prizes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), whereas the individual preferred Lottery A due to its slightly higher probability of winning, not because of the mean outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros), according to this decision reason, Lottery B is preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries (6000 Euros and 0 Euros for B, 3000 Euros and 0 Euros for A) and the number of outcomes for each lottery (2 for both).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of winning (45% for Lottery B) and the potential gain (the amount of money, specifically noting that 45% is less but the amount of money is attractive). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by mentioning the potential for a higher gain (""doppelt so viel zu gewinnen"" - potentially winning twice as much) and the allure of the higher amount (""der Betrag hat mich jetzt gelockt"" - the amount has now lured me).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which depends on the outcomes (3000 Euros and 0 Euros for A, 6000 Euros and 0 Euros for B). The individual, however, talks about the probability and the attractiveness of the higher potential gain, not explicitly mentioning calculating a mean or comparing the average outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B in this case. The individual chooses Lottery B but justifies it with the potential for a higher gain and the allure of the amount, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, while the individual chooses Lottery B, which aligns with the preference of the decision reason, the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the calculation or consideration of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. The individual's focus is more on the potential high gain and its attractiveness rather than on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason's specific rule (comparing mean outcomes) was used in the decision-making process. The individual's justification is based on different aspects (probability and the attractiveness of the potential gain), suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the chances of winning as not very high for both options but focuses on the amount won if they were to win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A by mentioning that if they were to win, they would win at least double the amount compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, does compare the potential winnings, which aligns with part of the decision reason's focus but does not directly calculate or mention the mean.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery A. The individual also chooses Lottery A but justifies it by the potential to win double, not explicitly by calculating the mean outcome of both lotteries.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing the mean outcomes. The individual's focus is on the potential winnings being double, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's preference for the higher mean outcome but does not demonstrate a clear application of the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference in the potential losses (1000 Euros) between the two lotteries and the aspect of still having hope with Lottery A due to its 20% chance of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the difference in potential losses seemed relatively small compared to the hope of avoiding loss altogether in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, whereas the individual considered the difference in potential losses and the aspect of hope.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the hope of avoiding loss and the relative difference in potential losses, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason provided, as there's no mention of calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-2000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of receiving 0 Euros in each lottery, focusing on the 5% difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because they hope to receive 0 Euros with a 5% higher probability compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, calculated by ignoring probabilities. In contrast, the individual focuses on the probabilities of receiving 0 Euros.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery B based on mean outcomes, whereas the individual chooses Lottery A based on the probability of receiving 0 Euros.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, as their justification is based on probability rather than mean outcome calculations.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the potential loss and the risk associated with each lottery. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was to avoid a potentially higher loss associated with Lottery B, indicating a preference for a ""fast sicheren Verlust"" (a nearly certain loss) of -3000 Euros over the risk of a potentially larger loss with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as being considered in the manner described by the decision reason (i.e., calculating the mean outcome). The individual focuses on the risk and the potential loss rather than the mean outcome.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice (avoiding a higher potential loss and preferring a nearly certain loss) does not align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome). The individual's reasoning is more aligned with risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of mean outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros vs -3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of the negative outcomes (-6000 Euros vs -3000 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (0.1% vs 0.2%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the negative outcome is half as much, even though the probability of getting it is slightly higher (0.1% more).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the mean of the outcomes, but the individual focused on the magnitude of the negative outcomes and the difference in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the relative size of the negative outcomes and the slight difference in probabilities, not the mean outcome.
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the mean of all outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions taking the ""sichere Variante"" (safe option) of 500 Euros, indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by preferring the safe option, implying a preference for certainty over potential higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which would lead to indifference between the two lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason’s rule does not explicitly consider the certainty of outcomes or risk aversion, whereas the individual’s justification is based on preferring a certain outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and preference for the safe option does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries based on equal mean outcomes, but the individual's justification is rooted in risk aversion, not mean outcome comparison. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the possibility of not losing money with Lottery A (50% chance of 0 Euros) and the certainty of losing money with Lottery B. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the hope of not losing money, which seems to be driven by the avoidance of certain loss in Lottery B. The deliberation process focuses on the probabilities of losing or not losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of -500 for both lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing or not losing money), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome or being indifferent if the means are equal) to the individual's justification (hope of avoiding loss), the individual's decision seems to be based on a different consideration than the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of receiving any amount of money in both lotteries, specifically comparing the 50% chance in Lottery B to the 25% chance in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a higher chance of receiving any amount of money, even if it means receiving less money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of all outcomes, while the individual focused on the probability of receiving any amount of money. These are different considerations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which is Lottery A), while the individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of receiving any money.

14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 and 0 Euros. Thus, the mean for Lottery A is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived, so we proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential losses and the probabilities, noting that with Lottery A, the losses are split between -4000 and -2000 Euros, and there's a higher chance (75%) of either getting 0 Euros or a lesser loss of -2000 Euros, as opposed to the full -6000 Euros loss possible with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the potential losses are split, offering a form of ""risk reduction"" by not having to face the full -6000 Euros loss as with Lottery B, and there's a higher combined probability of getting either 0 Euros or a smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean outcome of each lottery, independent of probabilities. In contrast, the individual considers both the outcomes and their associated probabilities, particularly how losses are distributed and the higher probability of lesser or no loss with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual prefers Lottery A but for reasons related to the distribution of potential losses and the associated probabilities, not explicitly the mean outcome calculated by simply averaging all outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process aligns with preferring Lottery A, as does the decision reason, but the rationale behind the choice (focusing on probability and loss distribution) does not directly match the decision reason's simplistic mean outcome calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process and factors considered by the individual (probability of outcomes, distribution of losses) do not align with the decision reason's simplistic calculation of mean outcomes independent of probabilities."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean is (5 Euros) / 1 = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (5000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 2500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certainty of winning with Lottery A and compares it with the low probability (0.1%) of winning a higher amount with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because the probability of winning with Lottery B is ""viel zu wenig wahrscheinlich"" (too unlikely), even though it offers the possibility of winning a much higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning and probability of the higher payout): The individual does not mention calculating or considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the certainty and the perceived low probability of the higher payout): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual chooses Lottery A due to its certainty.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B, whereas the individual chooses Lottery A based on the certainty of the outcome and the perceived low probability of winning with Lottery B.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -5 > -2500.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 5000 Euros in Lottery B and compared it to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, focusing on the emotional impact of a significant loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid the potential significant loss associated with the 0.1% probability in Lottery B, preferring the certain but smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which involves a simple arithmetic calculation of all possible outcomes. The individual, however, focused on the potential emotional impact of significant loss and the certainty of outcomes rather than calculating means.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the calculated mean of outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on avoiding a potential significant loss and preferring a certain outcome, which does not directly relate to calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the specific decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes to make the decision. The individual's reasoning was more aligned with risk aversion and avoiding potential significant losses rather than a straightforward calculation of mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of receiving 1500 Euros with Lottery A and the 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they prefer having a certain amount of money (1500 Euros) over the risk of possibly losing 3000 Euros with a 50% probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk of loss): The individual's consideration does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them, but rather focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring certainty over risk): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes risk aversion rather than comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason, which involves calculating and comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries, to make their decision. Instead, the decision seems to be based on a preference for certainty and risk aversion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of a loss in Lottery A and the certainty of a gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they did not want to risk a potential loss, preferring a smaller but certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (possibility of loss and certainty of gain): The individual's considerations do not directly mention the calculation or comparison of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding potential loss and preferring certainty): The individual's justification focuses on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes. The individual's justification is based on avoiding potential loss and preferring a certain gain, which does not reflect the calculation or consideration of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000) / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the potential loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros in Lottery B. The individual is focusing on the avoidance of losses.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is to avoid the potential loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery A, even if it means giving up the chance for a higher gain. The individual is prioritizing the avoidance of losses over the potential for higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential loss and guaranteed gain), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (avoidance of losses), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual is making a decision based on risk aversion and loss avoidance, rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros according to this reason, the decision reason can be applied but would suggest indifference between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high potential loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A and the desire to ""play it safe.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B to avoid the risk of losing 6000 Euros, indicating a focus on risk aversion rather than calculating mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and desire for safety): The individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preference based on mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (risk aversion and desire for safety): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as the decision reason would suggest indifference due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chooses based on avoiding loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason (considering the mean of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities) was not used by the individual to make the decision, as the verbal report shows a focus on risk aversion and avoiding potential loss rather than comparing mean outcomes."
