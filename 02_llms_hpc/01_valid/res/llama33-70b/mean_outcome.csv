To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. 

For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. 
For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros.

We can derive the relevant information (the outcomes) from the lotteries, so the decision reason can be applied.

Next, we calculate the mean outcome for each lottery according to the decision reason's rule:
- For Lottery A: (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros
- For Lottery B: Since there's only one outcome, the mean is 2400 Euros.

Now, we compare the mean outcomes:
- Lottery A has a mean outcome of 1633.33 Euros.
- Lottery B has a mean outcome of 2400 Euros.

Since 2400 Euros (mean of Lottery B) is greater than 1633.33 Euros (mean of Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner: The decision reason requires the outcomes of each lottery to calculate the mean. For both lotteries, the outcomes are given (2500 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, 2400 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B). The number of outcomes for each lottery is also known (2 outcomes for each). Thus, the relevant information can be derived, and we can proceed to calculate the mean for each lottery.

2. Calculate the mean outcome for Lottery A: The outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is calculated as (2500 + 0) / 2 = 2500 / 2 = 1250 Euros.

3. Calculate the mean outcome for Lottery B: The outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is calculated as (2400 + 0) / 2 = 2400 / 2 = 1200 Euros.

4. Apply the decision reason: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. Lottery A has a mean outcome of 1250 Euros, and Lottery B has a mean outcome of 1200 Euros. Since 1250 Euros is greater than 1200 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
