STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2400 / 1 = 2400 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (1633.33 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2400 Euros) is actually not true, the correct calculation shows Lottery A has a higher mean outcome when considering the decision reason's method, this step indicates the decision reason can be applied but the initial interpretation was flawed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is the certainty of the gain in Option A.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is that the gain is secure (""weil dort der Gewinn sicher ist""), which translates to ""because the gain is certain there"". This indicates the individual focused on the risk aspect, specifically the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the certain gain), it is clear the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would not directly consider the certainty of the gain but rather the calculated mean of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are roughly the same (""Fast die selbe Wahrscheinlichkeit"") and considers the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher gain because the probabilities are roughly the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of mean outcomes, which involves considering all outcomes. The individual considered the higher gain, which aligns with comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating means or considering both outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual preferred the lottery with the higher gain given similar probabilities, which indirectly suggests a preference for the higher outcome but does not directly mention calculating means or considering the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the higher gain when probabilities are similar aligns somewhat with the spirit of preferring higher outcomes, as suggested by the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating mean outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification is more about comparing the higher gains directly rather than calculating and comparing mean outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probability of getting a guaranteed amount in one of the options. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was the guarantee of getting a certain amount with 100% probability, which made them choose that option. The described deliberation process focuses on the certainty of the outcome rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guarantee of a certain amount), it appears they did not directly consider the mean outcomes as per the decision reason. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the guarantee of a certain amount), it seems the individual did not follow the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome rather than comparing mean outcomes.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the higher payout of Lottery B and the better probability (quote) of Lottery A. They also compared the probabilities, noting they differ by only 5 percentage points.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because, despite Lottery A having a better probability, the difference in probabilities is small (5 percentage points), making the probabilities ""annähernd gleich"" (approximately equal), and Lottery B has a higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (higher payout of B, better probability of A, and the difference in probabilities). The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries as described by the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing B due to its higher payout and the small difference in probabilities). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process did not directly involve calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the decision reason specifies. Instead, the individual focused on the difference in payouts and the closeness of the probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, specifically mentioning that the probability of a win is greater in Option A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option A because the probability of winning is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning): The individual did not mention considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries but focused on the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning): The decision reason and the individual’s justification are based on different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of both options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with more money, implying they compared the monetary outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which depends on the monetary values of the outcomes. The individual considered the monetary outcomes but mentioned the low probabilities and chose based on the option with more money, not explicitly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual's justification is to choose the option with more money, which aligns with preferring higher outcomes but does not explicitly calculate means or consider the number of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the monetary value and choosing the option with more money somewhat aligns with the principle of preferring higher outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating the mean of the outcomes, which the individual does not mention. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating means or considering the number of outcomes, making it unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined. Thus, the assessment is closer to certain that the decision reason was not used, but there's a slight possibility of alignment due to the preference for the higher monetary value."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros, and since there's only one outcome, the mean is -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. In this case, Lottery A has a higher mean outcome than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possibility of getting 0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery B, highlighting the aspect of not receiving a negative amount. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on a specific aspect of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of both lotteries, which involves all outcomes and their calculation. The individual's report, however, focuses on the positive aspect of possibly not losing money in Lottery B but does not mention calculating means or comparing overall outcomes between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification, as described, does not align with this rule since it highlights a specific probability outcome rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the mean outcomes of both lotteries or applied the decision reason's rule to make their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros > -2000 Euros). The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to be related to the concept of ""Schulden,"" which translates to ""debts"" in English, implying a focus on the negative outcomes of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is ""weil man mit weniger Schulden aus dem Spiel geht,"" which translates to ""because one leaves the game with less debt."" This suggests the individual is considering the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of potential losses or debts), we see there's a connection since both involve considering the outcomes, but the decision reason specifically calculates a mean, which isn't directly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery that results in less debt), while the decision reason and the individual's justification both lead to preferring Lottery B, the rationale provided in the verbal report doesn't explicitly mention calculating means or considering the number of outcomes, which is central to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report indicates the individual considered the magnitude of losses, which aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with less severe negative outcomes), but the specific calculation and rationale provided by the decision reason (calculating mean outcomes) are not explicitly mentioned in the report. Therefore, while there's a superficial alignment in the choice made, the underlying reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -1500 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of ending up with 0 Euros versus incurring a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they believed the chance of ending up with 0 Euros (and thus not incurring a loss) is greater in Lottery B compared to incurring a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of outcomes): The individual focused on the probabilities of the outcomes, specifically the chance of avoiding a loss, rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preference based on avoiding a loss due to higher probability of 0 Euros): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be based on the perceived risk of loss and the desire to avoid it, which is related to the probabilities of the outcomes rather than their mean values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A should be preferred. The relevant information for this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are almost equal, which suggests they considered the probabilities of the two lotteries. They also mention choosing the smaller loss, indicating they considered the potential losses of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the smaller loss, given that the probabilities are nearly equal.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which involves both the outcomes and their calculation. The individual, however, focused on the similarity in probabilities and the magnitude of potential losses, not explicitly on calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A because its mean outcome (-1500 Euros) is higher than Lottery B's (-3000 Euros). The individual's justification is based on preferring the smaller loss when probabilities are almost equal, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it has a smaller loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros), but this is not the same as calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The individual's focus was on the comparison of potential losses given similar probabilities, which, while leading to the same choice (Lottery A), does not demonstrate the use of the specific decision reason provided. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility of alignment due to the choice of Lottery A, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (500)/1 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0)/2 = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A (100% chance of winning 500 Euros) and the uncertainty of the outcome of Lottery B (50% chance of winning 1000 Euros and 50% chance of winning 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the gain was 100% certain, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a key factor in their decision. They acknowledged that Lottery B offered a higher potential win but were deterred by the 50% chance of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is the same for both. However, the individual's deliberation centered on the certainty of the outcome and the potential risks and rewards, not explicitly on the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual preferred Lottery A due to its certainty, not because of a comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by simply averaging the outcomes regardless of their probabilities.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the loss in Lottery B and the possibility of not losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros, so the mean is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit haben einen Gewinn zu machen,"" which translates to ""a higher probability of making a gain."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning in their deliberation.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about having a higher probability of gaining something, which suggests the individual's focus was on the likelihood of receiving any positive outcome rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), we find that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes in their deliberation.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of gaining), we see that these are different criteria for making a decision. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome (-2000 Euros) than Lottery A (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery B should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros in Option A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Option A because of the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros, implying a focus on avoiding loss or the probability of no gain rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of ending up with 0 Euros): The individual does not consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries as described in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the probability of ending up with 0 Euros): The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual chooses Lottery A based on a different criterion.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. To calculate the mean outcome for each lottery according to the decision reason, we need to add up all the outcomes of each lottery and divide by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, there's only one outcome: 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the mean for Lottery A is 5 Euros (since there's only one outcome, it doesn't change), and the mean for Lottery B is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. 

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the certainty of Option A and the low probability of achieving a high gain with Option B. The individual considers the certainty of Option A (""Option A ist sicher"") and the relative improbability of realizing a high gain with Option B (""Option B ist relativ unwahrscheinlich einen so hohen Gewinn zu realisieren""). The justification for the choice seems to hinge on the reliability and probability of the outcomes rather than directly calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated based on all outcomes regardless of probability) with the information considered by the individual (certainty and probability of outcomes). The individual's focus is on the probability and certainty of the outcomes rather than the mean calculated by simply averaging all possible outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this calculation (2500 Euros mean for B vs. 5 Euros mean for A), but this does not align with the individual's justification, which emphasizes the certainty of Option A over the improbability of the high gain in Option B. Thus, the individual's reasoning process does not seem to align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes without considering probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the probability of Lottery A, indicating they are aware of the low probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A. 
Second, the individual justifies their choice of Lottery B without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. The justification is based on the low probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A, but does not explicitly state the decision rule used.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of Lottery A), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (low probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A), it does not match the decision reason's rule, as the individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the risk of losing in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a certain gain and avoids the possibility of losing money as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk of loss), we see they do not directly align. The individual focused on the certainty and risk aspect rather than calculating mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the certain gain and avoiding loss), we observe that the individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply calculating mean outcomes. Instead, the justification is based on the certainty of the outcome and the avoidance of potential loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher mean outcome than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Option A guarantees a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option A because it guarantees a win, implying a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, but the individual's consideration is about the guarantee of a win, not the mean.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome, not the comparison of mean outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of loss in Lottery B.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on the guarantee of a win without the possibility of loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and avoidance of loss), we find that the individual did not explicitly mention or consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preference for the guaranteed win without loss), we see that the individual's reasoning is based on risk aversion and the guarantee of a positive outcome, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision was based on the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of loss, rather than on the calculation and comparison of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros when calculated in this manner.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""No Risk, no Fun"" and a 50-50 chance, indicating they considered the risk aspect and the probability of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be attracted by the potential for gain (""Immerhin 50 zu 50"" translates to ""at least 50 to 50""), suggesting they are considering the gamble aspect of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of 0 Euros for both lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk, fun, 50-50 chance), it appears the individual did not focus on the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (seems to favor the gamble), since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to the decision reason, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's justification does not align with comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason, nor does their justification for choosing a lottery align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome based on the specific calculation method provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
