STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 1%.
This information is relevant to applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the presence of a certain gain in Lottery A and the absence of a potential loss in Lottery B, noting that the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B is a risk they are willing to take for a potentially higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by considering the risk of not winning anything in Lottery B as low enough to be acceptable in exchange for the possibility of a higher gain compared to Lottery A. They also mentioned disregarding the actual probability of winning 2500 Euros over 2400 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the presence of a certain gain in Lottery A and the low risk of not winning in Lottery B, rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% minimum probability. The individual's justification, however, was based on the perceived low risk and potential for a higher gain, not explicitly on comparing minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The individual's focus was on the certainty of gain in one lottery and the low risk of no gain in the other, rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher minimum probability. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 33% (since 33% is less than 67%).
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 34% (since 34% is less than 66%).
The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the possible gains/losses and the percentages. Specifically, they noted the difference in gains (100€) and the difference in percentages (1%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential additional value of 100€ against the 1% difference in probabilities, finding the former more compelling.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probabilities (33% for A and 34% for B), while the individual considered the differences in gains and percentages, not explicitly the minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different consideration (the trade-off between the additional 100€ and the 1% difference in probabilities).
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, as their justification does not mention or imply a preference based on minimum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 100% (or 1), since it offers a guaranteed win of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability of winning is 80%, as it offers 4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 100% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery A versus the 80% probability of winning in Lottery B. They also thought about the potential regret of not winning with Lottery B, despite its higher potential payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win, and they wanted to avoid the potential regret of losing with Lottery B, even though Lottery B offered a higher potential payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the certainty of winning in Lottery A versus the probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with 100% probability. The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the desire for a guaranteed win, which aligns with preferring the higher minimum probability.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual’s decision-making process aligns closely with the decision reason provided, as they both focus on the aspect of certainty versus probability of winning and make a choice based on preferring the option with the higher minimum probability of a positive outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. In this case, both lotteries have a minimum probability associated with the outcome of 0 Euros, which is 80% for Lottery B and 75% for Lottery A. However, the decision reason focuses on the minimum probability, which in the context of the provided lotteries, relates to the probability of not winning (0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of winning, as it implies the minimum probability of not winning is the complementary probability (100% - probability of winning). Thus, the minimum probability considered by the reason would actually be the probability of winning since the reason prefers the higher minimum probability, implying a focus on the chance of getting a positive outcome. For Lottery B, the probability of winning (getting 4000 Euros) is 20%, and for Lottery A, it's 25%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning (20% for Lottery B and 25% for Lottery A), visualizing them as fractions (1/5 for Lottery B and 1/4 for Lottery A) to better understand the difference. They also considered the difference in the potential winnings (1000 Euros) and how it compares to the difference in probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the 5% difference in probabilities (25% - 20%) seemed significant, while the 1000 Euros difference in potential winnings did not seem enough to justify the lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, which translates to the probability of getting a positive outcome. The individual considered the probabilities of winning for both lotteries, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning. The individual chose Lottery A because it had a higher probability of winning (25%) compared to Lottery B (20%), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of the probabilities and their decision based on the higher probability of winning aligns closely with the decision reason provided. The verbal report indicates that the individual's deliberation process and final choice were influenced by the comparison of the probabilities of winning, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (probability of winning 6000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 90% (probability of winning 3000 Euros). Since the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the probabilities of winning in both lotteries, noting that the probability of winning in Lottery B is higher than in Lottery A, especially considering the relative amounts to be won.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a ""sicherere Chance"" (safer chance) due to its higher probability of winning, indicating a concern for the likelihood of the outcome rather than just the outcome itself.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (comparing probabilities and considering the safer chance), it appears the individual did consider the probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing the lottery with the higher probability because it is a safer chance), there is a clear alignment. The individual's reasoning about choosing the safer chance (höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit auf Gewinn) directly corresponds to preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report directly aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning, indicating a high certainty that the decision reason was used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. Given the lotteries A and B, we can derive the relevant information:
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0.1% (or 0.001) for the outcome of 6000 Euros and 99.9% for 0 Euros. The minimum probability here is 0.1%.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 0.2% (or 0.002) for the outcome of 3000 Euros and 99.8% for 0 Euros. The minimum probability here is 0.2%.
The decision reason can be applied since we can identify and compare the minimum probabilities of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual considered the potential gains (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) and the percentages (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual noticed that the potential gain of A was twice as high as B's, but the probability of winning B was twice as high as A's. Based on this, the individual chose B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability, which in this case is the probability of the non-zero outcome for each lottery (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B). The individual considered the probabilities but framed them in the context of comparing the potential gains and the relative probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B (0.2% > 0.1%). The individual chose Lottery B because its probability of winning was twice as high as A's, which aligns with considering the higher minimum probability as the basis for preference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, directly aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The individual's focus on the comparative probabilities of winning and the choice of Lottery B because its winning probability was higher (doubled) than A's, indicates a clear application of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of an outcome (losing 4000 Euros) is 80%, but since there's also a 20% chance of losing 0 Euros, the minimum probability of losing any amount of money is actually 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% because there is a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of losing in each lottery, which can be derived as follows: Lottery A has a minimum probability of losing (in the context of the worst outcome) of 80%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B versus the high probability (80%) of losing 4000 Euros in Lottery A, but also notes the 20% chance of not losing any money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A by preferring the chance (20%) of not losing any money over the certainty of losing a smaller amount (3000 Euros), even though the probability of losing a larger amount (4000 Euros) is high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of outcomes, which in this context would be about the certainty or probability of losing. The individual considers the probabilities and the outcomes but focuses more on the presence of a chance to avoid loss altogether.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a ""higher"" minimum probability (100% chance of losing 3000 Euros), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the chance to avoid any loss, not directly comparing the minimum probabilities of losing as the decision reason would.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would prioritize the lottery with the higher minimum probability of an outcome (in this case, losing), which would be Lottery B with its 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. However, the individual chooses Lottery A based on the possibility of avoiding any loss, which does not directly relate to comparing the minimum probabilities of losing between the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (probability of losing 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% (probability of losing 4000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these minimum probabilities. Since Lottery A has a higher minimum probability (25%) than Lottery B (20%), according to the decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual recognized that both lotteries involve losses and considered the 5% difference in the probability of no loss (or, implicitly, the probability of the loss occurring) between Lotteries A and B as significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the ""potentially higher loss,"" which seems counterintuitive given the usual risk aversion but is based on the individual's perception of the probability difference being ""high enough.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of loss, while the individual considered the difference in the probability of no loss (which indirectly relates to the probability of loss) and the magnitude of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its higher minimum probability of loss, but the individual chose Lottery B, citing the potential for a higher loss as a reason, which does not align with preferring the lottery based on the minimum probability of loss.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the difference in probabilities of no loss and the magnitude of potential losses rather than the minimum probability of loss itself.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of this minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 55% (the probability of getting 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of not losing any money (or getting 0 Euros) in each lottery. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 10% chance of 0 Euros (or not losing)
- Lottery B: 55% chance of 0 Euros (or not losing)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing any money in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher probability of not losing, which aligns with considering the probability of getting 0 Euros in each lottery. However, the verbal report seems to contain a contradiction in the choice made (it mentions choosing Lottery B for its higher probability of not losing, which contradicts the actual probabilities given).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the minimum probability (in this case, the probability of getting 0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (which would be Lottery B with 55% over Lottery A with 10%), but the individual's justification seems misaligned with the actual choice based on the probabilities provided. Given the probabilities, Lottery B indeed has a higher probability of not losing (55% vs. 10%), but the verbal report's reasoning seems flawed because it does not correctly apply to choosing Lottery B based on its stated criteria (higher probability of not losing, which is actually true but the report suggests a misunderstanding in the choice).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0 because, despite the individual's consideration of the probability of not losing (which aligns with the decision reason), the verbal report's justification and the actual probabilities provided suggest a misunderstanding or misapplication of the decision reason in the choice made. The individual's stated reason for choosing Lottery B (higher probability of not losing) actually supports choosing Lottery B, but the confusion and the incorrect application of the reason as stated in the verbal report lead to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used correctly or as intended by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. In this decision problem, the minimum probability for Lottery A is 0.2% (or 0.002) and for Lottery B is 0.1% (or 0.001). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process. The individual considered that both lotteries have the potential to result in a loss or no outcome. They noted that for the double loss (comparing -6000 Euros to -3000 Euros), there was half the probability (comparing 0.1% to 0.2%). The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by stating that 0.1% is ""deutlich geringer"" (significantly less) than 0.2%, which seems to be a misunderstanding since they chose Lottery B despite acknowledging its lower probability of loss, implying they might have been focusing on the relative comparison rather than the absolute probabilities in the context of the decision reason.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the relative comparison of loss probabilities). The individual's justification seems to misunderstand the application of the probabilities in the context of minimizing loss probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A (0.002) over Lottery B (0.001). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing its lower probability as a reason, which aligns with a misunderstanding of the decision reason's rule since the focus should be on the higher probability of no loss (or the lower probability of loss), not the probability of the loss itself.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has a 50% chance of winning 1000 Euros and a 50% chance of winning 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since it guarantees a win of 500 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 1000 Euros, 50% chance of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 500 Euros.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the trade-off between a certain gain (Lottery B) and a potential zero outcome (Lottery A), noting the 50% probability of winning nothing with Lottery A and the double potential amount compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose the certain gain (Lottery B) over the potential higher but uncertain gain (Lottery A) because it offered a secure win, even though the amount was lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. The individual considered the 50% chance of winning nothing with Lottery A and the certainty of winning with Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B (100% probability). The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a secure win, indicating a preference for the certain outcome over the uncertain one, which aligns with preferring the higher minimum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on the minimum probability of winning and the preference for the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The individual's justification for choosing the certain gain over the potential higher but uncertain gain directly reflects the logic of the decision reason, indicating a high certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since the probabilities are 50% for -1000 Euros and 50% for 0 Euros, and 50% is the minimum of these). For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's a 100% chance of losing 500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the chance of not losing anything (which relates to the 50% chance of 0 Euros in Lottery B) versus the certainty of losing money (which relates to the 100% chance of -500 Euros in Lottery A). They seem to focus on the aspect of avoiding a certain loss.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring a 50% chance of not losing anything over a certain loss, indicating a preference for the gamble that offers a chance, however small, of avoiding loss altogether.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the aspect of avoiding certain loss and the chance of not losing, which indirectly relates to the minimum probabilities but doesn't explicitly discuss probabilities in terms of the decision reason's criteria.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification: The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a chance of no loss, which aligns with preferring a higher minimum probability (in this context, 100% for A is technically higher than 50% for B, but the individual's reasoning seems to prioritize the avoidance of certain loss, which is somewhat aligned with but not directly equivalent to the decision reason’s focus on minimum probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning seems to prioritize avoiding certain loss and valuing the chance of no loss, which is somewhat related to but not directly aligned with the decision reason's focus on minimum probabilities. The decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would technically be Lottery A (100% minimum probability of losing 500 Euros), contrary to the individual's choice. Thus, while there's a superficial alignment in valuing the avoidance of loss, the underlying logic of the decision reason (comparing minimum probabilities directly) does not seem to be the basis for the individual's decision. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certain that the decision reason was not used."
13,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome) since the other outcome is 0 Euros with a higher probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is also 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes) since the 0 Euros outcome has a higher probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the minimum probabilities of winning any amount in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in both lotteries, visualizing them with balls, noting that Lottery B has 1/4 chance of winning and Lottery A has 2/4 chances of winning some amount. They also considered the potential gains from each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided that the risk of not winning (75% for Lottery B and 50% for Lottery A) in relation to the potential winnings (6000 Euros for B vs. 4000 or 2000 Euros for A) made Lottery B more appealing, essentially choosing the higher potential reward despite the higher risk of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, but the individual's consideration was more about the balance between the risk of not winning and the potential reward, not directly comparing the minimum probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning, but the individual's justification was based on the potential reward versus the risk of not winning, not directly on the minimum probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the higher minimum probability of winning. The individual's focus was on the trade-off between the potential winnings and the risk of not winning, rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of winning in each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum outcome with the same probability or the higher probability of the minimum outcome if the minimum outcomes are the same. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with 25% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with 25% probability. Since both lotteries have the same probability for their minimum outcomes but different minimum outcome values, the decision reason can be applied by comparing these minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual initially looked at the percentages because it was the first problem with 3 possible outcomes. They then realized both lotteries only had losses, which led them to focus less on the numbers (probabilities) and more on choosing the lottery where they could avoid losses with a higher probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they believed it offered a higher probability of not making a loss, which seems to be a misunderstanding since Lottery B has a 75% chance of 0 Euros (no loss), while Lottery A has a 50% chance of 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the minimum outcomes of the lotteries or their probabilities if the minimum outcomes are the same. The individual, however, focused on avoiding losses, which indirectly relates to the outcomes but not directly to comparing minimum outcomes or their probabilities as the decision reason suggests.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum outcome or, if outcomes are the same, the higher probability of that outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding losses with a higher probability, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule since the individual chose based on the probability of no loss (0 Euros) rather than the minimum outcome's probability or value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the minimum outcome and its probability, while the individual's choice was based on avoiding any loss with a higher probability, indicating a different decision-making criterion was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 100% (or 1) since there is only one outcome with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) for winning 5000 Euros, but since there's also a 99.9% chance of winning 0 Euros, the minimum probability relevant to the decision reason is actually 0.001, which is the lowest probability of any outcome in Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100% for winning 5 Euros.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 0.1% for winning 5000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of winning 5 Euros in Lottery A and the extremely low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the impact of winning or not winning in both lotteries on their personal financial situation.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the practical impact of the winnings rather than directly comparing probabilities. They mention that winning 5 Euros makes little difference, but winning 5000 Euros would be a significant success. However, they also note that not winning 5000 Euros is not considered a loss, indicating a perspective that may not directly align with comparing minimum probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probabilities (certainty vs. low probability) but did not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries as the basis for their decision.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its 100% minimum probability. The individual's justification, however, revolves around the personal significance of the winnings rather than a direct comparison of the minimum probabilities of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability as the basis for their choice. Their focus was more on the practical implications of the winnings and the subjective value of the outcomes rather than a strict comparison of minimum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (for the -5000 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (for the -5 Euros outcome). Since the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0.1%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the magnitude of the potential losses (-5000 Euros vs. -5 Euros) and the probability of the significant loss in Lottery A (""die Chance auf den Verlust von 5000 super gering ist""), indicating they are aware of the low probability of the large loss. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the certain loss of 5 Euros is ""quasi nichts"" compared to the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even though the chance of losing 5000 Euros is very low. They also mention the potential regret of choosing Lottery A if the low-probability loss occurs.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual: While the individual discusses the probability of the significant loss, they do not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries as the basis for their decision.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the magnitude of potential losses and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B, rather than explicitly stating a preference based on the minimum probabilities of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision is influenced more by the certainty and magnitude of the losses rather than a direct comparison of the minimum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the decision reason does align with the outcome of choosing Lottery B, as it has the higher minimum probability (100% for the -5 Euros outcome), which indirectly supports the decision reason. But since the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the minimum probabilities as the decision criterion, it suggests the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as stated.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, despite the chosen outcome coincidentally matching what the decision reason would prefer."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (as there are two outcomes, each with 50% probability). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win) versus ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of one lottery versus the risk of loss in the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on preferring the safe win over the potential for loss, implying a focus on avoiding risk or ensuring a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on minimum probabilities, while the individual talks about the safety of the win and potential for loss, which can be indirectly related to the concept of minimum probabilities (since a 100% probability of a win is the safest option).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which aligns with choosing the safe, guaranteed win (Lottery A) over the lottery with a 50% chance of loss (Lottery B). The individual's justification, while not explicitly mentioning probabilities, aligns with the principle of preferring the option with no risk of loss, which corresponds to the higher minimum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention probabilities but focuses on the concept of a safe win versus potential loss, which aligns with the principle of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. While there's a clear alignment in the preference (choosing the safe option), the report does not explicitly discuss probabilities, making it slightly uncertain whether the decision reason was the basis for the choice. However, given the nature of the decision and the justification provided, it's more likely than not that the decision reason played a role in the decision-making process."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since the lowest probability among its outcomes is 50%). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the minimum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win) and compares it to a ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of one lottery and the risk of loss in the other. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides in favor of the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win), implying they preferred the option that guarantees a positive outcome over the one that includes a risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probabilities (100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B), while the individual focuses on the presence of a guaranteed win versus a potential loss, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes but is framed in terms of outcome certainty rather than probability values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A (100%). The individual prefers the ""sicheren Gewinn,"" which is also Lottery A, indicating a preference for the option with the guaranteed positive outcome, aligning with the decision reason’s rule but based on the certainty of the outcome rather than explicitly mentioning probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its guaranteed positive outcome), the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing minimum probabilities as the basis for the decision. Instead, it focuses on the certainty of the win, which indirectly relates to the probability but does not directly state a comparison of minimum probabilities as the decision criterion. Therefore, it is likely but not certain that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (or 1) because it offers a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (or 0.5) since it has a 50% chance of either winning 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher minimum probability than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 1000 Euros in Lottery A versus the 50-50 chance of either winning 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B. They weighed the certainty of a gain against the potential for a significant loss, despite the potential gain being three times higher.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certainty of a gain (1000 Euros from Lottery A) over the risk of a potential loss (from Lottery B), even though the potential gain from Lottery B is higher. The justification is based on a preference for security and avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty (100% probability) of winning in Lottery A versus the uncertainty (50% probability) of outcomes in Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which is Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring the certainty of a gain over the risk of a potential loss, which indirectly reflects a preference for the higher minimum probability (certainty) of Lottery A.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as both prioritize the certainty (or higher minimum probability) of a positive outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since both outcomes have a 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: Minimum probability = 50%
- Lottery B: Minimum probability = 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual first looks at the lottery with a certain outcome (100% probability), which is Lottery B, noting that nothing changes with this choice. Then, they consider Lottery A, recognizing it has a 50-50 chance of either winning or losing the same amount.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because they would rather have no change than take a 50% risk of losing 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual does consider the certainty of Lottery B (which aligns with looking at the minimum probability) but does not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring no change over a risk), we observe that the individual's justification indirectly aligns with preferring the higher minimum probability (100% for Lottery B) because they value the certainty of no change, which is a result of the 100% probability of Lottery B.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to align with the decision reason in the sense that they prioritize the certainty (100% probability) of Lottery B over the uncertainty (50% probability) of Lottery A. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries. Instead, it focuses on the preference for certainty over risk, which is consistent with but not a direct expression of the decision reason.
