STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, specifically those with a probability of less than 20%, and adjusts their weights by increasing them by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 1%, which is less than 20%, so its weight would be increased to 11%. The outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is greater than 20%, so its weight remains unchanged at 33%. The outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is also greater than 20%, so its weight remains unchanged at 66%. For Lottery A, since the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 100%, which is greater than 20%, its weight remains unchanged at 100%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

The adjusted probabilities for Lottery B according to the decision reason are:
- 2500 Euros: 33%
- 2400 Euros: 66%
- 0 Euros: 11% (increased from 1%)

However, to apply the decision reason correctly, we must calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery B, the calculation considering the adjustment would be:
(2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.11) = 825 + 1584 = 2409

For Lottery A, the calculation remains straightforward:
(2400 * 1.00) = 2400

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B, which indicates they were aware of the low-probability outcome in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they took into account the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B, implying that this low-probability outcome influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason specifically focuses on outcomes with probabilities less than 20%, and the individual mentioned considering the 1% chance of winning nothing, which aligns with the type of information the decision reason considers.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their adjusted probabilities. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding the risk of the 1% chance of winning nothing, which indirectly suggests considering the impact of low-probability outcomes on their decision, similar to the decision reason's focus.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's consideration of the low-probability outcome in Lottery B and their decision to avoid this risk by choosing Lottery A aligns with the principles of the decision reason, which also considers the impact of such low-probability outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, increasing the weight of outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a 33% probability, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 67% probability. For Lottery A, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a 34% probability, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 66% probability. Since neither of the probabilities is less than 20%, the weights for the outcomes in both lotteries will not be increased according to the decision reason. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, but since the probabilities are above the 20% threshold, no adjustment is made. The relevant information for the decision reason in this context is essentially the original probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in probabilities (1% more chance of winning) and the difference in the amounts to be won (100 Euros less in Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because they valued the 1% higher chance of winning over the 100 Euros more offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on adjusting probabilities below 20%, which is not applicable here, and then comparing the weighted outcomes. The individual, however, focused on the slight difference in winning probabilities and the difference in the winning amounts, not explicitly on weighting probabilities or outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, with specific adjustments for low-probability outcomes. The individual's justification, however, is based on a straightforward comparison of probability differences and monetary differences without any mention of weighting probabilities or applying a specific rule like the one described in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason involves a specific rule for adjusting probabilities and comparing weighted outcomes, which is not reflected in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. The individual's focus on the difference in winning probabilities and the amount to be won, without any indication of applying the specific weighting rule for low-probability outcomes, suggests that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, increasing the weight of outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the 0 Euros outcome has a 20% probability, which is exactly the threshold, so it does not receive an increased weight. For Lottery A, there are no outcomes with a probability less than 20% since it has a 100% chance of 3000 Euros. Thus, the weighted outcomes for Lottery B are: (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros, and for Lottery A, it remains 3000 Euros, as there's no adjustment needed. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it comes without the risk of earning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on adjusting probabilities of low-probability outcomes, but the individual's verbal report does not mention any adjustment or consideration of probability weights; instead, it focuses on the absence of risk in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the more favorable sum of weighted outcomes does not align with the individual's justification, which is based on avoiding the risk of earning nothing, not on a weighted sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, increasing the weight of outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which does not meet the criteria for the increased weight since it is exactly 20% and not less. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which also does not meet the criteria. However, since neither outcome has a probability less than 20%, we consider the objective probabilities as given for both lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason in this context is the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery, but given the specifics of this problem, it simplifies to comparing the expected values or directly comparing the outcomes and their probabilities as the individual's report suggests.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. This is indicated by ""Wie jedes Mal verglich ich erstmal die Ergebnisse und dann die Wahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""As every time, I first compared the outcomes and then the probabilities.""
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that the 5% difference in probabilities was considered too small. This implies the individual was comparing the probabilities of the two lotteries and made a decision based on the perceived significance of the difference in these probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (weighted outcomes based on probabilities, with a specific rule for outcomes with less than 20% probability) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it appears the individual did consider the basic elements (outcomes and probabilities) but did not explicitly mention adjusting probabilities based on the decision reason's specific rule.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, with an adjustment for low-probability outcomes) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the perceived insignificance of the 5% probability difference), there's a disconnect. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention weighting outcomes by probabilities or applying any specific adjustment for low-probability outcomes as described by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery and adjusts their weights by increasing the probability of outcomes with less than 20% probability by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the 6000 Euros outcome has a 45% probability, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 55% probability. For Lottery A, the 3000 Euros outcome has a 90% probability, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 10% probability. The decision reason can be applied since we can derive the necessary information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The adjusted probabilities for outcomes with less than 20% probability would be: for Lottery A, the 0 Euros outcome's probability increases to 20% (10% + 10%), and for Lottery B, neither outcome's probability is adjusted because both are above 20%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for the choice, only the process of comparing outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on adjusting probabilities of outcomes with less than 20% probability, but the verbal report does not mention any adjustment or specific focus on low-probability outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the verbal report does not provide a clear justification for the choice beyond comparing outcomes and probabilities, it's difficult to directly compare it to the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the specific decision reason described, as there is no mention of adjusting probabilities for low-probability outcomes or a clear indication that this rule was applied in the decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
6,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery and adjusts their weights by increasing them by 10 percentage points if the probability is less than 20%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 20%, so its weighted probability would be 0.1% + 10% = 10.1%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, also less than 20%, so its weighted probability would be 0.2% + 10% = 10.2%. The relevant information for the decision reason includes these adjusted probabilities and the respective outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. Second, the individual justified the choice of Lottery A by stating that since the chances of winning are very low in both lotteries, they preferred the lottery with the larger, albeit unlikely, win. This indicates the individual focused on the potential gains and their improbability, rather than a detailed probabilistic calculation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (adjusted probabilities and outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities), it appears the individual did consider the basic elements (outcomes and probabilities) but there's no explicit mention of adjusting probabilities. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their adjusted probabilities) to the individual's justification (preferring the larger win due to its potential, despite low probability), there's a conceptual alignment in prioritizing larger outcomes when probabilities are low, but the individual's process seems more intuitive rather than strictly following the decision reason's specific rule of adjusting probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process shares some intuitive alignment with the decision reason, particularly in prioritizing larger potential gains when probabilities are low, there is no clear indication that the specific rule of adjusting probabilities by 10 percentage points for outcomes with less than 20% probability was used. The individual's justification is more about the preference for a larger potential win given low probabilities rather than a calculated decision based on adjusted probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the small probability outcomes of each lottery, adjusting their weights if the probability is less than 20%. For Lottery B, there's an outcome of -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Since neither outcome has a probability less than 20%, no adjustment is made according to the reason's rule. For Lottery A, there's a -3000 Euros outcome with 100% probability, which also doesn't require an adjustment. However, it's crucial to note that the reason's application involves comparing the weighted outcomes of both lotteries. Since no outcome in either lottery has a probability less than 20%, the original probabilities are used for the comparison. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason in this context is the original probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance to remain ""verlustfrei"" (loss-free), which translates to avoiding a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the desire to choose the option that allows for a chance to remain loss-free, implying the individual focused on the potential to avoid any financial loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves a complex calculation considering the probabilities and outcomes, especially focusing on outcomes with less than 20% probability. However, the individual's consideration was on avoiding loss, which simplifies to preferring the lottery with a chance of no loss (0 Euros in Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about comparing weighted outcomes based on their probabilities, with a specific adjustment for low-probability outcomes. The individual's justification, however, is based on a straightforward preference for avoiding any loss, without mentioning or implying the use of weighted probabilities or the specific adjustment rule.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the detailed probabilistic calculation and adjustment process of the decision reason. The focus on avoiding loss and the chance to remain ""verlustfrei"" does not indicate the application of the specific rule about weighting outcomes based on their probabilities, especially the adjustment for low-probability outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery and adjusts their weights. For Lottery A, the outcome of -4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is exactly the threshold for the adjustment. However, since it's exactly on the threshold, it does not receive an increased weight. For Lottery B, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is above the threshold for adjustment. Thus, neither outcome in either lottery receives an increased weight according to the decision reason's rule. The relevant information for the decision reason in this case is simply the original probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries because neither meets the criteria for an increased weight.

- Lottery A: -4000 Euros with 20% probability, 0 Euros with 80% probability
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability

The weighted sum for Lottery A is: (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros
The weighted sum for Lottery B is: (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probability of losing money in each lottery. The report mentions a preference for having ""nur eine Chance von 1/5"" (only a 1/5 chance) of losing money, which translates to a 20% chance, indicating the individual focused on the probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A.

Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the preference for the lower probability of losing money, which implies a focus on the risk aspect rather than the potential loss amount or the weighted sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the original probabilities and outcomes since neither outcome's probability qualifies for the weight increase) with that considered by the individual (the probability of losing money), it appears the individual did focus on a key aspect relevant to the decision reason but not necessarily in the manner prescribed by the reason (considering the weighted sums).

Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities) to the individual's justification (preferring the lower probability of losing money without explicit mention of comparing weighted sums), there seems to be a discrepancy. The individual's decision is based on the probability of loss rather than the calculated weighted sums of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason as defined. The decision reason involves calculating weighted sums and comparing them, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was more on the probability of losing, which aligns with part of the decision reason's considerations but does not encompass the full rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used as defined, given the discrepancies between the individual's decision process and the rule specified by the decision reason. However, it is not a 0 because the individual did consider probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, albeit not in the manner or to the extent the reason prescribes."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, increasing the weight of outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a 90% probability, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability. Since 10% is less than 20%, the weight for the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery A would be increased to 20%. For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a 45% probability, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability. Neither of these probabilities is less than 20%, so their weights remain unchanged. The relevant information for the decision reason includes these adjusted probabilities and the original outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery and adjusts their weights. Given the lotteries A and B, we can derive the relevant information:
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Since 0.1% is less than 20%, the weight for -6000 Euros increases by 10 percentage points, making it 10.1%.
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. Since 0.2% is less than 20%, the weight for -3000 Euros increases by 10 percentage points, making it 10.2%.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes these adjusted probabilities.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities, adjusting the weights of outcomes with probabilities less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability. Since none of the outcomes have a probability less than 20%, no adjustments are made. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes weighted by their probabilities for each lottery. For Lottery A, this is (1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, it is (500 * 1) = 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred to realize a secure gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the weighted outcomes based on their probabilities, considering adjustments for low-probability outcomes. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not mention adjusting probabilities or focusing on the specific calculation of weighted outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of weighted outcomes, which in this case would result in a tie between the two lotteries since both have an effective value of 500 Euros under the decision reason’s criteria. The individual’s justification is based on preferring a secure gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s specific calculation or adjustment for low-probability outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the weighted sum of outcomes, where outcomes with a probability of less than 20% receive a weight increased by 10 percentage points than their objective probability. For Lottery A, the outcome -1000 Euros has a 50% probability, which is not less than 20%, so its weight remains 50%. The outcome 0 Euros also has a 50% probability, so its weight remains 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome -500 Euros has a 100% probability, which is not less than 20%, so its weight remains 100%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

The weighted sum for Lottery A is: (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500.
The weighted sum for Lottery B is: (-500 * 1) = -500.
Since neither outcome has a probability less than 20%, the weights are not adjusted.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not making a loss, which implies they focused on the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to choose the chance of not making a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the weighted sum of all outcomes, while the individual focused on the chance of not making a loss, which is only one aspect of the decision problem. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, but the individual's justification is based on avoiding a loss, not directly comparing the weighted sums of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as their focus was on avoiding a loss rather than comparing the weighted outcomes of the two lotteries. However, the individual's choice does align with a simplistic interpretation of risk avoidance, which might tangentially relate to the decision reason's focus on outcomes. Yet, the specific mechanism of weighting probabilities and summing outcomes as described in the decision reason does not appear to have been directly applied.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities, adjusting the weights of outcomes with probabilities less than 20% by increasing them by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcomes and their probabilities are 6000 Euros with 25% and 0 Euros with 75%. For Lottery B, the outcomes and their probabilities are 4000 Euros with 25%, 2000 Euros with 25%, and 0 Euros with 50%. Since none of the probabilities are less than 20%, no adjustments are made according to the decision reason. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason in this specific case is the original probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions choosing Lottery B because it was associated with less risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is based on the perceived risk of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on adjusting probabilities and outcomes, whereas the individual considered risk, which is a more general concept that could encompass various factors, including but not limited to the specific probability adjustments outlined in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason involves a specific mathematical adjustment and comparison based on weighted outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on a qualitative assessment of risk without mentioning any specific probability or outcome adjustments.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific rule outlined in the decision reason, which focuses on adjusting probabilities for outcomes with less than 20% probability and comparing the weighted sums. The individual's rationale of ""less risk"" does not explicitly mention or imply the use of the specific probability adjustment rule described in the decision reason.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, adjusting outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a 25% probability, which does not meet the criteria for adjustment since it's above 20%. For Lottery A, none of the outcomes have probabilities less than 20% either, so no adjustments are made according to the decision reason's criteria. However, to follow the reason's rule properly, we must calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery as per the given probabilities without adjustments since neither outcome meets the <20% threshold for adjustment:
- Lottery B: (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500
- Lottery A: (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1000 - 500 = -1500
Both lotteries, under the standard probability weighting (without the decision reason's adjustment), yield the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first compares the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. They chose Lottery B. The report is brief and does not explicitly mention considering the small probability outcomes or applying any specific rule like the one described in the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the weighted sum of outcomes considering the adjustment for probabilities less than 20%) with what the individual considered (outcomes and probabilities in general), it appears the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific rule about adjusting probabilities. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is not detailed, but it does not seem to align with the specific decision reason provided, as there's no mention of adjusting probabilities or focusing on outcomes with less than 20% probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the fact that the verbal report does not indicate the use of the specific decision reason regarding the adjustment of probabilities for outcomes with less than 20% probability, and the individual's choice does not reflect a consideration of the rule as described in the decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery, increasing the weight of outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcome of 5000 Euros has a 0.1% probability, which is less than 20%, so its weight would be increased to 10.1%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 5 Euros has a 100% probability, so its weight remains at 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered achieving a gain versus not achieving one.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred to achieve a gain rather than not.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, especially focusing on the adjustment of probabilities below 20%. The individual's report does not explicitly mention probabilities or the specific outcomes of both lotteries, only a general preference for achieving a gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason involves a specific mathematical adjustment to probabilities and a comparison of weighted outcomes. The individual's justification is based on a preference for achieving any gain over not achieving one, without mention of probabilities or the specific rule applied by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the specific probabilities or applied the rule of adjusting probabilities below 20% as described in the decision reason. Their justification is based on a general preference for achieving a gain, which does not align with the detailed probabilistic consideration required by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery and adjusts their weights. For Lottery A, the outcome of -5000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 20%. According to the decision reason, this outcome's weight should be increased by 10 percentage points, resulting in a weighted probability of 10.1%. The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is not adjusted. For Lottery B, the outcome of -5 Euros has a probability of 100%, which is also not adjusted. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the adjusted probabilities and the outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. They mention considering the results (""Ergebnisse"") and the probability (""Wahrscheinlichkeit""), indicating they looked at both aspects of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they prefer a minimal loss over the small chance of a large loss. This implies they were weighing the potential losses against the probabilities of those losses occurring.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the outcomes and their probabilities, especially focusing on adjusting the weights of low-probability outcomes. The individual considered both outcomes and probabilities but does not explicitly mention adjusting the weights of low-probability outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their adjusted probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on avoiding a large loss, which aligns with considering the impact of low-probability events but does not explicitly mention recalculating probabilities or comparing weighted sums.

Given these comparisons, the individual's process seems to intuitively consider the elements that the decision reason is based on (outcomes and their probabilities, with a particular concern for low-probability high-impact events), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention the specific rule of adjusting probabilities by 10 percentage points for outcomes with less than 20% probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on a preference for minimal loss over a small chance of a large loss, which could be consistent with the decision reason's intent but does not clearly demonstrate the application of the specific rule regarding probability adjustments.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered elements relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities, with a focus on avoiding large losses), the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (adjusting probabilities and comparing weighted sums) is not clearly described in the verbal report. Thus, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but the individual's decision process seems to align more with general risk aversion principles rather than the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities and outcomes of each lottery, adjusting the weights of outcomes with probabilities less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Neither of these probabilities is less than 20%, so no adjustment is made. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not require adjustment. The relevant information for the decision reason is the weighted sum of the outcomes for each lottery. However, since neither outcome in either lottery has a probability less than 20%, the weighted sums are calculated directly from the given probabilities and outcomes without adjustment. Thus, for Lottery A, the weighted sum is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the weighted sum is 1500 * 1 = 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Ich wählte Lotterie A, da es mir am sinnvolllsten erschien,"" which translates to ""I chose Lottery A because it seemed most sensible to me."" The information considered by the individual is not explicitly stated in terms of probabilities or outcomes, but the justification for the choice is based on what seemed ""sinnvoll"" (sensible), which does not directly reference the specific rule of adjusting probabilities or comparing weighted sums as described in the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the weighted sums of outcomes based on adjusted probabilities) with that considered by the individual (not explicitly stated but justified by what seemed sensible), there appears to be a mismatch. The decision reason's rule involves a specific calculation and comparison of weighted outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, especially since the report does not mention any calculation or comparison of outcomes based on probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the specific decision reason that involves adjusting probabilities and comparing weighted sums of outcomes. The justification provided is too vague and does not reference the specific criteria outlined in the decision reason, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on adjusting the weights of outcomes based on their probabilities, specifically increasing the weight of outcomes with probabilities less than 20% by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Neither of these probabilities is less than 20%, so no adjustment is made. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not require an adjustment. The relevant information for the decision reason in this case is simply the original probabilities and outcomes since none of the outcomes have probabilities less than 20%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied by directly comparing the expected values or the simple sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities without any adjustments.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions choosing Lottery A to ensure a gain, indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the certainty of achieving a gain with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves considering the weighted outcomes based on their probabilities, but the individual focused on the certainty of gain, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention weighting or adjusting probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, but the individual's justification is about ensuring a gain, not explicitly about comparing weighted outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's focus on certainty and ensuring a gain does not directly align with the specific rule of adjusting probabilities for low-probability events and then comparing the sum of weighted outcomes. The individual's reasoning appears more straightforward, focusing on the guaranteed positive outcome of Lottery A without mentioning any weighting or adjustment of probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of outcomes and adjusts the weights of outcomes with probabilities less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Neither of these probabilities is less than 20%, so no adjustment is made. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not require an adjustment since it's not less than 20%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery. However, given the probabilities and outcomes, the adjustment rule does not apply directly as neither outcome in either lottery has a probability less than 20%. Thus, the decision reason would consider the lotteries based on their actual probabilities without adjustment.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the second option (implied to be the less favorable outcome) of Lottery A to the first option of another, unspecified scenario where there was 2000 Euros. This comparison is not directly relevant to the decision between Lottery A and Lottery B as described. The individual seems to focus on the relative value of outcomes rather than the specific probabilities and the application of a weighting rule based on those probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about receiving a ""zu schlechte zweite Option"" (too bad second option) in comparison to another scenario, not directly addressing the probabilities or the specific outcomes of Lottery A and Lottery B in a manner that suggests a systematic consideration of weighted outcomes based on probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires consideration of probabilities and potentially adjusted weights for outcomes with low probabilities. The individual's verbal report does not indicate a focus on these aspects, especially concerning the specific probabilities and the rule for adjusting weights.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason involves a specific rule for evaluating lotteries based on adjusted probabilities for low-probability outcomes. The individual's justification does not reflect this rule or any consideration of probabilities in a systematic way related to the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, the verbal report does not suggest that the individual applied the specific decision reason that considers the small probability outcomes with adjusted weights. The report lacks mention of probabilities, adjusted weights, or a comparison that aligns with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of outcomes and applies a weighting rule to outcomes with probabilities less than 20%, increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability. Neither of these outcomes has a probability less than 20%, so no weighting is applied according to the decision reason. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not meet the criteria for weighting. However, since the decision reason is about comparing the sum of weighted outcomes and both lotteries' relevant probabilities are above 20%, we directly compare the expected values without applying the weighting rule. The expected value of Lottery B is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 0 Euros * 1 = 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason, as it stands, would consider both lotteries equal since neither has an outcome with a probability less than 20%, and their expected values are the same.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery A because they considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros at 50% too great. This implies the individual focused on the potential loss associated with Lottery B and its probability. The justification for choosing Lottery A is essentially avoiding the risk of a significant loss present in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities, with a focus on those below 20% probability) to what the individual considered (the risk of losing 6000 Euros at 50% probability), it's clear the individual did not specifically address outcomes with probabilities less than 20%, as neither lottery has such outcomes. The decision reason's rule about weighting probabilities less than 20% does not directly apply here, as explained in Step 1. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding a significant risk) does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule (comparing weighted sums of outcomes based on their probabilities, with adjustments for low-probability outcomes). However, the individual's focus on risk avoidance could be seen as related to the concept of evaluating outcomes based on their probabilities, albeit without the specific weighting adjustment for low-probability events.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because the decision reason specifically pertains to adjusting the weights of outcomes with probabilities less than 20%, which is not directly relevant to the choice between these two lotteries, as neither has outcomes with such low probabilities. The individual's reasoning, as reported, focuses on risk aversion rather than the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. However, it's not a 0 because the individual does consider the probability of an outcome (the 50% chance of losing), showing some alignment with considering probabilities in decision-making, even if not in the manner specified by the decision reason."
