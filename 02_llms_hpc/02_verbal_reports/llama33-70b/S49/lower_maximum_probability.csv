STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (for 2400 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for 2400 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 66% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual started by examining Lottery B, then looked at the fields of Lottery A, focusing on the sums and probabilities, especially to assess if the 1% risk of getting nothing was worth the potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided that the risk of losing (1% chance of getting nothing) was not worth the potential gain of 100 Euros more in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the risk (1% chance of getting nothing) and the potential gain in Lottery A compared to the certainty of Lottery B, not explicitly on the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (66% maximum probability). However, the individual's justification for choosing between the lotteries was based on the risk and potential gain, not the comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower maximum probability. The focus was on the risk and potential gain rather than the comparison of maximum probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 66% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of 67% for Lottery A and 66% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity between the two lotteries, the difference in winnings (Gewinndifferenz), and the difference in probabilities (Prozentzahl).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers 100 Euros more with only a 1% lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision. Instead, the individual discusses the difference in winnings and the small difference in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on the trade-off between the difference in winnings and the small difference in probabilities, not on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, was used to make the decision. The focus of the individual's deliberation was on the difference in potential winnings and the slight difference in probabilities, rather than on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (for winning 4000 Euros), but since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, we note that Lottery B also has a 20% probability of winning 0 Euros, which does not affect the maximum probability value relevant to the decision reason. However, the key point here is comparing the maximum probabilities: 100% for A and 80% for B. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B based on its rule because 80% is lower than 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning with Lottery A and the higher potential reward but also the higher risk of winning nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because of its 100% winning probability, suggesting that the certainty of the outcome was more important than the potential for a higher reward with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for A and 80% for B. The individual considered the winning probabilities but seemed to focus on the certainty of the outcome for A rather than comparing the maximum probabilities directly as the decision reason would.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A because of its 100% winning probability, which suggests they preferred the certainty of winning over the potential for a higher reward, even though this certainty (100%) is actually the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process and justification do not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. The individual prioritized the certainty of winning offered by Lottery A, which has the higher maximum probability, contrary to what the decision reason would suggest. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery B has a maximum probability of 80% (for winning 0 Euros), and Lottery A has a maximum probability of 75% (for winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower maximum probability (75% vs 80%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the winning amount and the probability of winning between the two lotteries. They noted that Lottery A has a lower winning amount but a higher probability of winning compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the higher probability of winning with Lottery A outweighs the lower winning amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of not winning (0 Euros) in both cases. The individual, however, focused on the probability of winning and the winning amount, not directly on the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual chose Lottery A but based their justification on the higher probability of winning, not the lower maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on the probability of winning and the amount to be won, rather than the maximum probability of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (the probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (the probability of winning 3000 Euros). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both lotteries and compared them. 
The individual looked at the probabilities of both lotteries to get a complete picture. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by stating that the probability of winning something in Lottery B is 45% higher, which implies that this higher probability is a significant factor in the decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the primary consideration. 
The individual considered the probability of winning, but the report does not explicitly state that the maximum probability (in this case, the probability of not winning in Lottery A and winning in Lottery B) was the key factor. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (55% for not winning) over Lottery B (90% for winning). 
However, the individual's justification emphasizes the higher probability of winning in Lottery B as a positive aspect, which contradicts the decision reason’s preference for the lower maximum probability. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus and the preference expressed in the verbal report do not align with the decision reason’s criteria.

Wichtig war bei mir hierbei, dass ich bei dem jeweiligen anderen Feld bei 0 € bin und keinen Verlust mache.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros) and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the following information: the difference in the potential winnings between the two lotteries (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros), the similarity in probabilities (0.1% difference), and the fact that in both lotteries, there is a possibility of ending up with 0 Euros, which they interpreted as not making a loss. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its higher potential winnings and the minimal difference in probabilities, along with the consideration of not incurring a loss in either option.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (difference in winnings, similarity in probabilities, and the aspect of not making a loss), it is clear that the individual did not focus on the maximum probabilities as the decision reason does. Instead, the individual's decision was influenced by the potential winnings and the concept of not incurring a loss. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (preferring the higher potential winnings and considering the minimal probability difference). Therefore, the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for losing -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% for losing -4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially focused on the sums of Lotteries A and B, then considered the percentages of the outcomes, noting that Lottery A results in a 100% loss, while Lottery B has an 80% chance of loss, implying a 20% chance of not losing (or ""winning"" in the context of avoiding loss).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a small possibility of ""winning"" (not losing), whereas Lottery A results in a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the percentages (probabilities) of the outcomes but framed their decision in terms of the possibility of avoiding loss rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with an 80% maximum probability of loss. The individual chose Lottery B, but their justification was based on the presence of a chance to avoid loss (a 20% chance of not losing), rather than explicitly stating a preference for the lower maximum probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability). The individual's focus was on the existence of a chance to avoid loss in Lottery B rather than comparing the maximum probabilities directly.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), their justification and the process described in the verbal report do not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined (comparing maximum probabilities to make the decision). The individual's reasoning was more focused on the presence of a chance to avoid loss rather than the comparative probabilities of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 75% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities: 80% for Lottery A vs. 75% for Lottery B. Since the probabilities can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential loss between the two lotteries (higher loss in Lottery A than in Lottery B) and the difference in probabilities (only a 5% difference).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a smaller loss but a higher probability of loss compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (difference in losses and probabilities): The individual considered the probabilities but focused on the difference in probabilities related to losses rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose Lottery B due to smaller loss despite higher loss probability): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its lower maximum probability (75% vs. 80%), but the individual's reason was based on the magnitude of loss and the comparative probabilities of those losses, not the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. While the individual considered probabilities, the focus was on different aspects (difference in loss probabilities and magnitude of loss) rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice, but there is a slight indication that probabilities were considered, hence a score slightly above 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower maximum probability (55%) compared to Lottery B (90%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses and their associated probabilities for both lotteries, comparing the sums and their probabilities to make a decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A, suggesting they are making a decision based on the probability of avoiding loss rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and losses but did not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, but the individual's justification seems to focus on the probability of avoiding loss (getting 0 Euros) rather than directly applying the rule of preferring the lower maximum probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the probability of avoiding loss rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the individual not using the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20"
10,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In the context of the given lotteries, the maximum probability for both lotteries is the probability of winning 0 Euros, which is 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B), the probabilities of these losses (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B), and the probabilities of winning 0 Euros (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B over Lottery A because, despite the similar probabilities of not losing (99.9% vs. 99.8%), the potential loss in Lottery B (3000 Euros) is less severe than in Lottery A (6000 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case is the probability of winning 0 Euros. The individual did consider these probabilities but focused more on the comparison of potential losses and the associated probabilities rather than the maximum probabilities alone.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.8% vs. 99.9%). However, the individual's justification is based on the comparison of potential losses and the fact that the probabilities of not losing are similar, not directly on the comparison of the maximum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. The individual's focus was more on the potential losses and the fact that the probabilities of these losses are similar, rather than on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the outcome of the individual's decision (choosing Lottery B) coincidentally aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability of winning 0 Euros, which is Lottery B due to its 99.8% probability compared to Lottery A's 99.9% probability).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The assessment is low because, while the individual's choice coincides with the decision reason's preference, the verbal report indicates that the individual's justification and decision-making process were based on different considerations (comparison of potential losses and their probabilities) rather than the maximum probability rule specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 50% (for both outcomes), and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 500 Euros in Lottery B (100% chance) and the risk of winning nothing in Lottery A (50% chance). They also mentioned the potential higher gain in Lottery A but stated it was not of great importance to them.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a secure and good win, emphasizing the risk of getting nothing in Lottery A. They downplayed the significance of the higher potential win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the certainty (100% probability) of winning in Lottery B and the uncertainty (50% chance of nothing) in Lottery A, which aligns with the concept of maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% maximum probability) over Lottery B (100% maximum probability). However, the individual chose Lottery B because it was seen as a secure option, despite its higher maximum probability, which contradicts the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its certainty and security, which directly opposes the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the lower maximum probability. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability of 50%
- Lottery B: Maximum probability of 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probability of loss in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 100% loss in Lottery B and the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A. They also considered their personal financial situation, noting they have 2000 Euros available and that any loss would not come from their existing wealth but would instead reduce potential gains.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by preferring the 50/50 risk of losing in Lottery A over the 100% loss in Lottery B, indicating a preference for the option with a lower guaranteed loss probability. They also factored in their personal financial situation, which influenced their risk tolerance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities of loss in both lotteries, aligning with the decision reason's focus on probability, although they also considered additional personal financial factors.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability. The individual preferred Lottery A because it had a lower guaranteed loss probability (50%) compared to Lottery B (100%), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process considered the probabilities of the outcomes, similar to the decision reason, and their justification for choosing Lottery A aligns with preferring the lower maximum probability of loss. However, the individual also considered additional factors not directly related to the decision reason, such as their personal financial situation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's focus on probabilities and the individual's justification for their choice. However, it is not a perfect match due to the individual considering additional factors beyond just the probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 75%
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 50%
Since the decision reason can be applied, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all aspects, specifically comparing the overall probabilities of winning with each lottery, noting that Lottery B offers a 50% chance of winning, while Lottery A offers a 25% chance of winning any amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the higher probability of winning with Lottery B compared to Lottery A, despite the difference in potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which would lead to comparing the 75% probability of 0 Euros in Lottery A with the 50% probability of 0 Euros in Lottery B. However, the individual compared the overall probabilities of winning (25% for A and 50% for B), not specifically the maximum probabilities as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50% for 0 Euros). The individual preferred Lottery B but based on the higher overall probability of winning, not the lower maximum probability as per the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process and the decision reason overlap in the outcome (both prefer Lottery B) but differ in the criteria used for the preference (maximum probability of any outcome vs. overall probability of winning). The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual considered the ""maximum probability"" as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not align with the specific criteria (maximum probability) that the decision reason is based on. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the basis for the individual's decision, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment in the choice outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 75% chance of 0 Euros, and 25% chance of -6000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 0 Euros, 25% chance of -4000 Euros, and 25% chance of -2000 Euros.
Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, the key information is the 75% probability for Lottery A and the 50% probability for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of losing money in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 25% chance of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A and the combined losses but higher probability of losing money in Lottery B. They also considered the probabilities of not losing money (0 Euros) in both lotteries, comparing the 75% chance in Lottery A to the 50% chance in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice of Lottery A over Lottery B by mentioning that despite the higher potential loss in Lottery A, the probability of losing money (considering the context, it seems there was a focus on the probability of not losing, which is higher in A) was a decisive factor. They preferred the higher chance of not losing any money (75% in Lottery A) over the lower chance in Lottery B (50%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities of outcomes, particularly focusing on the chance of not losing money, which indirectly relates to the maximum probabilities (since the maximum probability in both lotteries is associated with not losing money). However, the individual's consideration seems to be more about the avoidance of loss and the comparative probabilities of not losing, rather than directly applying the rule of choosing based on the lower maximum probability.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, seems to prioritize the higher probability of avoiding a loss (which aligns with preferring Lottery A due to its 75% chance of 0 Euros, but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly state a preference for the lower maximum probability as the decision rule).

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's decision aligns with preferring the lottery that could be interpreted through the lens of the decision reason (since Lottery A's maximum probability is for not losing, and it's higher, but the decision reason actually would prefer the lower maximum probability which is a misunderstanding in the application), the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for the choice. The individual's focus was more on the comparative probabilities of losing and not losing, rather than explicitly applying the rule of choosing the lottery with the lower maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there's a superficial alignment in the choice made, the underlying reasoning provided in the verbal report does not clearly align with the decision reason's rule, suggesting that the individual did not directly use this reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 5 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 99.9%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the number of ""Auswahlfelder"" (choice fields or options) in Lottery B, the 100% chance of winning in Lottery B, and the comparison of the potential winnings from both lotteries (noting that the sum from Lottery A is 1000 times higher than the win from Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified considering Lottery A due to its higher potential payout compared to Lottery B, despite the very low probability of winning, and the fact that there's no financial investment required to participate in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's considerations were more focused on the potential payouts and the certainty of winning in Lottery B, rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 99.9% maximum probability for winning nothing. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the two lotteries in this manner; instead, it focuses on the potential rewards and the lack of financial risk in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. The individual's considerations were more about the potential payouts and the certainty of winning, rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for losing 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for winning 0 Euros, but since the reason focuses on the maximum probability, we consider the probabilities given: 0.1% for losing 5000 Euros and 99.9% for 0 Euros. The maximum probability in this context, as per the reason's criteria, would be considered as the highest probability value associated with any outcome, which is 99.9% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A. Thus, the relevant information is that Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100% and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 99.9%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the amount of loss in each lottery and the risk associated with losing a significant amount in Lottery B.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the risk aversion to losing 5000 Euros, despite the low probability, and the perception that a 5 Euro loss is not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (amounts of loss and risk), it seems the individual focused more on the potential losses and their probabilities rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability) with the individual's justification (focusing on risk aversion and perceived loss), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the potential for significant loss and its perceived impact rather than a comparison of the maximum probabilities of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the observation that the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the criteria specified by the decision reason. The individual's focus on the risk of significant loss and the perceived magnitude of potential losses does not reflect a consideration of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the primary decision criterion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning and losing), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 50%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual considered the 100% chance of winning with Lottery B.
- The individual noted the 50% chance of winning and the 50% chance of losing with Lottery A.
- The individual compared the winning amounts of Lotteries B and A.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of winning and avoids losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery.
- The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries but focused more on the certainty of winning with Lottery B and the risk of loss with Lottery A.

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability.
- The individual preferred Lottery B because it is the safer option with no risk of loss, not explicitly because it has a higher maximum probability, but rather despite having a higher maximum probability.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome and the avoidance of loss rather than on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason suggests. The decision reason would actually lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its lower maximum probability (50% vs 100%), which contradicts the individual's choice.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 2000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning 3000 Euros and losing 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first considered the winning amounts and then the probabilities, spending more time comparing the probabilities. The individual notes that Lottery A offers a 100% chance of winning, while Lottery B only offers a 50% chance of winning. The justification for choosing Lottery A is that the potential gain from Lottery B is not enough to justify the risk of getting nothing, implying a focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), it is clear that the individual did consider the probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case because its maximum probability (50%) is lower than Lottery A's (100%). The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the certainty (100% probability) of winning in Lottery A as the reason for choosing it, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lower maximum probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 1000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning 3000 Euros and losing 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.
We can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the solid sum of Lottery A and the potential losses of Lottery B, focusing on the 100% win chance of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because it offers a 100% win chance, as opposed to Lottery B, which includes the possibility of losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considered the 100% win chance of Lottery A and the potential losses of Lottery B, implying consideration of the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A but not directly comparing the maximum probabilities as stated in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50%). However, the individual's justification is based on preferring the certainty of a win (100% chance) over a lottery that includes potential losses, not directly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the certainty of a win in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, not by directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the gain and loss outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 0 Euros outcome). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the neutrality of receiving 0 Euros and expresses a preference for not incurring losses (as possible in Lottery A) over the certainty of getting nothing (in Lottery B). The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on avoiding losses and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual is more focused on the outcomes (avoiding losses and the neutrality of 0 Euros) rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% maximum probability) over Lottery B (100% maximum probability). However, the individual's justification for the choice, as described, emphasizes the preference for avoiding potential losses and the certainty of not losing in Lottery B, rather than explicitly discussing probabilities. This suggests the individual's reasoning might not directly align with the decision reason's rule about maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing maximum probabilities or using such a rule to make the decision. The individual's focus on avoiding losses and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria."
