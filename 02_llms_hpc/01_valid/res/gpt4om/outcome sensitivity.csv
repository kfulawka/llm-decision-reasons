outcome sensitivity
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem: 
   - Lottery A has outcomes of 2500 Euros (33% probability), 2400 Euros (66% probability), and 0 Euros (1% probability).
   - Lottery B has a single outcome of 2400 Euros (100% probability).
   - The decision reason specifies a preference based on the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

2. Summarize the relevant information for each lottery in terms of maximum and minimum outcomes:
   - Maximum outcome of Lottery A is 2500 Euros, minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
   - Maximum outcome of Lottery B is 2400 Euros, minimum outcome is 2400 Euros.

3. Apply the decision reason:
   - The maximum outcome for Lottery A (2500 Euros) is more favorable than the maximum outcome for Lottery B (2400 Euros).
   - Since the maximum outcomes are different and Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the lotteries:
   - Lottery A offers a maximum outcome of 2500 Euros (with a probability of 33%) and a minimum outcome of 0 Euros (with a probability of 67%).
   - Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of 2400 Euros (with a probability of 34%) and a minimum outcome of 0 Euros (with a probability of 66%).
   
2. Compare the maximum outcomes:
   - The maximum outcome of Lottery A (2500 Euros) is greater than the maximum outcome of Lottery B (2400 Euros).

3. Since the maximum outcomes are not identical and Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome, the decision reason clearly prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the relevant information from the two lotteries. 
- Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with a probability of 80% and 0 Euros with a probability of 20%. The maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%. The maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros.
 
Since the information about the outcomes can be derived, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Comparing the maximum outcomes: Lottery A (4000 Euros) vs Lottery B (3000 Euros). Lottery A has the more favorable maximum outcome.
- Since the maximum outcomes are not identical, we do not need to compare the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Identify the outcomes and probabilities for each lottery.
   - Lottery A: 4000 Euros (20% probability) and 0 Euros (80% probability).
   - Lottery B: 3000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability).

2. Evaluate the maximum outcomes for both lotteries:
   - Maximum outcome of Lottery A is 4000 Euros.
   - Maximum outcome of Lottery B is 3000 Euros.
   - Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome (4000 Euros vs 3000 Euros).

3. Since the maximum outcomes are not identical and Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome, apply the decision reason strictly: It prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which is Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries' outcomes:
- Lottery A has outcomes of 6000 Euros (45% probability) and 0 Euros (55% probability).
- Lottery B has outcomes of 3000 Euros (90% probability) and 0 Euros (10% probability).
The maximum outcomes here are 6000 Euros for lottery A and 3000 Euros for lottery B. The minimum outcomes are 0 Euros for both lotteries. 

Step 2: Apply the decision reason:
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Since 6000 Euros (lottery A) is greater than 3000 Euros (lottery B), the decision reason prefers lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: The relevant information derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities is as follows:
- Lottery A offers a maximum outcome of 6000 Euros and a minimum outcome of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of 3000 Euros and a minimum outcome of 0 Euros.

Since we can derive relevant outcomes from the lotteries, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Applying the decision reason rule:
- The decision reason states that preference is given to the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Comparing the maximum outcomes: 6000 Euros (A) vs. 3000 Euros (B), Lottery A (6000 Euros) is clearly more favorable than Lottery B (3000 Euros). 

Thus, Lottery A is preferred as it has the higher maximum outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: First, we assess the relevant information about the lotteries. 
- Lottery A offers -4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The maximum outcome here is 0 Euros, and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros.
- Lottery B offers -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The maximum outcome is -3000 Euros, and the minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros.

Since we can extract the maximum and minimum outcomes from both lotteries, we will proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Now we apply the decision reason which prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. 
- The maximum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) is compared with the maximum outcome of Lottery B (-3000 Euros). Since 0 Euros is more favorable than -3000 Euros, Lottery A is preferred based on the maximum outcomes. 

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes of each lottery, especially on the maximum and minimum outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. The maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. The maximum outcome is also 0 Euros, and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. Since the relevant information regarding the differences in maximum and minimum outcomes can be derived, I will proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Both lotteries have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros; hence we will compare the minimum outcomes, which are -4000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. Since -3000 Euros (the minimum outcome of Lottery B) is less unfavorable than -4000 Euros (the minimum outcome of Lottery A), according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has the more favorable minimum outcome. 

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Evaluate the outcomes and probabilities of lotteries A and B. 
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros with a probability of 45% and a maximum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 55%. 
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -3000 Euros with a probability of 90% and a maximum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 10%.

Next, I compare the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries:
- The maximum outcomes are both 0 Euros.
- The minimum outcome for A is -6000 Euros and for B is -3000 Euros. 

Since the maximum outcomes are identical, I proceed to the comparison of minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome, I compare the minimum outcomes:
- The minimum outcome of lottery A is -6000 Euros, which is worse (more unfavorable) than the minimum outcome of lottery B, which is -3000 Euros.

Given that the minimum outcome of B is more favorable than that of A, I conclude that the decision reason prefers lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the outcomes and probabilities for each lottery:
   - Lottery A: 
     - Outcome -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability (minimum outcome)
     - Outcome 0 Euros with 99.9% probability (maximum outcome)
   - Lottery B: 
     - Outcome -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability (minimum outcome)
     - Outcome 0 Euros with 99.8% probability (maximum outcome)

2. The maximum outcomes for both lotteries are identical (0 Euros). Therefore, we compare the minimum outcomes.
   - Minimum outcome of Lottery A is -6000 Euros.
   - Minimum outcome of Lottery B is -3000 Euros.

3. Since -3000 Euros is more favorable than -6000 Euros, and the decision reason specifically states that it prefers the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome when the maximum outcomes are identical, we conclude that the reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the relevant information from the lotteries.
- Lottery A offers 1000 Euros with a probability of 50% and 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. The maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 500 Euros.
The maximum outcome of Lottery A (1000 Euros) is favorable compared to Lottery B (500 Euros). Hence, the relevant information has been derived, and we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to decide.
- According to the decision reason, the reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.
- Comparing the maximum outcomes: 1000 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 500 Euros (Lottery B).
Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A over Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess the lotteries: 
   - Lottery A has two outcomes: -1000 Euros (50% probability) and 0 Euros (50% probability). The maximum outcome is 0 Euros, and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros.
   - Lottery B has one outcome: -500 Euros (100% probability). The maximum outcome is -500 Euros, and the minimum outcome is also -500 Euros.
   
2. Compare the maximum outcomes: 
   - Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a maximum outcome of -500 Euros.
   Since 0 Euros (from Lottery A) is greater than -500 Euros (from Lottery B), the decision reason prefers the maximum outcome of Lottery A over Lottery B.

3. Since the maximum outcomes are different, there is no need to check the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. **Assess the lotteries**:
   - Lottery A: 
     - Maximum outcome: 6000 Euros 
     - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros 
   - Lottery B:
     - Maximum outcome: 4000 Euros 
     - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros 

   The maximum outcome for Lottery A (6000 Euros) is greater than the maximum outcome for Lottery B (4000 Euros).

2. **Apply the decision reason**: 
   - According to the decision reason, we first consider the maximum outcomes. Since 6000 Euros (Lottery A) is more favorable than 4000 Euros (Lottery B), this leads to a preference for Lottery A over Lottery B. The minimum outcomes are not needed for further comparison in this case since the maximum outcomes already determine the preference.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assessing the lotteries:
   - Lottery A has outcomes of -6000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability).
   - The minimum outcome for Lottery A is -6000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B has outcomes of -4000 Euros (25% probability), -2000 Euros (25% probability), and 0 Euros (50% probability).
   - The minimum outcome for Lottery B is -4000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros.
   
   Since we can derive relevant information about the outcomes and their probabilities, we proceed to Step 2.

2. Applying the decision reason:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Both Lottery A and Lottery B have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros.
   - Since the maximum outcomes are identical, we now compare the minimum outcomes. The minimum outcome for Lottery A is -6000 Euros, while the minimum outcome for Lottery B is -4000 Euros.
   - -4000 Euros (Lottery B's minimum) is more favorable than -6000 Euros (Lottery A's minimum).

Because of the more favorable minimum outcome, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the outcomes of each lottery.
- Lottery A: It has a maximum outcome of 5000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%.
- Lottery B: It has a maximum outcome of 5 Euros with a probability of 100%, and a minimum outcome of 5 Euros as well.

The decision reason specifies that it prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Because the maximum outcome of Lottery A (5000 Euros) is greater than that of Lottery B (5 Euros), we can apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
Since Lottery A offers a substantially higher maximum outcome than Lottery B, the decision reason prefers Lottery A over Lottery B as it considers the maximum outcome as important. 

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the relevant information from the lotteries. Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros (with a 99.9% probability) and a minimum outcome of -5000 Euros (with a 0.1% probability). Lottery B has a maximum outcome of -5 Euros (100% probability) and a minimum outcome of -5 Euros (also 100% probability). In terms of maximum outcomes, Lottery A (0 Euros) is better than Lottery B (-5 Euros). Therefore, we can apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. The decision reason states that we prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, while Lottery B has a maximum outcome of -5 Euros. Since 0 Euros is more favorable than -5 Euros, we prefer Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. **Assess the Lotteries**: Lottery A offers two outcomes: 3000 Euros with a 50% probability and -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery A is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. Lottery B offers a guaranteed outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability, so its maximum and minimum outcomes are both 1500 Euros.

2. **Summarize Relevant Information**: 
   - Lottery A: Maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, minimum outcome is -3000 Euros.
   - Lottery B: Maximum outcome is 1500 Euros, minimum outcome is 1500 Euros.

3. **Apply Decision Reason**: The decision reason states that we should prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Comparing the two maximum outcomes: 3000 Euros (A) versus 1500 Euros (B), we see that 3000 Euros is more favorable than 1500 Euros. Hence, Lottery A is preferred over Lottery B based on the maximum outcome.
