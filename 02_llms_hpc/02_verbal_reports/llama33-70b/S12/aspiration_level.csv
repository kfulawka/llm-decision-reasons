STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500, 2400, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery A, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Option A because ""der Gewinn sicher ist,"" which translates to ""the gain is secure."" This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A as a key factor. The individual’s justification focuses on the security of the gain, not explicitly on the differences from an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the gain), there's a mismatch. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and evaluating the probability of outcomes being above this level, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the security of the gain, not on comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, the decision reason’s rule does not align with the individual’s justification for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275 Euros) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros), while Lottery B has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175 Euros) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are roughly the same (""Fast die selbe Wahrscheinlichkeit""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn""), indicating they compared the potential gains from the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the rough equality of probabilities and the comparison of gains, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual chose based on the higher gain without mentioning probabilities of positive or negative differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The verbal report does not mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level, which are key components of the decision reason.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery B, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given Lottery A's outcomes and their probabilities (80% chance of a positive difference and 20% chance of a negative difference) and Lottery B's certain positive difference, we can derive the necessary information for the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% probability of getting a certain amount (implied to be Lottery B, as it's the only option with a 100% guarantee) as important.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option because it guaranteed a certain amount with 100% probability, implying a preference for certainty over potential higher rewards.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the guarantee of a certain amount, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, centers around the guarantee of a certain amount, which does not directly relate to the concept of aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome rather than the specific calculations and comparisons involved in the decision reason.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 3500 / 4 = 1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 1750 = 2250, 0 - 1750 = -1750
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 1750 = 1250, 0 - 1750 = -1750
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the higher payout of Lottery B and the better probability (quote) of Lottery A. They noted that the probabilities of the two lotteries differ by only 5 percentage points, making them approximately equal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because, despite Lottery A having a slightly better probability, the difference in probabilities is small (5 percentage points), which they considered negligible compared to the higher payout of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the difference in payouts and the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries, without mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual, however, based their choice on the absolute difference in payouts and the relative similarity in probabilities, not on the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The focus on payout differences and probability similarities without reference to an aspiration level or positive differences indicates that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0)/4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 90% (since the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level with 90% probability), and for Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level with 45% probability).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of a win (""Wahrscheinlichkeit auf einen Gewinn"") being greater for Option A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option A because the probability of winning is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes being above this level. The individual considered the probability of winning, which aligns with part of the decision reason's focus but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level. The individual preferred Option A because it has a higher probability of winning, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since a win (3000 Euros) in Option A is a positive difference from the aspiration level, and this occurs with a higher probability than a positive difference in Option B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
The individual's justification for choosing Option A because it has a higher probability of winning aligns with the spirit of the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with a higher probability of outcomes being above the aspiration level. However, the individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of outcomes to it, which are key components of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not a perfect match, leading to a score above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes, ignoring their probabilities, and then comparing the differences between outcomes and this aspiration level. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability.
The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 Euros.
The differences between outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 6000 - 4500 = 1500 (positive), 0 - 4500 = -4500 (negative).
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 4500 = -1500 (negative), 0 - 4500 = -4500 (negative).
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since only Lottery B offers a positive difference, and it does so with a 0.1% probability, while Lottery A does not offer any positive difference, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B based on its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities of both options are low (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeiten sind bei beiden Optionen gering"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with more money (""daher habe ich die Option mit mehr Geld gewählt""), implying they focused on the potential gain without directly mentioning probabilities or the aspiration level concept.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the low probabilities and the amount of money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it's the only one offering a positive outcome. However, the individual's justification is based on choosing the option with more money, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as described by the decision reason. The justification provided (choosing the option with more money due to low probabilities) does not directly reflect the decision reason's criteria, suggesting that while the outcome might be the same, the reasoning process described does not align closely with the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 + (-3000)) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33; for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) and Lottery A has no chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is always -3000 Euros, which is below the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possibility of receiving 0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery B, implying they considered the outcomes of Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual highlights the chance of not receiving a negative amount in Lottery B, which suggests they focused on avoiding losses or the presence of a non-negative outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the possibility of a non-negative outcome in Lottery B but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences across both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual’s focus on the possibility of not receiving a negative amount (0 Euros) in Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the possibility of a non-negative outcome in Lottery B partially aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the lack of explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level, comparing probabilities of positive differences, or applying the specific rule of the decision reason suggests that the individual did not directly use this reason to make the decision. The assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used (0) than to certainty it was used (100), but there is a slight indication that the individual's thought process might have tangentially related to aspects of the decision reason, hence a score slightly above 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Outcomes for Lottery A: -4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Outcomes for Lottery B: -3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as: (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: -4000 - (-1750) = -2250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
- For Lottery B: -3000 - (-1750) = -1250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 
For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 80% (since the 0 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level).
For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since the 0 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level).
Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher probability (80%) of a positive difference compared to Lottery B (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""Schulden"" (debts), implying they looked at the negative outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they perceived it as resulting in ""weniger Schulden"" (less debt), indicating a focus on minimizing losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of ""Schulden"" (debts) and choosing the option with ""weniger Schulden"" (less debt) does not directly align with the aspiration level calculation but does indicate a concern with the magnitude of negative outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it with the notion of less debt, not directly mentioning probabilities of positive or negative outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the calculated aspiration level. The focus on ""weniger Schulden"" (less debt) suggests a different rationale for the choice, not directly related to the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -4500 / 4 = -1125 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, it's -6000 - (-1125) = -4875; for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125; for -3000 Euros, it's -3000 - (-1125) = -1875; and for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since positive differences are associated with outcomes of 0 Euros in both lotteries, we need to compare the probabilities of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries. Lottery B offers 0 Euros with 55% probability, and Lottery A offers 0 Euros with 10% probability. Thus, Lottery B has a higher probability of a positive difference (in this context, not losing) compared to the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of ending up with 0 Euros instead of a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of ending up with 0 Euros (instead of a loss) is greater.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the chance of avoiding a loss, which aligns with preferring outcomes that are positive differences from an implied aspiration level (in this case, avoiding loss).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences (in this context, not losing), which aligns with the individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B because it offers a greater chance of not losing (ending up with 0 Euros).

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason's focus on avoiding losses (which can be interpreted as seeking positive differences from an aspiration level of not losing), even though the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences in the way the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high degree of certainty that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification and the decision reason's preference for avoiding losses (or achieving positive outcomes relative to an aspiration level). However, it's not a perfect match since the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention an aspiration level or compare probabilities of positive differences as the decision reason prescribes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is the same as above, 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive differences are associated with the 0 Euro outcomes, we look at the probabilities of these outcomes in each lottery. Lottery A has a 99.8% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, and Lottery B has a 99.9% probability of a 0 Euro outcome. Therefore, based on the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a slightly higher probability of the outcome (0 Euros) that results in a positive difference from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are almost the same (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeiten sind fast gleich""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. They also mention deciding based on the smaller loss (""den kleineren Verlust""), which suggests they compared the potential losses of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is to choose the option with the smaller loss because the probabilities are nearly equal. This implies they are comparing the potential losses (-6000 Euros for Lottery B and -3000 Euros for Lottery A) and choosing the lesser of the two evils given similar probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the similarity in probabilities and the magnitude of losses, not explicitly on the aspiration level or positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would be Lottery B due to its slightly higher probability of a 0 Euro outcome. In contrast, the individual prefers Lottery A because it has the smaller loss, not explicitly because of the probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the smaller loss given similar probabilities, rather than on the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences from it. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (500 + 1000 + 0) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 500 - 500 = 0; for Lottery B, 1000 - 500 = 500 and 0 - 500 = -500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% probability of a zero difference (not positive) and Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference (500 Euros) and a 50% probability of a negative difference (-500 Euros), we can apply the decision reason to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A (100% chance of 500 Euros) and the uncertainty of the gain in Lottery B (50% chance of 1000 Euros and 50% chance of 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a 100% certain gain, as opposed to Lottery B, which had a 50% chance of a higher gain but also a 50% chance of no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as described, focus on the certainty of the gain in one option versus the uncertainty in the other, without explicit mention of an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from this level.

For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since a positive difference occurs in Lottery A with 50% probability (when the outcome is 0 Euros) and does not occur in Lottery B (since the difference is 0), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing nothing (0 Euros) in Lottery A (50% chance) and the certainty of loss in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the aspect of certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the chance of not losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (probability of losing nothing in Lottery A and certainty of loss in Lottery B), we see that the individual's considerations align with aspects of the decision reason, particularly in focusing on the chance of a non-negative outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the chance of not losing in Lottery A versus the certainty of loss in Lottery B), it appears the individual's reasoning is consistent with the decision reason, as the individual seems to prefer the option that offers a chance of a better outcome (not losing), which aligns with preferring a higher probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the individual's considerations and the decision reason's criteria. However, it is not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences, hence not a 100% certainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we first need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery A, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason considers the probability of positive differences. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference or zero difference (since a difference of 0 can be considered as not negative) is 50% (25% for the 4000 Euros outcome and 25% for the 2000 Euros outcome).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery A, stating that there is a higher probability of making a gain (Gewinn). The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the probability of winning. The justification for the choice is based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning in the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (probability of making a gain), there is a partial match since both involve considering probabilities related to winning, but the decision reason specifically calculates an aspiration level and compares outcomes to it, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification (higher probability of making a gain), there is a similarity in that both involve preferring a lottery based on a form of probability comparison, but the verbal report does not specify the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40

This assessment reflects that while there are elements in the verbal report that align with the general concept of considering probabilities of winning, the specific details of the decision reason (such as calculating an aspiration level and focusing on the probability of positive differences from this level) are not clearly reflected in the individual's justification. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but the similarity in focusing on probabilities of winning suggests it is not entirely unrelated."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -4000, and -2000 Euros, which is (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000) / 4 = -3000 / 4 = -750 Euros. However, the reason specifically considers the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Thus, we need to calculate these differences for each outcome:
- For Lottery A: -6000 - (-750) = -5250 Euros and 0 - (-750) = 750 Euros.
- For Lottery B: -4000 - (-750) = -3250 Euros, -2000 - (-750) = -1250 Euros, and 0 - (-750) = 750 Euros.
The decision reason can be applied by comparing the probabilities of outcomes that result in positive differences from the aspiration level in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the higher probability of going out with 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because of the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, but the individual's consideration is about the probability of ending up with 0 Euros, not directly about positive differences from an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual prefers Lottery A due to a higher probability of a specific outcome (0 Euros), which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the higher probability of getting 0 Euros, which does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 ≈ -1666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 ≈ 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a fixed outcome and Lottery B has a very low probability of achieving the high outcome, we can proceed to evaluate how this applies to the individual's decision-making process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of Option A (""Option A ist sicher"") and the low probability of achieving a high gain with Option B (""Option B ist relativ unwahrscheinlich einen so hohen Gewinn zu realisieren""). This indicates the individual is focusing on the certainty of the outcome in Option A and the uncertainty of the high outcome in Option B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the reliability of the outcome, with Option A being reliable and Option B being unreliable for achieving a significant gain. The focus is on the probability of achieving a high gain rather than calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing the probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of one option and the uncertainty of the other, without explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the certain option over the uncertain one, which aligns with avoiding negative differences (in this case, the significant risk of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B) but does not explicitly mention preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences from it. The individual's focus is more on the certainty of the outcome rather than on the specific calculation and comparison involved in the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of Lottery A but does not explicitly discuss the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and an aspiration level.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose Lottery B despite acknowledging the low probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A, but the justification provided does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual's report does not mention such calculations or considerations explicitly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual’s justification does not explicitly mention this rule or any similar reasoning based on aspiration levels and positive differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on the probability of Lottery A and the decision to choose Lottery B does not explicitly reflect a consideration of aspiration levels or the preference for lotteries based on the probability of outcomes exceeding such a level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (2500) and a 50% probability of a negative difference (-3500). Lottery B has a 100% probability of a positive difference (1000). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the risk of losing money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a certain gain and avoids the risk of losing money as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the certainty of gain and the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or its calculation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a certain gain, which aligns with preferring a positive outcome but does not directly reference the probability of positive differences as calculated by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice and justification share some intuitive alignment with the decision reason (preferring a certain gain over a risky option), the explicit calculation and consideration of an aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason are not clearly reflected in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there is some alignment in the preference for a certain gain, the specific process and considerations of the decision reason are not clearly evident in the individual's verbal report, indicating that it is unlikely the decision reason was used as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 Euros and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67 Euros; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference, the reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""Option A has a guaranteed win,"" which indicates they considered the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Option A because it guarantees a win, implying the importance of having a secure, positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the guaranteed win of Lottery A without explicit mention of comparing outcomes to an aspiration level or considering probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed positive outcome (as in Lottery A) over a lottery with a 50% chance of a negative outcome (as in Lottery B). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (Lottery A over Lottery B because it guarantees a positive outcome), the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice is consistent with the outcome the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason, with its specific focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences, was used in making the decision. The individual's justification is more straightforward, focusing on the guaranteed win of Lottery A without explicit reference to the components of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33; for Lottery B, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (2666.67) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-3333.33), and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (666.67), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Option B and the possibility of making no loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option B because the gain is certain and there's no risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of gain and the avoidance of loss, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 100% chance of a positive difference. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B but is based on the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of loss, not the specific rule of maximizing the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (choosing Lottery B) but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule regarding aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The focus on certainty and loss avoidance suggests a different underlying rationale. Thus, while the choice matches, the process described does not clearly reflect the use of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, let's follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 - 6000 + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 0 Euros for Lottery A. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B based on its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""No Risk, no Fun"" and then decides to choose an option, specifically mentioning ""Immerhin 50 zu 50"" which translates to ""at least 50 to 50,"" referring to the 50% probability of each outcome in Lottery B. This suggests the individual is considering the risk aspect and the probability of outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be based on the acceptance of risk (""No Risk, no Fun"") and the equal probability of outcomes in Lottery B (""50 zu 50"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual seems to focus on the risk aspect and the equal probability of winning or losing in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 50% chance of a positive outcome. The individual chooses Lottery B but justifies it based on the risk and the 50-50 chance, not explicitly on the basis of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, while the individual chooses Lottery B, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the justification provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the rule of the decision reason. The individual's focus is on risk and probability rather than on the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described by the individual does not clearly indicate the use of the aspiration level concept or the comparison of outcomes to this level as the basis for the decision. The individual's justification is more aligned with a general acceptance of risk and the probabilities of the outcomes rather than the specific rule of the decision reason being evaluated."
