STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The reason considers the probability of positive differences, so we need to calculate these probabilities. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 33% (for the 2500 Euros outcome) + 66% (for the 2400 Euros outcome) = 99%. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 100% (for the 2400 Euros outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason is the aspiration level, the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level, and the probabilities of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A, the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries, and the 33% chance of an additional 100 Euros in Lottery A. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by stating that the higher expected value and the additional 100 Euros in 33% of the cases compensate for the 1% chance of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level, which are crucial for the decision reason. However, the individual did consider the probabilities of winning and the additional gain in Lottery A, which are related to the decision reason. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, while the individual justified the choice based on the expected value and the compensation for the 1% chance of winning nothing. The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, but it shows an awareness of the trade-offs between different aspects of the lotteries. Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason, but may have considered related factors.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, we need to calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 33% (the probability of winning 2500 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 34% (the probability of winning 2400 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value and that the gains and probabilities are very similar. They also considered the difference between the possible gains and the increase in the winning probability of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a slightly increased winning probability, given that the difference between the possible gains is not very high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences, which does not directly match the information considered by the individual (expected value, similarity of gains and probabilities, and the difference in winning probabilities).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual's choice of Lottery B due to its slightly higher winning probability. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration level or the calculation of positive differences as described in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations outlined in the decision reason, such as the aspiration level and the explicit consideration of positive differences. However, the individual's choice based on the higher winning probability of Lottery B shares a superficial similarity with the outcome of the decision reason's rule. The lack of direct reference to the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it in the verbal report suggests that the decision reason was not explicitly used. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but not entirely, given the indirect alignment in the choice based on probability."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B being slightly higher than that of Lottery A and the fact that Lottery A offers a secure gain while Lottery B only offers a chance at a slightly increased gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain, whereas Lottery B only offers a chance at a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values and the security of the gain, but did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, but the individual's justification focuses on the security of the gain in Lottery A rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Based on these two comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as there is no mention of aspiration levels or comparisons to such levels in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 4000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 1750 = 1250; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 1750 = -1750; for 4000 Euros, the difference is 4000 - 1750 = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Lottery A offers a positive difference (1250) with 25% probability, and Lottery B offers a positive difference (2250) with 20% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the expected value of Lottery B being slightly higher, the probability of winning in Lottery A being slightly higher, and the potential gain in Lottery B being significantly higher. The individual also notes that the probabilities are very similar.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B due to its higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discusses expected values, the probability of winning, and the potential gain without mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would require calculating the aspiration level and comparing probabilities of outcomes above this level. The individual’s justification focuses on the higher potential gain of Lottery B and does not explicitly mention probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the higher potential gain and similarities in probabilities rather than on calculating an aspiration level and evaluating the probabilities of positive differences from this level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0)/4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it is 90% (since the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high gain, and Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because the chance of winning (or gaining something) is significantly higher with B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and the amounts, which aligns with the components needed to calculate the aspiration level and differences, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B because it has a 90% chance of achieving an outcome (3000 Euros) that is above the aspiration level, compared to Lottery A's 45% chance of achieving an outcome (6000 Euros) above the aspiration level. The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B was because it offers a very high chance of winning (or gaining something), which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome but does not explicitly state it in terms of aspiration levels or differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with the general principle of preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome, the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference (3750) and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference (-2250), while Lottery B has a 0.2% chance of a positive difference (750) and a 99.8% chance of a negative difference (-2250). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers a chance at a twice-as-high win. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, given the low probability of winning for both lotteries, Lottery A offers a higher potential win, making it more desirable despite the low probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the expected value, the low probability of winning, and the comparative size of the potential win. The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level or the specific probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a higher potential win, not explicitly because of the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, as the aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences are not mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 20% probability of a positive difference (1000) and an 80% probability of a negative difference (-3000), while Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference and a 100% probability of a negative difference (-2000). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A and Lottery B, the fact that Lottery B offers a certain loss, and the probability of not incurring a loss with Lottery A. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, although it has a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B, it offers a good chance of not incurring a loss, which was deemed more important given that the magnitude of the losses in both lotteries is similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discussed expected values, the certainty of loss in Lottery B, and the chance of no loss in Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences from such a level. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual preferred Lottery A due to its chance of avoiding a loss and the similar magnitude of losses in both lotteries. The individual's justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from this level as the basis for their decision. Instead, the decision was based on expected values, the certainty of loss, and the chance of avoiding a loss, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes is (-3000 + 0 - 4000 + 0)/4 = -1750 Euros. The aspiration level is -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have a positive difference of 1750 Euros with probabilities of 75% and 80%, respectively, and a negative difference with probabilities of 25% and 20%, respectively, we need to compare these probabilities to determine which lottery is preferred by the reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the probability of loss for both lotteries, and the magnitude of the loss for both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a slightly higher expected value, both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss, the loss in Lottery A is lower and only marginally more probable than in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences between the outcomes and this level. The individual considered the expected value, probability of loss, and magnitude of loss, which does not directly involve calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences as specified by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 80% chance of a 1750 Euro positive difference (from the aspiration level to 0 Euros) compared to Lottery A's 75%. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value and the comparison of loss probabilities and magnitudes, not the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -3750 Euros; for 0 Euros, the difference is 2250 Euros; for -3000 Euros, the difference is 750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability, 
and Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability, 
we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) is 10%, and for Lottery B, it's 55%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, the high loss probability of both, but noted that Lottery A has a higher loss probability compared to Lottery B. They also noted that while a potential loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, the difference in probabilities makes Lottery B more favorable.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential loss, the lower probability of loss compared to Lottery A made it more appealing, seemingly prioritizing the avoidance of loss probability over the magnitude of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discussed expected values and the comparative probabilities of losses, not directly mentioning aspiration levels or the specific concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while emphasizing probabilities, focused on the avoidance of loss rather than the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and positive differences. The individual's emphasis was more on comparative loss probabilities and expected values rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, their justification and the information they considered did not directly align with the specifics of the decision reason regarding aspiration levels and the preference for positive differences. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but there is a slight overlap in the consideration of probabilities."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros; for Lottery B, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the positive difference (2250 Euros) is the same for both lotteries, we need to compare the probabilities of this positive difference. For Lottery A, the probability of the positive difference is 99.8%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.9%. However, since the decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences, and both lotteries have the same positive outcome (0 Euros), we should consider the probability of not getting the negative outcome. The probability of not getting the negative outcome for Lottery A is 99.8%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.9%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the possible loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, and the probabilities of losses are very low. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the loss is only half of the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the size of the losses and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. However, the individual's focus on the size of the loss and its probability indirectly relates to the concept of avoiding negative differences from an implicit aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but since both lotteries have the same positive outcome (0 Euros), the comparison shifts to the probability of not getting the negative outcome. The individual chose Lottery A because its loss is smaller, which aligns with avoiding larger negative deviations but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The individual's justification is more closely related to minimizing loss rather than explicitly considering the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the concern for negative outcomes, the primary reasoning path taken by the individual does not closely follow the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (1000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome equals the aspiration level), we need to consider how the individual's thought process aligns with this calculation.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries offer the same expected value and that Lottery B offers a certain gain of 500 Euros, while Lottery A has a possibility of winning nothing. The individual also considers the magnitude of the possible gains in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a certain gain, considering the risk of winning nothing in Lottery A and the similar magnitude of the possible gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B, the risk of winning nothing in Lottery A, and the expected values being equal. The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the certain gain because it avoids the risk of winning nothing, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule about positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level.

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (-500 + (-1000) + 0) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -500 - (-500) = 0; for Lottery B, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the positive difference (500) in Lottery B occurs with 50% probability and there's no positive difference in Lottery A, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, which are equal, and noted that Lottery A offers a certain loss of 500 Euros, while Lottery B offers a 50% chance of losing nothing. The individual also compared the losses in both lotteries, noting they are in a similar order of magnitude (1/4 vs 1/2 of the capital, though this part seems slightly misinterpreted as it doesn't directly apply to the given lotteries).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers the possibility of losing nothing, despite acknowledging the losses are in a similar magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the expected values, the certainty of loss in one lottery, and the possibility of no loss in the other, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a chance to lose nothing, which aligns with seeking a positive outcome (in this case, not losing) but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning touches on the idea of preferring an outcome that offers a possibility of a better result (in this case, losing nothing), which is somewhat aligned with the concept of seeking positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the individual does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The focus on expected values and the direct comparison of outcomes without reference to an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring higher probabilities of positive differences suggests that the decision reason was not directly used. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certain that the decision reason was not used, but with some minor alignment in the preference for a potential positive outcome."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2400 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2400 = 3600 and 0 - 2400 = -2400; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2400 = 1600, 2000 - 2400 = -400, and 0 - 2400 = -2400. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery A offers a chance at a high gain, and Lottery B offers a double chance at a similar or lower gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a double chance of a gain and the possible gain amounts are in the same order of magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences, while the individual considers the expected value and the chance of gains. The individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, while the individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a double chance of a gain. Although both considerations involve the concept of ""chance"" or ""probability,"" the specific focus on ""positive differences"" from an ""aspiration level"" is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the double chance of a gain and the similarity in the order of magnitude of the possible gains, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. While there is a superficial similarity in considering probabilities, the core elements of the decision reason (aspiration level, calculation of differences, preference based on probability of positive differences) are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since only the 0 Euro outcome is positive relative to the aspiration level), and in Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since the 0 Euro and -2000 Euro outcomes are positive relative to the aspiration level, but only the 0 Euro outcome and the -2000 Euro outcome with a probability of 25% each contribute to this, however, the -2000 Euro outcome is actually a negative difference, so only the 0 Euro outcome with a probability of 50% contributes to the positive difference, and the -2000 Euro outcome does not, so the correct probability is 50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, the probability of losses, and the magnitude of potential losses. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, although the probability of a loss is higher, the losses are smaller, and the maximum loss in Lottery A is greater than the possible losses in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level. However, the individual does consider the magnitude of losses and their probabilities, which is related to the concept of aspiration level and differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the smaller magnitude of losses in Lottery B and the higher probability of losses, but chooses B because its losses are ""absolut kleiner"" (absolutely smaller), which aligns with preferring outcomes that are closer to or less negative than the aspiration level, but does not directly address the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration level and probability of positive differences. While there is some indirect consideration of loss magnitudes and probabilities, the core elements of the decision reason (aspiration level calculation and comparison of probabilities of positive differences) are not explicitly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 = 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 = -1671.67 Euros; for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 = -1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 0.1% (since only the 5000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery A, there is no positive difference since the outcome is below the aspiration level. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, noted the low probability of winning in Lottery B, and recognized the guaranteed small win in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a small but certain gain, considering that only one round is relevant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual, however, discussed the expected value and the certainty of the gain in Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A for its certainty, not explicitly because of its relation to an aspiration level or the probability of exceeding such a level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from that level. The individual's choice was based on the certainty of the gain rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can derive the necessary information for the decision reason: the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, but focuses on the difference in the nature of the losses (a small, certain loss for Lottery B versus a very low-probability, very high loss for Lottery A).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the potential loss in Lottery A is much higher, even though very unlikely, compared to the small but certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focuses on the expected value and the nature of the losses (certain vs. probable), not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the lottery with the smaller certain loss, emphasizing the avoidance of a high potential loss, even if highly unlikely.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described, focusing instead on the expected value and the nature of the losses rather than an aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The mean of all outcomes (1500, 3000, -3000) is (1500 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0. Thus, the aspiration level is 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 1500 - 0 = 1500 for Lottery A, 3000 - 0 = 3000 for the positive outcome of Lottery B, and -3000 - 0 = -3000 for the negative outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1500 Euros) and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (3000 Euros) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-3000 Euros), the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A offers a secure gain, and Lottery B offers a chance at double the amount but also an equal chance at an equally high loss. They also considered the expected value of Lottery B, noting it is lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because it has a secure gain and a higher expected value compared to Lottery B, which has a lower expected value due to its potential for loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the security of the gain in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, as well as the expected values. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual did consider aspects related to the outcomes (security, potential for loss, and expected value), they did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The final assessment is 0 because, based on the verbal report, there is no explicit mention or indication that the individual considered the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from this level as the basis for their decision. The individual's justification is rooted in the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 2000 Euros

The aspiration level = (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 ≈ 666.67 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 666.67 ≈ 2333.33 (positive), -3000 - 666.67 ≈ -3666.67 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 2000 - 666.67 ≈ 1333.33 (positive)

Given the probabilities:
- Lottery A: 50% chance of a positive difference and 50% chance of a negative difference
- Lottery B: 100% chance of a positive difference

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B because it has a 100% chance of a positive difference compared to the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the security of the gain offered by Lottery B, its higher expected value compared to Lottery A, and the risk of a high loss associated with Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure gain and has a higher expected value compared to Lottery A, which has an equal chance of a high gain or a high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discussed the security of the gain, expected values, and the risk of loss, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which aligns with choosing Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on its secure gain and higher expected value, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (both prefer Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's justification is more aligned with expected value and risk considerations.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the outcome of the decision reason and the individual's choice align (both prefer Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not closely match the specific criteria and considerations of the decision reason, which focuses on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's reasoning appears more related to expected values and risk aversion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (1000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = approximately 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 Euros and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the aspiration level and the differences, we can proceed to analyze the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries (1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B), the possibility of a higher gain with Lottery B, and the equal probability of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by its secure gain of 1000 Euros, comparing it to the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had an equal probability to gaining 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the expected values and the risk of loss versus the secure gain. The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A because it offered a secure gain, avoiding the risk of loss associated with Lottery B. The individual's justification does not directly align with the rule of preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the security of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than on an aspiration level and probabilities of exceeding it.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. The aspiration level is thus (0 + 6000 - 6000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 0 Euros for Lottery A (since its outcome is 0 Euros), 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, and -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is 0 Euros) and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros), we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, recognizes the potential for high gain and loss in Lottery B, and understands that Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the possible loss in Lottery B is very high and has a moderate ( mittlere Wahrscheinlichkeit, which translates to ""medium probability"" but in this context likely means 50%, given the probabilities of the lotteries) probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the potential outcomes and the probabilities of gain and loss but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of outcomes being above this level. However, the individual does consider the potential for high loss and gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of differences from an aspiration level (in this case, 0 Euros, as it's the midpoint and the outcome of Lottery A).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery A because of the high potential loss in Lottery B, which suggests a focus on avoiding negative outcomes rather than seeking positive differences from an aspiration level. The individual's justification does not directly align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects related to the outcomes and their probabilities, the specific rule and focus of the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences) are not clearly reflected in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems more risk-averse, focusing on avoiding loss rather than seeking positive outcomes above an aspiration level. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."
