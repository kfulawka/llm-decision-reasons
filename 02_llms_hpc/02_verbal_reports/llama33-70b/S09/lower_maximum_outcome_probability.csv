Verbal report:
sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. 
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 33% for Lottery A's maximum outcome and 100% for Lottery B's maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions a ""sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen,"" which translates to ""very low probability of winning nothing."" 
This implies the individual considered the probability of not winning, which is 1% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B, as Lottery B guarantees a win of 2400 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the aspect of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, whereas the individual seems to focus on the probability of not winning, which is a different aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification, as described, does not explicitly address the comparison of the maximum outcomes' probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's criteria, which consider the probability of the maximum outcome. The verbal report discusses the probability of not winning, which is not the basis for the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which is 33% for Lottery B and 34% for Lottery A. Since Lottery B has a lower probability of its maximum outcome, according to the decision reason, Lottery B should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Sind sich zu identisch, daher nach Gefühl gewählt,"" which translates to ""They are too similar, so chosen by feeling."" This implies that the individual considered the lotteries to be very similar and made the choice based on intuition or feeling rather than a specific, identifiable criterion. The information considered by the individual seems to be the overall similarity between the two lotteries, and the justification for the choice is based on this perceived similarity and personal feeling, rather than on a detailed analysis of the outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the overall similarity between the lotteries), it's clear that the individual did not explicitly consider the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason dictates. The individual's justification for the choice, based on the perceived similarity and personal feeling, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. There is no indication in the verbal report that the individual considered or applied this specific rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a maximum outcome probability of 80%.
- Lottery B has a maximum outcome probability of 100%.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the good winning probability of Lottery A but also the fact that Lottery B guarantees a high amount of 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite Lottery A's good winning probability, the guarantee of a high amount from Lottery B was more appealing, especially considering the lower amounts (implied to be less significant in this context).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. However, the individual's consideration seems to weigh more towards the guarantee of a significant amount rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (80%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing its guarantee of a high amount as the reason, not the probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification and the factors they considered do not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The verbal report indicates the decision was influenced by the guarantee of a significant amount from Lottery B rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a 25% chance of its maximum outcome, and Lottery B has a 20% chance of its maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""5% lesser gain"" and a ""higher gain,"" which seems to refer to the differences in potential winnings between the two lotteries and possibly their probabilities. However, the specific probabilities or the exact nature of the ""5% lesser gain"" are not clearly defined in relation to the lotteries provided.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual believes ""the risk is worth it,"" implying that despite some form of risk or trade-off, they find the potential reward appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B. The individual's consideration of ""5% lesser gain"" could imply they are comparing probabilities or outcomes, but it's not directly clear how this relates to the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, ""the risk is worth it,"" suggests they are willing to take on risk for a higher potential reward, which could align with choosing Lottery B due to its higher maximum outcome despite (or because of) its lower probability of occurring.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the specific decision reason provided, which prioritizes the lottery with the lower probability of its maximum outcome. While the individual's choice might align with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (Lottery B), the justification provided (""the risk is worth it"") does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The mention of ""5% lesser gain"" and ""higher gain"" is somewhat ambiguous and does not directly correspond to the probabilities or the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, there is a low level of certainty that the decision reason was used."

Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, we can apply the decision reason to this decision problem. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: 45% chance of the maximum outcome (6000 Euros)
- Lottery B: 90% chance of the maximum outcome (3000 Euros)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""high win probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of winning in their deliberation process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but implies a focus on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of ""high win probability."" However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which contrasts with the individual's apparent preference for a ""high win probability.""
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome) does not align with the emphasis on ""high win probability"" in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on ""high win probability"" and the decision reason's preference for the lower probability of the maximum outcome indicate that the decision reason was not used by the individual. The verbal report suggests the individual was drawn to the higher probability of winning, which is opposite to what the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which can be derived from the given data. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 0.1% chance of winning 6000 Euros
- Lottery B: 0.2% chance of winning 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that both lotteries are very unlikely to occur, implying they considered the low probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states, ""Beide treten sehr unwahrscheinlich ein, daher geht man ein höheres Risiko ein,"" which translates to ""Both are very unlikely to occur, therefore one takes a higher risk."" This suggests the individual is aware of the low probabilities but does not explicitly state how they compare the two lotteries in terms of these probabilities or the specific outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which the individual seems to acknowledge as being low for both lotteries but does not explicitly compare.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification does not clearly indicate a preference based on the comparison of probabilities of the maximum outcomes but rather mentions taking a higher risk without specifying how this risk is evaluated between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the low probabilities of both lotteries but does not clearly demonstrate the use of the decision reason's specific rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) in making the decision. The mention of ""taking a higher risk"" could imply consideration of probabilities, but it does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."
7,"follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome (in terms of being the least negative) is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome (in terms of being the least negative, or in this case, not losing) is 0 Euros with a 20% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome (-3000 Euros) with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome (0 Euros) with 20% probability.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a small probability of defending against a loss and notes that if this doesn't happen, one doesn't lose much more than in Lottery A. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the potential for loss and its magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice by considering the potential loss and the probability of avoiding it, suggesting a risk assessment based on the potential outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, whereas the individual seems to consider the probability of avoiding a significant loss and the magnitude of potential losses. While there's some overlap in considering probabilities, the individual's focus is more on loss avoidance and less on the specific probability of the maximum outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, doesn't explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of its maximum outcome but rather on the basis of potential loss and the probability of avoiding it. This does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus was more on the risk of loss and its magnitude rather than the specific probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. In this case, the maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros (since the other outcomes are losses). For Lottery A, the probability of this outcome is 80%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of avoiding a loss (0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""leicht bessere Chancen einen Verlust zu vermeiden,"" which translates to ""slightly better chances of avoiding a loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of not incurring a loss (i.e., getting 0 Euros) in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about having better chances of avoiding a loss, which implies the individual's decision was influenced by the probability of not incurring a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: Both involve the probability of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome (in this case, avoiding a loss).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (avoiding a loss), which would be Lottery B with a 75% chance of avoiding a loss compared to Lottery A's 80%. The individual's justification of ""better chances of avoiding a loss"" suggests they preferred the option that aligns with this rule, although the verbal report does not explicitly state which lottery was chosen.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's consideration of avoiding a loss and the implicit preference for the lottery with a ""better chance"" of this outcome aligns with the decision reason's rule. However, the verbal report does not explicitly discuss the probabilities or directly compare them in a manner that perfectly matches the decision reason's criteria. Thus, while there's a strong alignment, the report's brevity and lack of explicit comparison introduce some uncertainty.

9,"-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (which is not a gain, but in the context of avoiding loss, it's the best outcome), and its probability is 55%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros (again, in the context of avoiding loss), and its probability is 10%. However, considering the context of ""maximum outcome"" typically refers to the best possible financial gain, it seems there might be an interpretation issue since both lotteries' best outcomes are 0 Euros, implying no loss. But given the decision reason's focus on the ""maximum outcome,"" we'll proceed under the assumption that it refers to avoiding the loss, hence the probability of not losing.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the higher potential loss in one of the lotteries but chose based on the higher probability of avoiding this loss. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the probability of avoiding a loss, which implies considering the likelihood of the better outcome (0 Euros, or no loss) in each lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome, or in this context, avoiding loss) with what the individual considered (the probability of avoiding loss), there seems to be alignment. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A with a 10% chance of 0 Euros (no loss), contrasting with the individual's choice that seems to prioritize avoiding loss based on higher probability, which would actually align more with preferring Lottery B due to its higher probability of not losing (55%). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual chose based on a higher probability of avoiding loss, which is not the same as the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome (or loss, in this context, since the outcomes are negative) of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum loss is -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. For Lottery A, the maximum loss is -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of these maximum losses: 0.1% for Lottery B and 0.2% for Lottery A. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because 0.1% is less than 0.2%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of incurring a loss is barely given (or very low) for both lotteries. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of the losses but does not specify comparing the probabilities of the maximum losses directly.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on ""Gefühl,"" which translates to ""feeling"" or intuition, without explicitly stating the comparison of the probabilities of the maximum losses or any specific criteria for the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of the maximum losses, while the individual notes the low probability of losses in general but does not specify focusing on the maximum losses or comparing their probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on intuition without mentioning this specific rule or comparison.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not explicitly mention using the probability of the maximum outcome as the basis for their decision, nor do they articulate a preference based on this criterion. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was explicitly used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability.
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (50% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) and its ""Höhe"" (height or amount).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the secure win due to its amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, whereas the individual considered the security and amount of the win. The individual's focus does not directly align with the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as required by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. In contrast, the individual's justification emphasizes the security and amount of the win, not the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's reasoning does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros, but since it's the only outcome, its probability is 100%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome (0 Euros) with 50% probability.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome (-500 Euros) with 100% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""Risiko"" (risk), suggesting they considered the uncertainty or risk associated with the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states, ""Ist mir das Risiko wert, da es auch für einen Spieler uninteressant sein sollte das sichere Ergebnis zu wählen,"" which translates to ""Is the risk worth it, because for a player, it should also be uninteresting to choose the certain outcome."" This implies the individual considered the trade-off between risk and the certainty of an outcome, suggesting they might be looking for a potential upside or are averse to certain losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual discusses risk and the appeal of avoiding a certain outcome. There's an indirect connection since the concept of risk might encompass the probability of outcomes, but the individual's focus seems more on the presence of risk rather than specifically on the probability of the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (50% probability of 0 Euros). The individual's justification hints at a preference for risk over certainty, which could align with choosing Lottery A due to its gamble nature, but it does not directly address the probability of the maximum outcome as the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report touches upon risk and the avoidance of certain outcomes, which aligns somewhat with the concept of considering probabilities of outcomes. However, the report does not directly address the probability of the maximum outcome as the central criterion for the decision, which is what the decision reason specifically considers. Therefore, while there's a slight connection, it's clear that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's decision, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 25%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 25%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report is in German and translates to ""Seems something safer to me, to win something at all."" The individual considers the aspect of winning something as opposed to possibly winning nothing. The justification for the choice focuses on the perceived safety of winning any amount, rather than specifically comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the safety of winning something), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual's focus is on avoiding the outcome of winning nothing, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these probabilities. The individual's reasoning appears to prioritize the guarantee of some winnings over the specific probabilities of the maximum amounts, which does not directly align with the decision reason provided.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes, which is the core of the decision reason. The individual's focus on ""winning something"" suggests a different decision-making process."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a lower probability (50%) of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery A (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringere Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""lower loss probability."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of losing (or not winning) in their deliberation. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for the choice between the two lotteries but implies a focus on minimizing loss or avoiding outcomes with high probabilities of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (which, in this context, is avoiding loss or 0 Euros), and the individual considered the probability of loss, which aligns with focusing on the maximum outcome (0 Euros) in terms of avoiding negative outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros), which is Lottery B with 50%. The individual's mention of ""lower loss probability"" suggests they might have preferred the option that minimizes the risk of significant loss, which could align with preferring Lottery B due to its structure, even though the specific focus is on loss rather than the maximum outcome of 0 Euros.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment suggests that while there are indications the individual considered aspects related to the decision reason (such as probabilities of certain outcomes), the direct application of the decision reason as stated (focusing on the probability of the maximum outcome to prefer the lottery with the lower probability of this outcome) is not explicitly clear from the verbal report. The individual's focus on ""lower loss probability"" could be interpreted as aligning with the decision reason's general direction but does not perfectly match the reason's specific criteria. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty."

The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 5 Euros
- Lottery B: 0.1% chance of 5000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the winning probability of Lottery B (""Die Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit bei Lotterie 2 war so gut wie 0""), which translates to ""The winning probability in Lottery 2 was almost 0"". This indicates the individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the low winning probability of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the winning probability of Lottery B but did not explicitly mention comparing it with the probability of the maximum outcome of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's report highlights the very low probability of winning in Lottery B but does not explicitly state a preference based on this rule.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual focused on the low probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery B, which aligns partially with the decision reason. However, the report lacks explicit comparison with Lottery A's outcome probability and a clear statement of preference based on the rule of lower probability for the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery B, which is part of the decision reason, the verbal report does not fully align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, nor does it provide a clear comparison with Lottery A's certain outcome. Thus, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, leaning towards it not being the primary reason due to the lack of explicit comparison and justification."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a probability of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 99.9% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringe Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""low probability of loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing (or not winning) in the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification but implies a focus on the probability of loss or a negative outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual seems to consider the probability of loss. These are related but not exactly the same, as the maximum outcome in this context (0 Euros for Lottery A) is not a loss but rather a neutral outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, as inferred, seems to prioritize avoiding loss, which could align with preferring a lower probability of a significant loss but does not directly address the probability of the maximum outcome as defined by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the probability of loss and the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome do not perfectly align. However, the essence of avoiding or minimizing risk (in terms of loss or less favorable outcomes) could suggest some level of alignment, albeit indirect. The verbal report does not provide a clear, direct connection to the decision reason's specific criteria but does indicate a risk-averse mindset that could tangentially relate to preferring lower probabilities of undesirable outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a probability of 100%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the potential high gain from Lottery B but is swayed by the possibility of a high loss, leading them to choose the certain outcome of Lottery A. The information considered by the individual includes the potential high gain and the risk of loss associated with Lottery B, as well as the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the security of the outcome, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the potential gain, risk of loss, and certainty of outcomes), it appears the individual did not directly consider the probability of the maximum outcome as the basis for their decision. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (50% chance of the maximum outcome of 3000 Euros compared to a 100% chance of the maximum outcome of 1500 Euros in Lottery A). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes but rather focuses on the attractiveness of the certain gain over the risk associated with Lottery B. Therefore, the decision reason's rule does not align with the individual's stated justification for choosing Lottery A.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. 
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the risk of loss and gain in Lottery A and compares it to the certainty of a high amount in another option (implied to be Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to be swayed by the certainty of a high amount, implying that the risk associated with Lottery A, despite its potential for higher gain, is less favorable when a significant amount can be obtained with certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a criterion for the decision. The individual discusses risk and certainty, not the probability of the maximum outcome per se.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. In this case, that would be Lottery A (50% probability of the maximum outcome). However, the individual’s justification suggests a preference for certainty (Lottery B) over the risk associated with Lottery A, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty of gain and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes, and the preference for the certain option (Lottery B) over the risky one (Lottery A), indicates that the decision reason considering the probability of the maximum outcome was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 50% probability of the maximum outcome (3000 Euros)
- Lottery B: 100% probability of the maximum outcome (1000 Euros)
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the risk associated with Lottery A and the certain gain of Lottery B, indicating they are weighing the pros and cons of each option.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the certain gain at B is so low that they are willing to take the risk associated with A. This implies they are considering the trade-off between risk and reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key consideration. The individual discusses risk and the size of the certain gain, not directly addressing the probability of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual, however, seems to prefer Lottery A despite its higher risk (and lower probability of the maximum outcome being a gain, but higher potential gain), because the certain gain of B is too low. This does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason to make their choice, as their justification does not focus on the probability of the maximum outcome but rather on the risk and the size of the certain gain.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: 50% probability of the maximum outcome (6000 Euros)
- Lottery B: 100% probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""zu großes Verlustrisiko bei A"", which translates to ""too high loss risk at A"". This indicates the individual considered the risk of losing (the negative outcome) in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus on the loss risk suggests they were concerned about the potential negative outcome of Lottery A, but the specific justification for choosing one lottery over the other is not explicitly stated in terms of comparing probabilities of maximum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considered the risk of loss, which is related but not directly about comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's concern about the loss risk in Lottery A does not directly reflect this rule, as the concern is about the risk of loss rather than the probability of the maximum gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the probability of the maximum outcome as the basis for their decision, which is what the decision reason is based on. The focus on ""too high loss risk"" suggests a different consideration than the probability of the maximum outcome, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
