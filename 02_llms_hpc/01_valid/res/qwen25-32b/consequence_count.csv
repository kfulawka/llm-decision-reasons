Decision reason:
The reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons.
assistant
STEPS: 
1. First, we assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly. We need to determine the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery.
   - For Lottery A: 
     - Maximum outcome: 2500 Euros
     - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
   - For Lottery B:
     - Maximum outcome: 2400 Euros
     - Minimum outcome: 2400 Euros (since it has only one outcome)

2. Next, we compare the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries:
   - Maximum outcomes comparison: 2500 Euros (Lottery A) > 2400 Euros (Lottery B)
   - Minimum outcomes comparison: 0 Euros (Lottery A) < 2400 Euros (Lottery B)

3. According to the decision reason, we count the number of favorable comparisons:
   - Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome: 1 favorable comparison
   - Lottery B has a higher minimum outcome: 1 favorable comparison

Since there is an equal number of favorable comparisons for both lotteries (1 each), the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons.
assistant
STEPS:
1. **Assessing applicability of the decision reason**: The decision reason focuses on comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes between the lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros (with 80% probability) and 0 Euros (with 20% probability). For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros (with 100% probability).

   - Maximum outcome for Lottery A: 0 Euros
