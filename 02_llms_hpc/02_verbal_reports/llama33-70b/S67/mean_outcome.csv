STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes and the number of outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the certain option of winning 2400 Euros (Lottery B) versus the uncertain option of potentially winning 2500 Euros but also risking winning nothing (Lottery A). 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was that the certain option was more valuable to them than the uncertain option, primarily due to the risk of winning nothing and the small difference of only 100 Euros between the maximum outcome of Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated by summing all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome, risk of winning nothing, and the difference between the outcomes), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual focused on the certainty of the outcome and the potential risk, rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the certain option due to risk aversion and the small difference in potential outcomes), it is clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual chose Lottery B, which has a lower mean outcome according to the decision reason, but offered certainty.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning as very low and wanted to increase the probability by 1%. They also considered the difference in potential winnings (100 Euros more in one option) but did not find it enough to take on higher risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the perceived risk and the marginal increase in potential winnings, rather than a direct comparison of the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on risk assessment and marginal potential gain, not on comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, does not appear to be directly applied in the individual's justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason, which calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries, to make their decision. The focus on risk and marginal gain in the report does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""Sicherheit zu gewinnen"" which translates to ""security of winning"" or certainty of gain, implying they looked at the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and possibly the risk associated with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual would have chosen B only if the possible sum (of Lottery A) had been significantly higher, indicating they compared the potential gains but prioritized the certainty of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, while the individual considered the certainty of winning and compared potential gains but not explicitly the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of gain rather than the calculated mean of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus on the certainty of winning and the comparison of potential gains without explicit mention of calculating mean outcomes suggests they did not use the given decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible amount to be won in each lottery and the probabilities of winning in each lottery. They noted that the possible amount to be won was higher in Lottery B, but the probability of winning was slightly higher in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""riskier"" option (Lottery B) because the possible amount to be won was higher, despite the slightly lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the possible amount to be won and the probabilities, but did not mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B, but their justification is based on the possible amount to be won and the willingness to take on more risk, not explicitly on the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the specific rule of comparing mean outcomes to make their decision. The justification provided in the report focuses on the potential winnings and risk, not the mean outcome calculation. Therefore, while the outcome of the decision matches the decision reason, the process described does not clearly align with the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""90% chance to win"" as a significant factor and compares it to ""a somewhat higher sum with fewer winning chances."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities and the amounts of the winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize the higher probability of winning (90% in Lottery B) over the potentially higher amount with lower winning chances (Lottery A).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities or the specific amounts of the winnings in the context of their probabilities. The individual, however, emphasizes the probability of winning and the amount of the winnings in a probabilistic context, not the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery A), based solely on the mean calculation. The individual's justification, however, prioritizes the higher probability of winning, which aligns with choosing Lottery B, not necessarily based on the mean outcome as calculated by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of winning and the comparison of the amounts in the context of these probabilities, as opposed to calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries as per the decision reason, indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1500 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both options and the fact that neither option was really secure. They also considered the amount of the potential win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the higher potential win (despite its lower probability) because they did not expect to win anyway and hoped for luck, implying they prioritized the potential gain over the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered both the outcomes and their probabilities, as well as the concept of luck and security.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual also chose the option with the higher potential win (Lottery A), but their justification involves more than just the mean outcome; it includes considerations of probability, security, and luck.

Given these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, their justification and the factors they considered go beyond the simple calculation of mean outcomes used by the decision reason. The individual's process seems more nuanced, incorporating elements not directly related to the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros, and since there's only one outcome, the mean is -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -3000 is greater than -2000. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B and the difference between losing 3000 and 4000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the potential upside of not losing anything with Lottery B and downplays the difference between the losses of the two lotteries, calling both options ""kacke"" (which translates to ""crap"" or something similarly negative), indicating dissatisfaction with both but possibly leaning towards the lesser of two evils based on the specific aspects mentioned.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, whereas the individual discusses the possibility of no loss and the difference in loss amounts, not explicitly mentioning mean outcomes or calculating them as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a calculation of mean outcomes or a preference based on such a calculation. Instead, the individual seems to weigh the potential for no loss against the magnitude of potential losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make the choice. The focus is on different aspects (possibility of no loss and comparative loss amounts), and there's no mention or implication of calculating mean outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A is higher than that of Lottery B, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losing a large sum of money and the difference in the amounts that could be lost between the two lotteries. They also took into account the relatively high probability of losing, but found the 5% difference in probabilities (between 75% and 80%) not to be decisive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the lower potential loss (-3000 Euros) because of the risk of losing a high sum, indicating that the potential loss amount was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the risk of losing a high sum and the difference in potential losses, rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), which aligns with the individual's choice. However, the justification provided by the individual is based on the risk of losing a high sum and the potential loss amount, not on calculating mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the specific rule of calculating mean outcomes to make their decision. The focus was on the risk of high losses and potential loss amounts rather than mean outcomes, suggesting that while the outcome might align with the decision reason, the reasoning process itself was different."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A would be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to consider the large sums and their associated probabilities, mentioning the ""größere Summe"" (larger sum) and ""Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (probability), indicating they are weighing the potential gains against the risks.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification revolves around not wanting to lose, especially with lower probabilities, and finds the larger sum tempting enough to consider despite its lower probability. This suggests a focus on the potential outcomes and their probabilities, but the exact calculation or comparison method used by the individual is not clearly stated.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires only the outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual seems to consider both the outcomes and their probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated without considering probabilities, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, hints at a consideration of both the magnitude of potential losses and gains and their probabilities, not strictly adhering to the mean outcome rule.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason as defined, which ignores probabilities and focuses solely on the mean of the outcomes. The individual's consideration of probabilities and the temptation of larger sums despite lower probabilities suggests a more nuanced decision-making process than the one outlined by the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because -1500 is greater than -3000. The relevant information for this decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, the low probability of losing, and compared it with Lottery B, implied by ""lieber b"" (prefer B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the fear of losing 6000 Euros and the low probability of this loss, leading to a preference for Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential loss and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual's final preference for Lottery B. However, the justification provided in the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes but rather focuses on the fear of loss and its probability.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason (calculating and comparing mean outcomes) was the basis for the individual's decision. The individual's justification seems to be more related to risk aversion and the fear of significant loss rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of gaining money versus the risk of losing (50/50 chance), and they think 500 Euros is a significant amount of money. They prioritize avoiding the risk of getting nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the certainty of gaining 500 Euros over the risk of getting nothing, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which does not directly involve considering risk or certainty. In contrast, the individual's consideration is heavily influenced by the risk of losing and the certainty of gaining a significant amount of money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule leads to indifference between the two lotteries because they have the same mean outcome, whereas the individual clearly prefers Lottery B due to its certainty, not because of the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome, which does not align with the decision reason that considers the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome based on this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference between 1000 and 500 Euros and the 50% chance of not losing anything with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize the 50% chance of not losing anything with Lottery B over the guaranteed loss of 500 Euros in Lottery A, indicating a willingness to take a risk to potentially avoid loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the difference between potential losses and the chance of not losing anything.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual's justification suggests a preference for Lottery B based on the chance of avoiding loss, not the mean outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by summing all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""gewinnchance bei b höher"" which translates to ""chance of winning at B is higher,"" indicating they considered the probabilities of winning in Lottery B. They also mention ""gewinnchance ist wichtiger für mich als summe"" which translates to ""chance of winning is more important to me than the sum,"" indicating they prioritized the probability of winning over the amount won.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the probability of winning being higher in Lottery B and this being more important to them than the total amount that could be won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and number of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the importance of winning). The individual's considerations do not directly align with the information required for the decision reason, as they focus on probabilities rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the higher chance of winning). The individual's justification is based on the probability of winning, not the mean outcome of the lotteries, which indicates a different decision-making criterion.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes to make their decision. Instead, their decision was influenced by the perceived higher chance of winning in one of the lotteries.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high percentages of losing and the specific probabilities (25% and 50%) associated with losing in both lotteries. They also mentioned the risk associated with the 25% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk of losing and the comparison of the probabilities of losing in both lotteries, rather than on the calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the outcomes of the lotteries to calculate the mean, but the individual's focus was more on the probabilities and the risk of losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes, which does not align with the individual’s justification that focuses on the comparison of losing probabilities and the hope of avoiding the 25% risk.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5 Euros) / 1 = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 2500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be considering the safety of the gain (""lieber safer gewinn"") versus the attractiveness of a higher but uncertain gain (""sehr unsafer hoher gewinn""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual is torn between the safety of a smaller gain and the allure of a potentially much higher but risky gain, indicated by ""trotzdem verlockend"" (nevertheless tempting).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers safety and the attractiveness of potential gains, not directly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on calculated mean outcomes but rather on the perceived safety and attractiveness of the gains.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus is on the safety and attractiveness of the potential gains rather than a calculated comparison of mean outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (-5 > -2500). The relevant information for the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the minimal risk of losing a significant amount in Lottery B and the certainty of losing a small amount in Lottery A. They took into account the low probability of losing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they were willing to take a minimal risk of losing a lot to avoid losing any amount with certainty, as would have been the case with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk, probability, and avoiding certain loss. The individual's considerations (risk, probability, and certainty of loss) do not explicitly match the calculation of mean outcomes independent of their probabilities as suggested by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on accepting a minimal risk of a significant loss to avoid a certain small loss, not on comparing mean outcomes. This indicates that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""sicherer gewinn besser, als große wahrscheinlichkeit etwas verlieren zu können"", which translates to ""a secure win is better than a high probability of losing something"". This suggests the individual considered the certainty of a gain in Lottery B and the risk of loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to prioritize the security of a win over the risk of losing, which implies a preference for Lottery B due to its guaranteed positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the security of a win and the risk of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual's preference for a secure win (also Lottery B). However, the reasoning behind this preference differs; the decision reason is based on mean outcomes, while the individual's reasoning is based on risk aversion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a preference for the secure gain of Lottery B, driven by a desire to avoid loss, rather than a calculation of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. While the choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, the underlying reasoning process described in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain and the danger of losing, indicating a focus on the risk aspect and the guarantee of a positive outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the desire for a certain gain and the fear of losing, mentioning that they would only consider the risky option for much larger sums. This suggests a risk-averse attitude, prioritizing guaranteed gains over potential higher rewards that come with risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain, danger of losing): The individual's considerations do not directly align with calculating mean outcomes but focus more on the certainty and risk associated with each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prioritizing certainty and expressing risk aversion): The decision reason's rule does not directly match the individual's justification, which emphasizes risk aversion and the desire for certainty rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a decision-making process focused on risk aversion and the desire for certain gains, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability, so the mean outcome is 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because its mean outcome (1000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which can be derived from the given outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the secure 1000 Euros were decisive and that the risk of losing with Lottery B was too high. This indicates the individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the security of the outcome of Lottery A and the perceived high risk of losing with Lottery B. The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes but focuses on the certainty of the gain with Lottery A and the risk of loss with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which involves a calculation based on all possible outcomes. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A and the risk of loss with Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning a calculation of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would lead to choosing Lottery A. The individual chooses Lottery A but justifies this choice based on the security of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B, not explicitly on the basis of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the security of its outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than on the calculation and comparison of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it appears the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 Euros, as there is only one outcome of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the attractiveness of 6000 Euros but expresses a high fear of losing it, given a 50% probability. This indicates the individual considered the potential gain and the risk (probability of loss) associated with Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the emotional aspect of potential loss rather than a direct comparison of the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are the same for both (0 Euros). However, the individual's consideration focuses on the potential gain and the fear of loss due to the probability, not directly on the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent between the two. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing mean outcomes or being indifferent based on this criterion; instead, it highlights an emotional response to the risk.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was more on the emotional and probabilistic aspects rather than the mean outcome calculation.
