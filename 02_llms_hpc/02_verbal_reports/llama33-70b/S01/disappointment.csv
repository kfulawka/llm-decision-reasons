STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, making the difference 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, since it has a 100% chance of this outcome, making the difference 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a 100% chance of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences. Instead, the individual focused on the certainty of the outcome (100% chance).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but justified it based on its 100% chance of winning, not the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its certainty (100% chance of winning), not on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason suggests. This indicates that the decision reason, which specifically considers the differences between outcomes, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the gains (outcomes) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to achieve a gain, implying they focused on the probabilities of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains): The individual's focus was on probabilities and outcomes themselves, not explicitly on the differences between the outcomes within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and the minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on the likelihood of achieving a gain): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there is no mention of comparing the outcome differences between the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision. The focus was instead on the probability of achieving a gain.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 3000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome. The difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. The difference is 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a difference of 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain, implying they focused on the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which directly relates to the concept of certainty (a difference of 0 Euros implies certainty). The individual considered all outcomes and probabilities, which encompasses the information needed to calculate these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which aligns with preferring a lottery where the outcome is certain (as this implies a difference of 0). The individual’s justification for choosing the lottery with a certain win aligns with the decision reason’s preference for smaller outcome differences, as certainty (Lottery A) is essentially the smallest possible difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the amounts (Beträge) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potential to win the higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual considered the potential to win the higher amount, not explicitly the differences between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's justification is based on winning the higher amount, not on the difference between the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts (Beträge) and probabilities (Wahrscheinlichkeiten) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the differences between the outcomes, but the individual considered amounts and probabilities, not explicitly the differences between outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between outcomes (which would be Lottery B), but the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning, not the difference in outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning, not the outcome differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. Since these differences can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a smaller difference (3000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of both lotteries. They noticed that the probabilities of winning are similarly low for both lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that promises a higher win because the probability of winning is similarly low for both.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration, as described, focuses on the outcomes and the similarity in low winning probabilities, not explicitly on the differences between the outcomes within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes (which would be Lottery A), but the individual's justification is based on choosing the lottery with the higher potential win due to similarly low probabilities of winning, which aligns with choosing Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the higher potential win and the similarity in low winning probabilities, without mention of considering the differences between the outcomes within each lottery, indicates that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery B has a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries and focused on the possibility of not incurring a loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that has the possibility of not incurring a loss and did not find the difference between a loss of 3000 Euros and 4000 Euros to be significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key consideration. Instead, the individual focused on the possibility of not incurring a loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding a loss and not finding the difference between losses significant, not directly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was more on avoiding any loss and the perceived significance of the difference in potential losses rather than on the specific rule of minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within a lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, it is not a 0 because the choice of Lottery B could indirectly align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a smaller outcome difference, but the reasoning provided does not clearly support this as the basis for the decision."

The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the probability of not incurring a loss, which translates to choosing the lottery where it is more likely to get the maximum outcome (0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it appears the individual focused on the aspect of not incurring a loss rather than directly on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and the minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery where it is more likely to not incur a loss), it seems the individual's reasoning is more aligned with avoiding losses based on probability rather than directly comparing outcome ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's justification for the choice, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be driven by the probability of avoiding a loss, which is a different criterion than the one specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more probable to achieve no loss (or, in other words, to not incur a negative outcome).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, whereas the individual considered all outcomes and probabilities but specifically mentions the probability of not incurring a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual’s justification, however, is about minimizing the probability of a loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it has a higher probability (90%) of not resulting in a loss (-3000 Euros) compared to Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the probability of not incurring a loss indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a smaller difference between outcomes (since the reason would also prefer Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the differences between the outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the choice made, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the decision reason's criteria.

The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was to select the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss. The described deliberation process focuses on the probabilities of avoiding a loss, rather than directly comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) does not directly match the information considered by the individual (probabilities and gains, with a focus on avoiding loss). 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss). 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus was on avoiding loss rather than on the differences between outcomes.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered all probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is that they chose the lottery where a win definitely occurs. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (all probabilities and amounts), it appears the individual considered more than just the differences between outcomes but also looked at the certainty of winning. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (chose the lottery where a win definitely occurs), the individual's justification aligns with preferring Lottery A because it has a guaranteed win, which indirectly relates to having a smaller difference between its outcomes (0 Euros difference in Lottery A vs. 1000 Euros difference in Lottery B). However, the individual's justification focuses on the certainty of winning rather than explicitly mentioning the differences between outcomes. 

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with the preference for the lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes (due to the guaranteed win in Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention the consideration of outcome differences as the reason for the choice. The focus on a guaranteed win could be interpreted as related to but not directly the same as the decision reason provided. Thus, there is a degree of certainty that the decision reason was used, but it is not a perfect match."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries and framed their decision as a risk decision, noting the possibility of not incurring a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual made a risk decision, focusing on the possibility of avoiding loss, which implies considering the potential outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on probabilities, amounts, and the possibility of avoiding loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding loss and considering risk, which doesn't explicitly mention the difference between outcomes within each lottery.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason emphasizes the difference in outcomes within each lottery, while the individual focuses on avoiding loss and considering risk in a more general sense.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (4000 Euros) between its maximum and minimum outcomes compared to Lottery B (6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities and chose the lottery with more events promising a win despite having the same probabilities of winning compared to the other lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification focuses on the number of events that promise a win and the comparison of probabilities of winning between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of the number of winning events and their associated probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which does not match the individual's justification that emphasizes the number of winning events and comparative probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason's focus on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes does not align with the individual's focus on the number of winning events and comparative probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros, making the difference between the maximum (0 Euros) and minimum (-4000 Euros) 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros, making the difference between the maximum (0 Euros) and minimum (-6000 Euros) 6000 Euros. Since we can derive these differences, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is most probable to achieve no loss (i.e., 0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery, which doesn't directly align with considering probabilities of achieving no loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is Lottery A with a 4000 Euro difference. The individual's justification, however, is about minimizing the probability of loss, not directly about outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries, indicating they looked at the basic components of each lottery.
Second, the individual's justification for their choice was based on selecting the lottery where a win is definitely expected, implying they chose based on the certainty of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts), it seems the individual did consider the outcomes but not explicitly the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason requires.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with a definite win), the individual's justification does align with preferring Lottery A, which has a smaller difference (0 Euros) and guarantees a win, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention the consideration of outcome differences as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The justification provided focuses on the certainty of a win rather than the outcome differences, suggesting that while the choice might align with the decision reason, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the application of this specific decision reason."

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to achieve no loss. This implies the individual focused on avoiding a loss and considered the probabilities of not losing in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the likelihood of not losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between its outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification is about choosing the lottery with a higher likelihood of not losing, which also leads to choosing Lottery A because it has a 0% chance of losing more than -5 Euros, but the reasoning provided does not explicitly mention considering the range of outcomes as the basis for the decision.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's focus on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. The individual's justification is more about avoiding loss, which indirectly leads to the same choice but through a different consideration.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual as the basis for their decision, given the mismatch between the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and the individual's stated focus on avoiding loss. However, it is not a 0 because the choice made by the individual happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest, even if for different reasons."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 6000 Euros for Lottery B and 0 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain, implying they prioritized the guarantee of a positive outcome over the potential for a higher or lower outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes, which is implicitly considered by the individual when they mention choosing a lottery with a certain win, as this implies avoiding the risk of a negative outcome (a key aspect of the difference in outcomes).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it has no risk (0 Euro difference) compared to Lottery B (6000 Euro difference). The individual's justification for choosing the certain win aligns with preferring a smaller difference in outcomes, as it ensures no loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's focus on a ""sicher"" (certain) win directly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smallest difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which in this case is Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. This alignment indicates a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the expectation of a guaranteed win, implying that the individual focused on the certainty of a positive outcome in one of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (all outcomes and probabilities, with a focus on guaranteed win), it appears that the individual did consider the outcomes but the focus was more on the certainty of a win rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a guaranteed win), the individual's justification aligns with preferring Lottery A because it has a guaranteed positive outcome, which indirectly aligns with having a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes (since the difference is 0). However, the individual's reasoning as stated does not explicitly mention the range of outcomes as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's focus on a guaranteed win could be seen as related but not directly equivalent to the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, there is some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used, but the outcome of the decision and some aspects of the reasoning process align."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 1000 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are: 
- Lottery A: difference = 6000 Euros
- Lottery B: difference = 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would achieve a certain gain (sicher einen Gewinn erziele), implying they prioritized the guarantee of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is related to but not directly mentioned in the individual's consideration of outcomes and probabilities. However, the individual's focus on achieving a certain gain indirectly aligns with preferring a smaller difference between outcomes, as Lottery B's certain outcome (1000 Euros) can be seen as having no variability (or the smallest possible difference). 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which aligns with the individual's choice of Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed outcome with no variability (difference of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing the lottery with a certain gain aligns with the principle of minimizing the difference between outcomes, as it ensures no loss and a fixed gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's preference for minimal outcome difference and the individual's choice based on achieving a certain gain. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention the differences between outcomes as the deciding factor."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same (0 Euros), so the difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that seemed to guarantee no loss. This implies the individual focused on avoiding negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes, which can be indirectly related to avoiding losses since a smaller difference implies less risk of a significant loss. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, which includes the information necessary to calculate these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which aligns with preferring a lottery that guarantees no loss, as this would have a difference of 0 (the smallest possible difference). The individual's justification for choosing the lottery that guarantees no loss aligns with the principle of minimizing the difference between outcomes, as Lottery A has no risk of loss (difference of 0).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and choosing the lottery that guarantees no loss directly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smallest difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. This suggests a strong alignment between the decision reason and the individual's deliberation process, indicating that the decision reason was likely used by the individual."
