STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 2400 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: 2500 Euros with 33% probability
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the guaranteed win in Lottery A and the potential for a higher win in Lottery B, but also notes the risk of winning nothing. They mention the difference in the highest possible outcomes between the two lotteries (100 Euros more in B) and express that this difference is not worth the risk of potentially winning nothing.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential extra 100 Euros in Lottery B are not worth the risk of possibly winning nothing, implying that the certainty of a win in Lottery A is more important to them than the potential for a slightly higher win in Lottery B. They also mention that the probabilities in B are not decisive for their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. While the individual does consider the outcomes and the risk associated with Lottery B, they do not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries. Instead, they focus on the certainty of a win in Lottery A versus the risk and potential reward in Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on the certainty of a win and the risk associated with the potential higher reward, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes in each lottery.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. They were more concerned with the certainty of a win and the perceived risk than with comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 33% chance of 2500 Euros
- Lottery B: 34% chance of 2400 Euros
This information is relevant to the decision reason, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the potential gain (100 Euros more in Lottery A) and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries (1 percentage point difference), but states that this difference plays no role in their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by mentioning the potential to win 100 Euros more, implying that the difference in potential winnings was a significant factor, while the small difference in probabilities was not considered important.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B. However, the individual does not mention considering these probabilities as the basis for their decision; instead, they focus on the potential gain and dismiss the small difference in probabilities without considering its implications on the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (34% vs. 33%). However, the individual chooses Lottery A based on the potential to win more, not the probability of winning the maximum amount. This indicates that the individual did not follow the rule of the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the aspect of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (a safe win), indicating a focus on avoiding risk. The individual mentions the 20% chance of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A as a reason for not choosing it, suggesting they considered the probabilities associated with the outcomes. The justification for the choice emphasizes the desire for ""Gewinnmaximierung mit möglichst wenig Risiko"" (profit maximization with as little risk as possible), indicating that the decision was influenced by the trade-off between the potential gain and the risk involved. The individual also mentions that the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries is not significant to them.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome) with that considered by the individual, it appears that the individual did consider the probabilities (especially the risk of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A), but the primary focus was on the concept of a ""safe win"" and minimizing risk rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B with a 100% probability of its maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on avoiding the risk associated with Lottery A, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since Lottery B has a 100% probability of its outcome, but it's more about risk aversion than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome suggested by the decision reason (preferring Lottery B due to its certainty), the reasoning process described in the verbal report focuses more on risk aversion and the concept of a ""safe win"" rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason would dictate. The individual's justification does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it's somewhat uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, but there's a leaning towards its influence due to the emphasis on certainty and risk avoidance."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability of this maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 20% chance of 4000 Euros
- Lottery B: 25% chance of 3000 Euros
This information is relevant and can be used to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the probabilities of the lotteries but mentions they are too close to be decisive. The focus is on the amount of the potential win (Gewinnsumme), and the second option (0 Euros) in both lotteries is considered not relevant for the decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual prefers the 20% chance of 4000 Euros over the slightly higher chance of 3000 Euros, indicating a focus on the magnitude of the potential win rather than the probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual seems to focus more on the magnitude of the potential win, mentioning that the probabilities are too close to be the deciding factor.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for the higher potential win (4000 Euros) despite its lower probability compared to the 3000 Euros option, which has a higher probability.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual's decision was influenced by the magnitude of the potential win.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of both lotteries) can be derived from the given lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of winning (or not winning) in both lotteries and the amount of the potential win. Specifically, they mention the high probability of winning in Lottery B but note it's not certain, and they compare it to the ""almost 50/50"" chance in Lottery A, focusing on the potential to win a high sum.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides against Lottery B because its win probability, although high, is not 100%. They choose Lottery A because of the potential to win a high sum and the lack of 100% win certainty in Lottery B, which implies they value the higher potential payout despite the lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 45% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B. The individual considers the probabilities and the amounts but seems to prioritize the potential for a high win and the lack of certainty in B, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability (90%) of achieving its maximum outcome compared to Lottery A (45%). However, the individual chooses Lottery A, citing the potential for a higher win and the absence of certainty in Lottery B, not directly applying the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not directly apply the decision reason as described. They prioritize different aspects (the potential win amount and the lack of certainty) rather than solely the probability of achieving the maximum outcome in each lottery.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. In this decision problem, the maximum outcomes are 6000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A, with probabilities of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability
This information indicates that Lottery A has a higher probability of its maximum outcome than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the high reward of each lottery and notes that in both cases, the probability of winning is very low. They also acknowledge that both lotteries have the same alternative outcome (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the probability of winning (0.1% vs. 0.2%) does not matter to them because it is very low in both cases. The decisive factor for them is the higher reward in Lottery B, which is twice as much as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual does not consider this aspect as crucial due to its low value in both cases. Instead, they focus on the magnitude of the reward.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (0.2% chance of 3000 Euros). However, the individual chooses Lottery B because of its higher reward, not because of the probability of the maximum outcome. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as they prioritized the magnitude of the reward over the probability of the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a 0% probability of the maximum outcome of 0 Euros (since its maximum outcome is -3000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 20% probability of the maximum outcome of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the probability of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery B and views it as an opportunity to avoid a loss. They also consider the certain loss in Lottery A and the potential for a higher loss in Lottery B if the 0 Euro outcome is not achieved.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification focuses on the desire to avoid a certain loss (in Lottery A) and the hope for the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B. They prioritize the probability of avoiding a loss over the magnitude of the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considers the probability of avoiding a loss, which aligns with focusing on the probability of the best (maximum) outcome, in this case, 0 Euros in Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a chance, albeit small, of avoiding a loss entirely, which can be seen as prioritizing the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros).

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with the decision reason, as they prioritize the chance of achieving the best possible outcome (0 Euros) over the certainty of a loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, as there are no positive outcomes. The probability of this maximum outcome (0 Euros) for Lottery A is 80% and for Lottery B is 75%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions not focusing strongly on probabilities since they did not seem significantly different, and instead, focused on where the loss was the least. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice based on minimizing loss, stating that the difference in loss probabilities (20% vs. 25%) did not play a role in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcome, which are 80% for A and 75% for B) with that considered by the individual (focused on minimizing loss and not significantly on probabilities). The individual did not consider the probabilities of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) as the basis for their decision but rather the magnitude of the loss and its probability indirectly.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (minimizing loss). The decision reason’s rule is about maximizing the probability of the best outcome (in this case, 0 Euros), but the individual’s justification is about minimizing the loss, not directly about the probabilities of the outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on minimizing loss rather than comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcome (0 Euros) in each lottery.

9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since the other outcome is a loss), and its probability is 55%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros (since the other outcome is a loss as well), and its probability is 10%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is the probability of not losing in each lottery: 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing in each lottery, specifically mentioning that in Lottery B, there's a 90% chance of losing, and in Lottery A, the chances of losing are around 50/50, with the loss in A being higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of losing in Lottery B (90%) was unappealing, despite the loss in A being higher. The individual preferred the roughly equal chances of losing or not in Lottery A over the high likelihood of losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (not losing), which is 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the probability of losing and its magnitude, not directly on the probability of the maximum outcome (not losing).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome (not losing), which would be Lottery A (55% > 10%). The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A but is based on avoiding the high probability of loss in Lottery B rather than directly comparing the probabilities of not losing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome (not losing). While both lead to the choice of Lottery A, the reasoning paths differ. The individual's emphasis on avoiding a high probability of loss rather than seeking the higher probability of not losing indicates that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the choice. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but not entirely, as the outcome aligns coincidentally."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- The probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery A is 0.2%.
- The probability of the maximum outcome in Lottery B is 0.1%.
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, it can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that in both lotteries, the probability of a loss is very low, and the difference of 0.1 in the probabilities does not play a role in their decision. They focused on where they would lose less.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification is based on minimizing the loss, given that the probabilities of loss are very low and the difference in probabilities is insignificant to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason is based on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is about comparing the probabilities of the worst-case scenarios (0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B). However, the individual considered the overall probability of a loss being very low and the difference in probabilities not being significant, without explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case because it has a higher probability (0.2%) of its maximum outcome (-3000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0.1% for -6000 Euros). The individual's justification, however, is about losing less, which aligns with preferring Lottery A because it offers a lesser loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros), but this is not explicitly because of the higher probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the higher probability of the maximum outcome. While the outcome of their decision happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), their justification is based on minimizing loss due to the low probabilities of loss and not directly on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 500 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 1000 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the security of the gain in Lottery A and acknowledges the higher potential gain in Lottery B but notes the lower chance of achieving it.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chooses Lottery A because it offers a secure gain, implying that the certainty of the outcome is a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considers the security (certainty) of the gain in Lottery A and the lower chance of the higher gain in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the security of the gain, which translates to preferring the lottery with a 100% chance of its maximum outcome over one with a 50% chance of its maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's consideration of the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and the acknowledgment of the lower chance of the higher gain in Lottery B directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because of its secure gain mirrors the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 0 Euros (maximum outcome in this context, as it's the best possible result).
- Lottery B: 100% chance of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions not wanting to decide on a sure loss and considers the chance of keeping a certain amount (though the amount is incorrectly stated as 2000 Euro, which is not present in the decision problem). The focus is on avoiding a certain loss and taking a risk for a potentially better outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it offers a chance to avoid loss, implying a preference for the potential of no loss over the certainty of a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which in the case of Lottery A is a 50% chance of 0 Euros and for Lottery B is a 100% chance of -500 Euros. The individual, however, seems to focus on avoiding a sure loss and the potential for a better outcome, without explicitly discussing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. Since Lottery A offers a 50% chance of its maximum outcome (0 Euros), and Lottery B offers a 100% chance of its maximum outcome (-500 Euros), according to the decision reason, Lottery B would actually be preferred if the reason was applied strictly as described, because 100% (for -500 Euros) is indeed a higher probability than 50% (for 0 Euros). However, the individual's justification does not align with this logic; instead, it focuses on avoiding a sure loss, which suggests a different reasoning process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome or its preference rule. The report indicates the individual was motivated by avoiding a sure loss and the potential for a better outcome, rather than comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery B: 25% chance of 6000 Euros
- Lottery A: 25% chance of 4000 Euros
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probability of a win in both lotteries and noted that Lottery A has a higher probability of a win compared to Lottery B, despite the higher potential win in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by stating that they based their decision mainly on the probability of a win, noting that Lottery A has twice the probability of a win as Lottery B, and since the third option (0 Euros) does not pose a loss risk, they chose Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 25% for both lotteries for their respective maximum outcomes. However, the individual discusses the overall probability of a win, not specifically the probability of the maximum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual, however, based their decision on the overall probability of winning any amount, not specifically the maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined, since they considered the overall probability of winning rather than the specific probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's reasoning does involve considering probabilities, which is a key aspect of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while the individual considered probabilities in their decision-making process, they did not specifically apply the decision reason as defined, which focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's focus was broader, on the overall probability of winning, which aligns partially but not entirely with the decision reason."

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a loss in each lottery. Specifically, they noted a 25% probability of losing money in Lottery A and a 50% probability in Lottery B. They also mentioned considering the amounts but decided to focus on the lowest risk based on the probability of a loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the risk of a loss, as indicated by the probability of losing money. They chose the option with the lower probability of losing, which is Lottery A with a 25% chance of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), but the individual focused on the probability of a loss, not specifically the probability of the maximum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual preferred the lottery with the lower probability of a loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but for a different reason than the decision reason specifies.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason as specified. The individual's focus was on minimizing the risk of any loss rather than maximizing the probability of the best outcome (in this case, 0 Euros, which is the maximum outcome in terms of not losing but is not what the individual focused on).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 5 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possible gain in Lottery B as crucial for their decision and compares it to the guaranteed but low amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers taking the risk of not getting any gain in order to have a small chance at a high gain, rather than receiving a low amount of 5 Euros. This indicates the individual values the potential high outcome over the certainty of a low outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The individual focuses on the high potential gain in Lottery B and the certainty of the low gain in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for the high potential gain despite its low probability over the certain but low gain. This suggests the individual is more influenced by the potential amount rather than the probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus is on the potential high gain and the willingness to take a risk for it, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests. The verbal report indicates the individual's decision is driven by a different consideration, prioritizing the potential high reward over the certainty of a low reward, rather than the probability of achieving the maximum outcome. This leads to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B: -5 Euros with 100% probability
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the low probability of a high loss in Lottery A and the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B. They also mention the best-case scenario in Lottery A, which is 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by preferring the certain loss of 5 Euros over the small risk of a high loss in Lottery A, indicating they value avoiding the high loss more than the potential for no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considers the probability of outcomes but focuses on the risk of a high loss rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (0 Euros for A and -5 Euros for B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding risk rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the best outcomes. The individual's focus is on the risk associated with the worst outcome in Lottery A rather than the probability of achieving the best outcome in each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Instead, the individual's focus is on risk avoidance, which suggests that while they consider probabilities, their decision-making process is driven by a different consideration than the one specified by the decision reason. This indicates that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 1500 Euros
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the possible loss in Lottery A, the high risk of the 50/50 chance between a high gain and a high loss, and the guaranteed gain in Lottery B with no risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by focusing on the risk of loss in Lottery A, finding the 50/50 chance too risky, and preferring the guaranteed gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's consideration is more about the risk of loss and the guarantee of gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification is centered around avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, not directly on comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A offers a 100% chance of its maximum outcome (2000 Euros), and Lottery B offers a 50% chance of its maximum outcome (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss in Lottery B, the guaranteed win in Lottery A, and the potential outcomes of both lotteries. They focused on the aspect of risk (50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B) and the certainty of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure win, and they wanted to avoid the risk of losing 3000 Euros associated with Lottery B. They prioritized not losing over the potential for a higher gain, indicating a risk-averse approach.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. While the individual did consider the outcomes, their primary focus was on avoiding loss rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes in each lottery.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process seems to be more aligned with risk aversion and ensuring a certain gain rather than directly applying the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome. However, the individual's choice does align with the decision reason's outcome (preferring Lottery A), but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A due to its certain outcome), the verbal report does not clearly show that the decision was made based on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason dictates. The individual's focus on risk aversion and ensuring a gain suggests a different primary consideration."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which can be derived from the given probabilities and outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, I evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with each lottery, emphasizing the importance of a low risk in their decision-making process. They compared the potential loss and gain in Lottery A and concluded that the risk of losing 3000 Euros was not worth the chance to win the same amount. They also considered the certainty and the smaller but guaranteed gain in Lottery B.

Second, I evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the desire for a secure gain and the avoidance of risk, specifically the risk of losing a significant amount of money. They preferred Lottery B because it offered a guaranteed win without any risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (risk, security, potential loss, and gain), it appears that the individual did not directly focus on the probability of the maximum outcome as the primary factor in their decision. Instead, their focus was on the risk and the certainty of the outcomes.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the secure gain and avoiding risk), it is clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason. The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a guaranteed gain, not because it had a higher probability of its maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 6000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B and finds it too high compared to the potential 50% gain. They value the absence of risk in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it offers security and no possible loss, implying that the risk associated with Lottery B is not worth the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual focuses on avoiding loss and valuing security.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on risk aversion and the desire for security, not explicitly on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process is more aligned with risk aversion and a desire for security rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as specified by the decision reason.
