STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% for one outcome, so the difference is 100% - 100% = 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery, which is 65% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries, then the probabilities (wkts), and then chose based on the expected payout, but also considered the security of the payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure payout, implying that the security ( certainty of getting 2400 Euros) was more important than the potential for a slightly higher payout in Lottery B, especially considering the 1% chance of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered probabilities but focused more on the security and expected payout rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger difference between minimum and maximum probabilities (65% vs. 0%). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the security of the payout and the comparison of expected values, not the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the security and expected value of the payouts rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 33% - 0% = 33%, and for Lottery B, it's 34% - 0% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case would be Lottery B because 34% > 33%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums/outcomes), ""die wkts"" (which could be interpreted as probabilities or weights), and then choosing the lottery with the ""höhere erwartete auszahlung"" (higher expected payout). This suggests the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate the expected value of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout, which implies a calculation involving both the outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities for calculating expected payouts. These are different focuses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, whereas the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout. These are different rules for making a decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The decision reason provided and the individual's justification for their choice do not align. The individual's focus on expected payout, calculated from outcomes and probabilities, does not match the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are 0% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their expected values (mentioned as ""erwartete auszahlung""), indicating a focus on the potential monetary gains and their probabilities (""wkts"" likely refers to weights or probabilities).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout and values a certain gain over a chance at a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, while the individual considered expected values and the certainty of gain. There's no direct mention of comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on expected value and preference for certainty, not the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described, focuses on expected value and the preference for a certain gain over a potential higher but uncertain gain, without mentioning the consideration of the probability ranges. This does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 80% probability implies the rest, 20%, is the probability of the other outcome) and the maximum probability is 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 75% probability implies the rest, 25%, is the probability of the other outcome) and the maximum probability is 25%. Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 20% - 0% = 20%, and for Lottery B is 25% - 0% = 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the ""wkts"" (which could be interpreted as probabilities or weights, but in the context of lotteries, likely refers to probabilities or expected values), and then chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the expected payout (erwartete Auszahlung) of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considers the expected payout, which involves both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout. The individual's justification does not directly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 55% probability, implying the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability) and the maximum probability is 45% (for 6000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 10% probability) and the maximum probability is 90% (for 3000 Euros). The difference for Lottery A is 45% - 0% = 45%, and for Lottery B is 90% - 0% = 90%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities, abbreviated as ""wkts"") of the lotteries. They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout (erwartete Auszahlung) of each lottery, preferring the one with the higher expected value. They also mention considering a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win), even if not as high, which might imply a consideration of risk or certainty but is not directly related to the difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, considered the expected payouts and the probabilities to calculate these expected values, not directly the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (90% difference vs. 45% difference). The individual's justification is based on the expected payout, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on expected payouts and does not indicate a consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for their choice.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, implying 0.2% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.2%. The difference is 0.2%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, implying 0.1% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.1%. The difference is 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout if the chances are small, and they preferred to try for the higher gain if they were lucky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual considered outcomes and probabilities (wkts) without explicitly mentioning the calculation of these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery based on the expected payout and the potential for a higher gain if lucky. These do not align directly with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery A, since the probability is 100% for one outcome, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the ""wkts"" (which can be interpreted as weights or probabilities), and then they consider the expected payout (erwartungswert).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the lottery having the higher expected payout, stating ""erwartungswert links besser,"" which translates to ""expected value left is better."" This implies the individual is making their decision based on which lottery has the higher expected value, not directly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, whereas the individual considers the expected payouts and outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, while the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout. These are fundamentally different criteria for making a decision.

Based on these comparisons, it's clear that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision. Instead, they based their decision on the expected value of the lotteries.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's a 75% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 25% (for -3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's an 80% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros). The relevant information for Lottery A is a difference of 25% (25% - 0%), and for Lottery B, it's a difference of 20% (20% - 0%). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered outcomes and probabilities but aimed to maximize the expected payout.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout. These are fundamentally different criteria.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason's focus on probability differences does not align with the individual's focus on expected payouts.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, implying the remaining 0.2% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (for -3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, implying the remaining 0.1% is the maximum) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for -6000 Euros). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 0.2% - 0% = 0.2%, and for Lottery B is 0.1% - 0% = 0.1%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts, likely short for ""Wahrscheinlichkeiten,"" German for probabilities) of the lotteries. Then, they considered the expected payout (erwartete Auszahlung) and the potential loss (Verlust).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery based on the higher expected payout, considering the potential loss should not be too high. This implies a focus on maximizing expected value while minimizing potential downside risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, expected payout, and potential loss): The individual considered probabilities but in the context of expected payouts and potential losses, not specifically the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher expected payout with manageable loss): The individual's justification does not directly relate to comparing the differences in probability ranges between the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's focus was more on expected value and managing potential losses, which does not align with the decision reason provided.

First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and their expected payouts, as well as the risk associated with each lottery, specifically mentioning the risk of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher expected payout but also considered the risk, acknowledging that while the expected payouts might be the same, the potential loss of -5000 Euros in Lottery A is significantly worse than the loss of -5 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of expected payouts and risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on expected payout and risk, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on expected payouts and the risk associated with each lottery, rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it has a 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Thus, both lotteries have the same difference between their minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (erwartete Auszahlung).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but not in the context of comparing the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would lead to indifference. However, the individual's justification was based on the expected payout, not on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision was based on expected payout, not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the decision reason, we need to understand that it looks for the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. In this context, since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between them based on this criterion alone. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities, referred to as ""wkts"") of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung""). This implies the individual calculated or considered the expected value of each lottery by multiplying the outcomes by their probabilities and summing these products.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate expected payouts. The individual's focus was on expected value, not on the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but the individual preferred the lottery based on its expected payout. The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not align.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their expected payouts, focusing on the concept of ""erwartete Auszahlung"" which translates to expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers a certain gain over a chance of loss, indicating a preference for the lottery with a guaranteed positive outcome, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its certain payout of 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected payouts and the certainty of gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not apply directly. The individual's justification, however, is based on the preference for a certain gain, not on the probabilities' differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the individual's decision was based on the expected payout and the preference for a certain gain over a chance of loss, suggesting that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries. They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the lottery that offered a higher expected payout or, if equal, chose the one that avoided the chance of loss (""besser nichts als Chance auf Verlust"" translates to ""better nothing than the chance of loss"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on expected payouts and avoiding loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which does not align with the individual’s justification of choosing based on expected payout or avoiding loss.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision.
