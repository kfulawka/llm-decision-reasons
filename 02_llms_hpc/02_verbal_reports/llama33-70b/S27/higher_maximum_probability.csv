STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 66% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially looked at the information of Lottery B, then focused on Lottery A, and compared the values of both lotteries. They noted that with Lottery A, there's a high probability (close to 100%) of winning, with a potential increase of 100 Euros compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparison of potential winnings and the high probability of winning with Lottery A, mentioning the possibility of winning more than with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 66% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. The individual considered the high probability of winning with Lottery A but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum probability but rather on the potential for a higher win with a high probability.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the maximum probability of the outcomes. The individual's focus was more on the potential for a higher win with a high probability rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a 33% probability of winning 2500 Euros and a 67% probability of winning 0 Euros. Lottery B has a 34% probability of winning 2400 Euros and a 66% probability of winning 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of winning (33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sums of the two lotteries and the probabilities of receiving money. They mention that the difference in sums is small, implying they looked at the monetary outcomes, and they preferred a slightly greater probability of receiving money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on comparing the importance of receiving money versus the amount of money. They decided in favor of receiving money, indicating that the probability of getting some amount of money was more important to them than the potential amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of winning, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probability of receiving money. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of winning, which is Lottery B with a 34% chance. The individual's justification emphasizes the preference for a higher probability of receiving money, which also points towards preferring Lottery B because it has a slightly higher probability of winning.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they both prioritize the probability of winning over the amount won when the difference in amounts is considered small.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for the outcome of 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these maximum probabilities: 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery A (80%) and compared it to the certainty of winning in Lottery B. They also thought about their personal threshold for risk, mentioning that around 70% probability, they would have likely chosen the safer option B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability (80%) of winning was very appealing, suggesting that the perceived high probability played a significant role in their decision. They also mentioned that with Lottery A, they couldn’t lose, implying an attraction to the potential gain without considering the loss aspect directly in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning in Lottery A and the certainty of Lottery B), it appears the individual did consider the probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing Lottery A due to its high probability), there seems to be a discrepancy. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery B due to its 100% probability, but the individual chose Lottery A, emphasizing the high probability of winning. However, the individual's reasoning about probabilities and their impact on the decision suggests they were influenced by the concept of probability, even if their final choice does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of probabilities and their impact on the decision suggests some alignment with the decision reason's focus on probabilities. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's choice and justification, while influenced by probability considerations, do not directly follow the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score. The score of 20 indicates that while there is some relevance of the decision reason in the individual's thought process, the primary driver of their decision does not strictly adhere to the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities. Since both lotteries have their highest probabilities associated with the 0 Euro outcome, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher maximum probability (80% vs 75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of receiving money and evaluated it as high. They also thought about the possibility of receiving a smaller amount of money and considered this possibility to be of high value.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of receiving money, implying that the possibility of getting any positive amount was more valuable to them than the actual sum they might receive.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case is the probability of receiving 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual's focus was on the probability of receiving any money, not specifically the probability of the maximum outcome (which is 0 Euros for both).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is about preferring the higher probability of receiving any money, not necessarily the outcome with the highest probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align more with considering the probability of a positive outcome rather than the specific rule of the decision reason, which focuses on the maximum probability regardless of the outcome's value. However, there is a slight alignment in the preference for higher probabilities, but it's applied differently (to the chance of getting any money rather than the specific outcome with the highest probability).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification and consideration focus on the probability of receiving any money, not the maximum probability as defined by the decision reason."
5,"die Gesamtsituation meiner Wahlergebnisse sehr anders wäre wenn ich nicht an dieser Studie mit dem Bewusstswein teilnehmen würde, finanziell abgesichert zu sein.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for the outcome of 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). Since the reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, it can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between the 90% probability of Lottery A and the 55% probability of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sums of the two lotteries and the potential to double the sum. They also thought about the relatively low probability of receiving the higher sum and the absence of risk in losing money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the potential for a higher sum and the absence of risk in losing money, but also mentioned that the low probability of achieving this sum was a factor. They seem to prioritize the potential gain and the security of not losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key factor. The individual discusses probabilities but in the context of achieving a certain sum, not the maximum probability of any outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 90% probability. The individual's justification, however, seems to be more about the potential gain and the security of not losing, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual used the decision reason that considers the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was more on the potential outcomes and the security aspect rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros) and the probability for the positive outcome is 0.2%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros) and the probability for the positive outcome is 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of receiving any money in both lotteries and seemed to focus on the idea of making a positive gain despite believing it's highly unlikely.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to revolve around the idea of choosing an option that offers any chance of a positive outcome, despite acknowledging the decision feels somewhat irrelevant due to the extremely low probabilities of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in both cases is the probability of winning 0 Euros. However, the individual's focus, as described, seems more on the existence of any positive outcome rather than comparing the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (0 Euros in both cases).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher maximum probability (99.9% vs 99.8% for the outcome of 0 Euros), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these probabilities or using them as a basis for the decision. Instead, the individual talks about the desire to choose an option that offers any chance of a positive gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus of the individual seems to be more on the presence of a positive outcome rather than the probabilities of the most likely outcomes, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (associated with a loss of 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (associated with a loss of 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: the maximum probabilities of Lotteries A and B are 80% and 100%, respectively.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the comparison of the values (outcomes) and the probabilities, specifically mentioning the 20% probability and the difference in potential losses between Lotteries A and B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that a 20% probability was not enough to risk an additional 1000 Euros in loss, implying that the potential loss and its associated probability were key factors in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 80% for A and 100% for B. The individual, however, discussed the 20% probability of avoiding a loss in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the maximum probability as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the risk of additional loss associated with a specific probability, not directly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. Instead, their decision was influenced by the potential loss and the specific probability of avoiding that loss, rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). 
The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 80% for Lottery B and 75% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries and the potential losses. 
They mention that when the sums (potential losses) do not differ strongly, their focus shifts to the probabilities, and small differences in probabilities can be decisive in their choice. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B despite the possibility of losing 1000 Euros more, indicating that a difference of 5 percentage points in probabilities (if they remember correctly) outweighs the potential additional loss of 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which are 80% for Lottery B and 75% for Lottery A. 
The individual considered probabilities but focused on the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries rather than explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities. 
However, their discussion implies an awareness of the probabilities, which is relevant to the decision reason. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with an 80% probability of winning 0 Euros. 
The individual chose Lottery B, citing the importance of probability differences, which aligns with the principle of preferring a higher probability, even though they did not explicitly state they chose based on the maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment suggests that while the individual's decision process and justification share some elements with the decision reason (such as considering probabilities and preferring the option with the more favorable probability aspect), they did not explicitly apply the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher maximum probability as stated in the decision reason. The individual's focus was more on the comparative differences in probabilities and their impact on the decision rather than the absolute maximum probabilities of the outcomes. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty due to the lack of explicit alignment with the decision reason's rule."
9,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes for each lottery. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries, the magnitude of the potential losses (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros), and their personal aversion to losing large sums of money. They also mentioned that an increase in the difference between the potential losses (by 1000 Euros) could have changed their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the perceived risk of losing money, especially the high probability of losing a significant amount (3000 Euros) in Lottery B, and the relative comparison of the loss amounts between the two lotteries. They express a reluctance to lose large sums of money, which influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered a broader range of factors including the magnitude of potential losses, personal financial risk aversion, and comparative loss amounts.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 90% probability of losing 3000 Euros. However, the individual's justification does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries but rather focuses on the perceived risk and magnitude of losses.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. Their deliberation process involved more nuanced considerations than just the maximum probability of each lottery.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, the maximum probability for Lottery A is 99.9% (0 Euros) and for Lottery B is 99.8% (0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in probabilities (0.1 percentage points) and deemed it insignificant. They looked at the values and focused on the high probability (99.x%) of receiving 0 Euros, which led them to disregard the possibility of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the lesser loss, based on the mindset that they would not have to experience the loss anyway.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B), but the individual's consideration of probabilities seems to be more about the perceived insignificance of small probability differences rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on choosing the lesser loss and the mindset of not experiencing the loss, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the higher maximum probability. The individual's focus was on the perceived insignificance of small probability differences and choosing the lesser loss, rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the risk associated with the lotteries and the potential gain of 500 Euros more. The individual mentions that it's not worth the risk to potentially lose 500 Euros for a gain of only 500 Euros more, indicating a focus on the certainty of the outcome. The justification for the choice seems to be based on the desire for a guaranteed outcome (500 Euros) over a riskier option (Lottery A), which might imply a consideration of the probability of the outcomes, but it's not explicitly stated in terms of comparing the maximum probabilities.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B) with that considered by the individual (risk, potential gain, and the certainty of the outcome), there's an indirect alignment. The individual's focus on the certainty of the 500 Euros outcome (which corresponds to the 100% probability of Lottery B) suggests they valued the higher probability of a positive outcome, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability. However, the individual's justification doesn't explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) seems to align with the individual's implicit preference for the guaranteed outcome (Lottery B), but the verbal report doesn't directly state this comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects a leaning towards the use of the decision reason due to the individual's preference for the guaranteed outcome (which aligns with the higher maximum probability), but it's not a certain conclusion because the verbal report doesn't explicitly discuss comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 50% for Lottery A versus 100% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes (mentioning a ""Wahrscheinlichkeit von 1/2"" which translates to a probability of 1/2 or 50%), the difference in the sums of the losses, and the potential impact of each loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by considering the realistic chance of not losing money with a 50% probability, the relatively small difference in the sums of the losses, and the comparative impact of losing 500 Euros versus 1000 Euros, weighing the possibility of not losing money against the potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. The individual discusses probabilities but does not explicitly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries in the context of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 100% probability. However, the individual's justification does not directly mention preferring a lottery based on the highest maximum probability but instead focuses on the implications of the probabilities and the amounts of potential loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The report discusses probabilities and potential losses but does not explicitly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the basis for the decision, nor does it apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the overall probability of winning any amount of money and compared it between the two lotteries. They also thought about the value of winning any amount of money versus winning nothing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because the overall probability of winning any amount of money was 25% higher than in Lottery A. They valued winning any amount of money over winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the overall probability of winning any amount of money. These are not the same, as the maximum probability in the decision reason refers to the highest probability of any single outcome, not the cumulative probability of winning any amount. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on the overall probability of winning any amount of money, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as defined to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the overall probability of winning any amount, not the maximum probability of a single outcome as specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 75% probability of winning 0 Euros. The relevant information for this decision reason is the probabilities associated with each outcome of the lotteries.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the potential losses of each lottery, noting that with Lottery B, there was a high chance of losing either 4000E or 2000E, whereas with Lottery A, there was a 75% chance (misstated as 72% in the report) of not losing any money. The individual's justification for their choice seems to weigh the probabilities and amounts of potential losses against each other, suggesting that the high probability of not losing money with Lottery A was a significant factor.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing money and the chance of not losing any money), there's a partial alignment. The individual did consider probabilities, but specifically focused on the aspect of not losing money, which aligns with the concept of the maximum probability (in this case, the probability of the 0 Euro outcome). However, the decision reason's rule prefers the lottery based solely on the maximum probability, without considering the amounts of potential losses as the individual did. The individual's justification for the choice seems to incorporate a more nuanced evaluation than the decision reason's straightforward comparison of maximum probabilities. Given this, while the individual's thought process shares some elements with the decision reason (consideration of probabilities), it introduces additional considerations (the amounts of potential losses) not accounted for by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities, which is a key component of the decision reason, their deliberation process included additional factors (like the amounts of potential losses) not directly addressed by the decision reason. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the sole or primary basis for the individual's decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 5 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 99.9% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A and compared it with the guaranteed win in Lottery B. They focused on the comparison of probabilities and also thought about how their decision would change if the probability of winning in Lottery A were higher but the value lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by stating that the probability of winning in Lottery A was too low, making a small guaranteed win more valuable to them than the possibility of no win. They also mentioned that their focus was strongly on comparing probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. While the individual did consider probabilities, their focus was more on the probability of winning a positive amount rather than the maximum probability across all outcomes. However, it's clear they were aware of the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery B with 100% probability of winning 5 Euros. The individual chose Lottery B but justified it based on the low probability of the significant win in Lottery A and the value of a guaranteed win, rather than explicitly stating a preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision process and justification share some elements with the decision reason, such as considering probabilities and choosing the lottery with a higher probability of a positive outcome. However, the explicit focus of the decision reason on the maximum probability across all outcomes (including the 99.9% chance of winning 0 Euros in Lottery A) does not perfectly align with the individual's stated focus on the probability of winning a positive amount and the value of a guaranteed win. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's not a perfect match, leading to an assessment that is above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the -5 Euros outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially considered their intuition (Bauchgefühl) for choosing Lottery A but then revised their opinion after thinking more about it. They mention the low probability of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B and seem to downplay its significance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the perceived low risk of the significant loss in Lottery B, but they also express a contradictory inclination towards choosing Lottery A in a different situation. The deliberation process indicates a consideration of probabilities but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the low probability of a significant loss but does not directly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is more focused on the perceived risk of the significant loss in Lottery B rather than a direct comparison of the maximum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems that while the individual considered probabilities, there is no clear indication that they applied the specific rule of comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as stated in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as there is no explicit mention of comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries in the verbal report, and the individual's justification does not clearly align with the decision reason's rule."
17,"ientlich von Anfang an bewusst. Ich habe mich dahher für Option B entschieden. Der Erhalt EINER Summe steht hier im Vordergrund, nicht der Erhalr WELCHER Summe. Natürlich nur wenn die Differenzen der beiden Summen nicht immenz unterscghiedlich ist.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 50% (Lottery A) vs. 100% (Lottery B).

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the risk of losing money as a significant factor (""Wenn es die Möglichkeit gibt Geld zu verlieren, bin ich nicht wirklich bereit dieses Risiko einzugehen""). The individual was aware of this risk from the start when considering Lottery A. The justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A is the preference for avoiding the risk of losing money and the emphasis on receiving a sum of money (""Der Erhalt EINER Summe steht hier im Vordergrund, nicht der Erhalt WELCHER Summe""), as long as the difference between the sums is not immensely different.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing money, preference for receiving any sum over the risk of losing), it appears the individual's focus was more on the risk aspect and the certainty of receiving a sum rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the decision reason's preference for the higher maximum probability (which aligns with avoiding risk by choosing the certain outcome) indirectly aligns with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B, as the certain outcome (100% probability of gaining 1500 Euros) is preferred over the risky outcome. The individual's reasoning does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities but does imply a preference for certainty over risk, which is in line with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates a leaning towards the decision reason being used, as the individual's preference for certainty and avoidance of risk indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher maximum probability. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly discuss probabilities but rather the implications of those probabilities (risk and certainty)."
18,"das Risikon wert wäre, euinen so gr0ßen Verlust zu machen um nur 1000 Euro mehr zu erhalten. Ich habe mich dagegen entschieden. Die Differenz7 zwischen den Gewinnen von A und B häte hierfür sehr viel größer sein müssen.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: the probabilities of the outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first considered both options and thought about them briefly. They initially chose Lottery A, then reconsidered the information and weighed the risk of making a significant loss to gain only 1000 Euros more. They decided against taking this risk, reasoning that the difference between the gains of A and B would have had to be much greater. The information considered by the individual includes the potential gains and losses of both lotteries and the risk associated with Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the risk assessment and the comparison of potential gains.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential gains, losses, and risk), it appears the individual focused more on the potential outcomes and the risk rather than the probabilities themselves. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability of gaining 2000 Euros. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the risk of significant loss and the comparative gain, not explicitly on the maximum probability of the outcomes. 

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes. The verbal report indicates a decision process focused on risk assessment and comparative gains rather than the probabilities of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the sum of the monetary outcomes of Lottery B, which resulted in 0, and the difference between the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery A and the potential loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was the large difference between the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros and the potential loss of 3000 Euros, which seemed too great. The individual also mentioned an initial intuitive step of summing the outcomes of Lottery B, which contributed to the decision to choose A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's considerations as described in the verbal report do not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the lotteries. Instead, the individual focused on the outcomes and their intuition about the risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its 100% probability of winning. However, the individual's justification does not mention the probability of winning as a factor in the decision. The justification revolves around the perceived risk and the difference in potential outcomes, not the probabilities associated with those outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes. The report focuses on the intuition about the sum of outcomes and the risk associated with potential losses, without mentioning the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning 6000 Euros and losing 6000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 100% probability of winning 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 50% probability of winning 6000 Euros and a 50% probability of losing 6000 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the potential loss and gain from Lottery B, indicating an awareness of the 6000 Euros loss and gain but does not explicitly mention probabilities. They seem to focus on the risk of losing a significant amount of money and the value they place on avoiding this loss versus the potential gain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential loss of 6000 Euros is not worth the potential gain of 6000 Euros, indicating a risk-averse attitude. They express a preference for maintaining their current financial state rather than risking a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is explicitly 100% for Lottery A and 50% for the best outcome of Lottery B. However, the individual's verbal report does not mention probabilities or the concept of maximum probability in their deliberation.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability of winning 0 Euros. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived value of potential gains and losses and their risk aversion, not on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum probabilities. Instead, the individual's focus is on the risk and potential outcomes, indicating that the decision reason might not have been the basis for their choice.
