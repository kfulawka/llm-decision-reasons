STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there are probabilities of 33%, 66%, and 1% for different outcomes, indicating no sure outcome (100% probability for a single outcome). In Lottery B, there is a 100% chance of winning 2400 Euros, which is a sure outcome. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a ""Verlustchance von 1%,"" which translates to a ""1% chance of loss,"" indicating consideration of the low probability of not winning anything in Lottery A. They also mention a ""Chance von 33%,"" which they consider significant, showing they have considered the probabilities of the different outcomes in Lottery A. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the nearly negligible risk (1% chance of losing) was worth taking to increase their probable gain. This indicates the individual weighed the potential benefits against the very small risk of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence or absence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual, we see the individual focused on the probabilities and potential gains rather than explicitly discussing the presence or absence of a sure outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification (taking a small risk for a higher potential gain), it appears the individual's reasoning is more aligned with risk-taking for potential higher rewards rather than explicitly avoiding a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate they preferred Lottery A because it lacks a sure outcome, as the decision reason would suggest. Instead, the report focuses on the consideration of probabilities and the potential for higher gain despite a small risk. This suggests that while the individual did choose Lottery A, the reasoning provided does not align closely with the decision reason's emphasis on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, both lotteries (A and B) have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with certain probabilities (66% for Lottery A and 67% for Lottery B), but neither has a guaranteed positive outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure positive outcome in each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Since both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome, the decision reason's preference would be based on the absence of a sure positive outcome in both, but it specifically looks for the lottery without a sure outcome, which in its traditional sense (a guaranteed win or loss) does not apply directly here as both have a chance of winning and losing. However, since both lotteries do not offer a sure positive outcome but rather a mix of a potential win and a sure loss (0 Euros), the decision reason's applicability is somewhat nuanced. It does not directly apply because both lotteries have an element of risk (chance of winning and losing), but it could be interpreted in the context of risk mitigation as described by the individual.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries, the similarity in the monetary values of the potential wins, and the trade-off between a slightly higher chance of winning and a slightly lower potential win amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the risk of losing against the potential gain, deciding that mitigating the risk of losing (by choosing the lottery with a slightly higher chance of winning, even if the potential win is lower) was more valuable than the potential of winning a higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities of winning and the potential amounts, considering the risk of losing and the value of slightly increased chances of winning. The individual did not explicitly mention the presence or absence of a sure outcome as a deciding factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which does not directly apply since both lotteries have outcomes that include a chance of winning and a sure loss (0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, was about mitigating risk and valuing a higher chance of winning over a higher potential win, which does not align with the decision reason's rule about sure outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. The individual's focus was on risk mitigation and the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount to be won, rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is a sure outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability. In Lottery B, there is no sure outcome as it offers 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and it would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and compared it with the sure outcome of Lottery A. They also mention considering the decision in isolation and applying an initial impulse to choose the opposite of their previous choice, but then focusing on the risk associated with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk of losing 3000 Euros, although small (20%), was not negligible, leading them to choose the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), which is Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's consideration was more about the risk associated with Lottery B and the safety of Lottery A, rather than the absence or presence of a sure outcome as a deciding factor.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome (Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A because it was the safe option, directly opposite to what the decision reason would suggest.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification and consideration were based on risk aversion rather than the preference for a lottery without a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, A and B, neither has a sure outcome of a non-zero amount; both have a chance of winning a specific amount and a chance of winning 0 Euros, which can be considered as not having a sure, positive outcome in the traditional sense. However, the essence of the decision reason seems to focus on the absence of a guaranteed, non-zero payout. Since both lotteries do not offer a guaranteed, non-zero payout, the information relevant to this reason can be derived from understanding that neither lottery guarantees a win. Thus, the decision reason can technically be applied by considering which lottery's structure (in terms of probabilities and payouts) might align with preferring ""no sure outcome"" in a broader sense, but it seems more about the preference for higher potential returns without a guaranteed win.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison with another lottery scenario (2400€-34% vs. 2500€-33%), indicating they considered the probabilities and payouts in their decision-making process. They also mention the importance of significantly increasing their chances of success over maximizing potential gain in scenarios where the outcome is unlikely but realistically possible.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that in scenarios with low probabilities of winning, they prefer to increase their chances of winning significantly rather than aiming for the highest potential payout. This suggests they value probability over payout amount in certain conditions.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the absence of a sure outcome, which doesn't directly align with the individual's consideration of probabilities and payouts in a comparative manner. The individual's focus seems more on the balance between probability and payout rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since neither lottery offers a sure, non-zero outcome, this reason doesn't directly apply in a straightforward manner. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes increasing the chances of success, which doesn't directly relate to preferring a lottery because it lacks a sure outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome of a non-zero amount for all probabilities, but Lottery B offers a higher probability (90%) of a non-zero outcome, which might be perceived as closer to a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the presence of sure outcomes and their probabilities. Here, Lottery A has a 45% chance of a non-zero outcome, and Lottery B has a 90% chance of a non-zero outcome. Neither lottery has a ""sure"" outcome in the traditional sense (100% probability), but the reason's applicability hinges on the concept of a ""sure outcome"" being interpreted in the context of high-probability outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as ""beinahe garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) and the significant value of the potential win (3000 Euros). They also considered the lower probability (45%) of winning in Lottery A as a risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because its high probability of winning made it seem like a ""sichere Route"" (safe route) for achieving a win, as opposed to the riskier option of Lottery A with its lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but since neither lottery offers a traditional sure outcome, the comparison involves how the individual perceives and weighs the probabilities. The individual's consideration of the high probability in Lottery B as ""almost guaranteed"" suggests they were drawn to what could be interpreted as the closest to a sure outcome between the two options.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was because its outcome felt more guaranteed, which aligns with preferring a lottery that has a characteristic (high probability) that might be misconstrued as a sure outcome, but actually, it goes against the decision reason's rule since the individual is essentially seeking the option that feels more secure or sure.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a sure outcome. Instead, the individual preferred the lottery that felt more secure or guaranteed, which directly opposes the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. However, both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with high probabilities (99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B), which means the decision reason's primary criterion (presence of a sure outcome) is applicable but does not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome since both have one. The relevant information for this reason is that both lotteries offer a sure outcome of 0 Euros, but with different probabilities of winning a non-zero amount.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and deemed them ""praktisch vernachlässigbar"" (practically negligible). They also considered the potential winnings (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros) and their ability to overcome the low probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the height of the prize money in case of a win, given that they believed overcoming the low probability of winning would be similarly challenging in both cases.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's deliberation focused more on the similarity in the low probabilities of winning and the potential winnings, not directly on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a sure outcome, this rule does not directly apply. The individual's justification, however, was based on the potential winnings, not on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the potential winnings and the perceived equivalence in overcoming low probabilities, rather than on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, Lottery A has an 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros and a 20% chance of 0 Euros, while Lottery B has a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, specifically the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery B has a sure outcome, while Lottery A does not have a sure outcome but has a chance of no loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses of both lotteries, focusing on minimizing the ""realistisch wahrscheinlichen Verlust"" (realistically probable loss). They noted the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A but deemed this probability too low to justify the additional potential loss compared to Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the expected or probable loss, considering both the probability of no loss in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B. They chose based on the perceived value of avoiding a larger potential loss, even if that meant accepting a certain, but lesser, loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention preferring the lottery without a sure outcome as their primary reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. However, the individual's justification is centered around minimizing the probable loss, not explicitly on avoiding a sure outcome. In fact, they chose the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B) because it represented a lesser loss compared to the potential loss in Lottery A.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery without a sure outcome solely based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with certain probabilities (80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 0 Euro outcome with 80% probability.
- Lottery B has a 0 Euro outcome with 75% probability.
This information indicates both lotteries do have a sure outcome (0 Euros), but with different probabilities. The decision reason, as stated, would not directly apply since both lotteries have a sure outcome, but we can proceed to understand the individual's thought process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probabilities of the losses and the potential loss amounts. They mention that the probabilities were low, but they were not willing to risk a larger loss to reduce the chance of that loss. They also mention that loss amounts are valued higher than gain amounts, implying a loss aversion.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification is based on their risk aversion towards larger losses and the perceived value of avoiding such losses, rather than directly comparing the sure outcomes or their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's consideration is more about the risk of losses and their valuation of those losses compared to potential gains.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a sure outcome, this reason does not directly apply. The individual's justification is based on minimizing potential losses and their perceived impact, not on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process seems to be driven by loss aversion and the valuation of potential losses rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome in the lotteries. Therefore, the decision reason, as stated, does not align with the individual's justification for their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, both have outcomes of 0 Euros, which can be considered as a form of a ""sure outcome"" in the sense that it's a guaranteed minimum, but more accurately, neither lottery offers a ""sure"" positive outcome. However, the essence of the decision reason seems to focus on the absence of a guaranteed positive outcome or the presence of risk. Both lotteries present risks, but Lottery A has a higher probability of a negative outcome (-3000 Euros) that is less severe than the negative outcome in Lottery B (-6000 Euros). The information relevant to this decision reason includes the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, which are: 
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 45% probability, 0 Euros with 55% probability.
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 90% probability, 0 Euros with 10% probability.
This information is relevant because it highlights the risk and potential losses associated with each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options and the attractive option of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%. They also thought about whether reducing the risk of a higher loss was worth the potential for a greater loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), implying they chose the option that seemed to minimize their risk of a significant loss, specifically aiming to avoid the potential loss of 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the risk of loss and the attractiveness of reducing the probability of a higher loss, which aligns with considering the presence of risk in both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification suggests they chose based on minimizing risk, not necessarily seeking the absence of a sure outcome. The decision reason and the individual's justification do not directly align since the individual preferred what they perceived as the ""safe route,"" which actually goes against the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a sure outcome, as both lotteries have a form of risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on minimizing risk and avoiding the higher potential loss led them to choose the lottery that, in their perception, offered a safer route, which does not align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with high probabilities (99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B). However, the reason's applicability hinges on identifying a lottery without a sure outcome, which is not directly applicable here since both have a sure outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the presence or absence of sure outcomes and their implications. However, given that both lotteries essentially have a sure outcome (0 Euros), the reason as stated does not directly apply in a meaningful way since it cannot differentiate between the two based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the probabilities of the non-zero outcomes (0.1% and 0.2%) and deems them ""ungefähr gleich irrelevant"" (approximately equally irrelevant) for a single trial. This indicates the individual is focusing on the similarity in the low probability of the non-zero outcomes rather than their differences. 
Second, the individual's justification for their choice is to minimize the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in a theoretical case of bad luck. This implies the individual is considering the negative outcomes (losses) of the lotteries and aiming to minimize potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of sure outcomes and their implications) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of non-zero outcomes and minimization of potential loss), it appears the individual is not directly considering the presence or absence of sure outcomes as the decision reason would suggest. Instead, the focus is on the potential losses and their probabilities. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) to the individual's justification (minimizing potential loss), there is a clear discrepancy. The decision reason as stated cannot be directly applied to prefer one lottery over the other based on the absence of a sure outcome since both lotteries have a dominant sure outcome of 0 Euros. The individual's approach, however, focuses on minimizing loss, which aligns with considering the magnitude of potential losses rather than the presence or absence of sure outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the probabilities of losses and the desire to minimize potential loss, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers a lottery based on the absence of a sure outcome. Given that both lotteries have a sure outcome, and the individual's justification does not reflect a consideration of the decision reason as stated, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is no sure outcome since the outcome is uncertain (1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability). In Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: Lottery A has no sure outcome, and Lottery B has a sure outcome of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical value of both options and the impact of the current additional reward on their decision. They mention that both options were mathematically equal in value but were swayed by the desire to ensure an increase in their winnings rather than maximizing the potential for further wins.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the guarantee of increasing their winnings, implying a preference for a sure gain over the potential for a higher but uncertain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The individual, while considering the mathematical equality of the options, was influenced by the desire for a sure increase in their winnings, which indirectly relates to the concept of sure outcomes but does not directly address the decision reason's criteria.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the guarantee of increasing their winnings, which aligns more with preferring a sure outcome, contrary to the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there's a 50% chance of -1000 Euros and a 50% chance of 0 Euros, meaning there's no sure outcome since the outcome is uncertain. For Lottery B, there's a 100% chance of -500 Euros, which is a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""50% sind immernoch eine relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis"" (""50% is still a relevant chance of an outcome""), indicating they considered the probability aspect of Lottery A. They also talk about minimizing the ""absoluten möglichen Verlustwert"" (""absolute possible loss value""), which suggests they considered the potential losses of both lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on minimizing the absolute possible loss value, which implies they preferred the option with the lesser or no guaranteed loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason hinges on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual's consideration seems more focused on the probability of an outcome and minimizing loss. While related, these are not exactly the same focus.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification, as understood from the verbal report, emphasizes minimizing the absolute loss, which aligns more with preferring Lottery B (-500 Euros sure loss) over Lottery A (potential for a -1000 Euros loss). This does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual's reasoning appears to prioritize minimizing potential loss, which leads to a different preference (Lottery B over Lottery A in this context).

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is no sure outcome since all outcomes have probabilities less than 100%. For Lottery B, there is also no sure outcome for the same reason. However, it's worth noting that the decision reason's applicability hinges on identifying a sure outcome, which is typically defined as an outcome with a 100% probability of occurring. Since neither lottery has a sure outcome in this traditional sense, the decision reason's direct application might be nuanced. The relevant information for the decision reason in this context would involve identifying any outcomes that could be misconstrued as ""sure"" due to their probability or the structure of the lotteries, but based on the given probabilities, neither lottery offers a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of money (excluding zero) to be large since they were all four-digit numbers. They focused on which option gave them a higher probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification was based on comparing the probabilities of winning a large amount from each lottery, not directly on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's consideration was about the probability of winning a large amount, not directly about sure outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification was about maximizing the probability of a large win, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on the probability of winning a large amount, not on the presence or absence of a sure outcome as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a sure outcome (0 Euros), and Lottery B has a 75% chance of a sure outcome (0 Euros). However, the decision reason's definition implies it looks for the absence of a sure outcome in the traditional sense (a 100% chance of a specific outcome), which is not directly applicable here since neither lottery offers a 100% chance of any outcome. Nonetheless, we can interpret the reason as preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the sure outcome (0 Euros) if we consider the spirit of avoiding certainty of no gain. The relevant information for the decision reason in this context would be the probabilities of the 0 Euro outcomes in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the significant impact of these losses. They prioritized minimizing the chance of losing, specifically mentioning the difference in the probability of not losing (or winning nothing, in this context) between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the risk of loss, particularly valuing the higher chance of not losing (25 percentage points higher chance of not losing) over reducing the amount of loss in the unlikely event of a bad outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the absence or lower probability of a sure outcome, while the individual focused on minimizing the risk of loss and valued the higher probability of not losing. The individual's consideration indirectly touches upon the concept of sure outcomes (0 Euros) but frames it as minimizing loss rather than avoiding a sure outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome (or with a lower probability of a sure outcome, by interpretation), which would be Lottery B in the context of having a lower chance of winning nothing (75% vs 50% for Lottery A). However, the individual's justification prioritizes the higher chance of not losing, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its 50% chance of 0 Euros being seen as a ""loss avoidance"" strategy, albeit not directly stated as preferring the absence of a sure outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason as defined. The individual prioritizes minimizing the chance of any loss, which leads them to prefer Lottery A due to its structure, not explicitly because it has a sure outcome or lacks one. The decision reason, as interpreted for this scenario, would actually suggest preferring Lottery B if we consider the ""sure outcome"" as the 0 Euro result, due to its higher probability of this outcome, which contradicts the individual's choice based on their stated reasoning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is a 0.1% chance of winning 5000 Euros and a 99.9% chance of winning 0 Euros, which means there is no guaranteed outcome since the 0 Euro outcome is not a ""sure win"" in the context of gaining money, but it does imply a sure outcome of not winning the jackpot. In Lottery B, there is a 100% chance of winning 5 Euros, which is a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a guaranteed monetary gain in each lottery. Lottery A does not offer a guaranteed monetary gain (since the guaranteed outcome is 0 Euros), and Lottery B does offer a guaranteed monetary gain (5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that a 0.1% chance is ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), indicating they considered the probability of the high payout in Lottery A. They also mention preferring a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot, showing they considered the sure outcome of Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for a guaranteed small win (Lottery B) over the small chance of a large win (Lottery A), indicating they value the certainty of a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in terms of gaining money. The individual considered the sure outcome of Lottery B and the low probability of the high payout in Lottery A, but their focus was on the guaranteed gain, not the absence of a sure gain as the decision reason would prioritize.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery A because it does not guarantee any monetary gain. However, the individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed small win, which directly contradicts the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's preference for a guaranteed small win over the chance of a larger win, as expressed in the verbal report, directly contradicts the decision reason that prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is a 99.9% chance of a sure outcome (0 Euros), and for Lottery B, there is a 100% chance of a sure outcome (-5 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: the presence of a sure outcome in both lotteries and the probabilities associated with these outcomes.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process as follows: 
- The individual initially considered the loss in Lottery A to be extremely unattractive, which drew them to Option B.
- Then, they examined the probability distribution in Lottery A and realized that the 0.1% chance of a significant loss is negligible, making the outcome of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.
- The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that, without a realistic risk, Lottery A was the preferred choice.
The information considered by the individual includes the outcomes and their probabilities, particularly focusing on the negligible risk in Lottery A. The individual's justification emphasizes the practical guarantee of not losing in Lottery A due to the low probability of the loss outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome and its probability) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and the concept of negligible risk), it appears that the individual did consider the aspect of sure outcomes but interpreted it in the context of risk assessment rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery without a sure outcome. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual preferred Lottery A because the sure outcome (0 Euros) was seen as practically guaranteed due to its high probability, not because Lottery A lacks a sure outcome. The individual's justification is based on the perceived risk rather than the mere presence or absence of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is no sure outcome since the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. For Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is that Lottery A does not have a sure outcome, while Lottery B has a sure outcome of 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical aspects of both lotteries, specifically the expected value (Mittelwert) of each. For Lottery A, the individual noted that over numerous attempts, the expected gain would be 0 Euros due to the equal probabilities of winning or losing 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the individual recognized that it offered a guaranteed (garantiert) gain of 1500 Euros due to its 100% probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the expected outcomes of both lotteries, emphasizing the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome as the decisive factor. The individual implies that the guarantee of 1500 Euros in Lottery B made the decision straightforward, suggesting that the absence of risk in Lottery B was a significant consideration.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in the lotteries. The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and the lack of a guaranteed outcome in Lottery A, aligning with the information relevant to the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. However, the individual's justification suggests a preference for the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B) because it guarantees a positive gain, contrary to the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as stated. The individual's decision was influenced by the presence of a sure outcome, but in a manner opposite to what the decision reason prescribes. The individual preferred the lottery with a sure outcome, whereas the decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros, while Lottery B does not offer a sure outcome, having a 50% chance of either 3000 Euros or -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. For Lottery A, there is a sure outcome of 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, there is no sure outcome. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison between a lottery with a 50% chance of 3000 Euros or -3000 Euros and a guaranteed option, noting that the guaranteed option (in this case, 2000 Euros) is now even more attractive than in previous similar decisions. The individual seems to consider the attractiveness of the sure outcome in relation to the risky option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual indicates that the decision was ""selfverständlich"" (obvious or straightforward), implying that the choice was clear based on the comparison made. However, the justification provided leans towards preferring the sure option, which contrasts with the decision reason that prefers the lottery without a sure outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which aligns with the information the individual considered (the attractiveness of the sure outcome versus the risky option). However, the individual's focus seems to be on the attractiveness of the sure outcome rather than the absence of a sure outcome being a preference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual’s justification suggests a preference for the sure outcome, indicating that the decision reason does not align with the individual’s justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report indicates that the individual preferred the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery A) because it was seen as more attractive, which directly contradicts the decision reason that prefers the lottery without a sure outcome (Lottery B). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is no sure outcome because it offers 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. For Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of 1000 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and it would prefer Lottery A because it does not have a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery B and compares it to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A, indicating an awareness of the sure outcome in Lottery B and the probabilistic nature of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by noting that while the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery B is significantly less than the potential win in Lottery A, it is still more than the expected value of Lottery A, implying a preference for the certainty of Lottery B over the uncertainty of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which the individual also considers. However, the individual's focus is on the value of the sure outcome in relation to the expected value of the other option, not strictly on the presence or absence of a sure outcome as the decision reason dictates.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome (Lottery A), but the individual's justification suggests a preference for the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B) because of its guaranteed positive value compared to the expected value of Lottery A. This indicates that the individual did not follow the rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the value of the sure outcome in relation to the expected value of the other lottery, and a preference for the sure outcome, which directly contradicts the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. 
In this decision problem, Lottery A has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with 100% probability, and Lottery B has no sure outcome but rather two possible outcomes with 50% probability each. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a sure outcome.
- Lottery B does not have a sure outcome.
This information is sufficient for the decision reason to be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered that one option (Lottery A) was not a lottery and had no risk, while the other option (Lottery B) had a risk of losing 6000 Euros. 
The individual focused on the potential loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery B and found it a decisive factor.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by excluding Lottery B due to the risk of losing 6000 Euros, stating that the probabilities became irrelevant at that point.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. 
However, the individual's consideration was more about the risk associated with the potential loss in Lottery B rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome per se.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. 
However, the individual preferred Lottery A because it had no risk of loss, not because it was looking for a sure outcome or avoiding one. 
The individual's justification is based on risk aversion regarding the potential loss, not on the principle of preferring a lottery without a sure outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision. 
The individual's focus was on avoiding risk rather than on the presence or absence of a sure outcome in the lotteries.
