STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the expected value is (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value is (2400 * 1) = 2400 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 2409 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B, mentioning that 2400 and 2500 Euros do not make a big difference for them, and they would not take a risk for 100 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual justified their choice by stating that Lottery B was risk-free, and they wanted to be on the safe side and definitely achieve a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The individual considered risk and the difference in outcomes, not explicitly the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification focuses on avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, not on comparing expected values.
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual's decision was driven more by risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed outcome rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as EV = (outcome * probability). For Lottery A, EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the sums to be won did not have a big difference in their opinion, and they decided based on the highest possible probability for a win.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had the highest possible probability for a win, not directly mentioning the expected value or comparing the monetary outcomes in a way that suggests calculating expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the highest possible probability for a win and the perceived similarity in potential winnings): The individual does not mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with the highest probability of winning): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as they chose based on probability rather than expected value.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 3200 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of a large sum in Lottery A and the risk of not winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that it was not worth taking the risk with Lottery B for a potentially higher amount, given that a large sum was guaranteed in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, but the individual's report focuses on the guarantee of a large sum in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification emphasizes the guarantee and risk, not explicitly the comparison of expected values. However, the individual does mention the idea of a ""somewhat higher amount"" in Lottery B, which could imply an implicit consideration of the magnitude of the potential outcomes, but it does not directly reflect the calculation or comparison of expected values as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects of the lotteries that could relate to expected value (like the guarantee and potential higher amount), they did not explicitly mention or directly apply the concept of expected value as the basis for their decision. The emphasis on risk and guarantee rather than a direct comparison of expected values suggests that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 750 Euros for Lottery A and 800 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the relatively high sum that can be won in Lottery A and its comparative probability to Lottery B, indicating they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the risk of Lottery B does not seem worth it, despite the potential for a higher win, because the probability of winning a significant amount in Lottery A is relatively higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities), it appears the individual considered relevant aspects but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the comparative probabilities and the risk associated with the higher potential win), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual seems more focused on the risk and comparative probabilities of winning rather than the outright expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered aspects related to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), but their justification focuses more on the comparative risk and probabilities rather than explicitly on the expected values of the lotteries. This indicates that while there might be some overlap in the considerations, the decision reason as defined (focusing on expected value) does not directly align with the individual's stated reasoning process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 Euros * 0.9) + (0 Euros * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of winning in each lottery, mentioning the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery A and perceiving it as ""almost 100%"". They also considered the risk associated with Lottery B, describing its probability as ""practically 50/50"", which they found too risky. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was to achieve a ""highly probable good win"" and to avoid the high risk they perceived in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and risk perception), it appears the individual focused more on the probabilities and the risk associated with each lottery rather than calculating or directly comparing the expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) with the individual's justification (avoiding high risk and seeking a highly probable win), it's evident that the individual's decision was more influenced by risk perception and probability of winning rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the risk and the high probability of winning in Lottery A, rather than on calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, which are actually equal. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery and chose the one with the higher chance of winning, aiming to keep the risk low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning and the desire to minimize risk, not explicitly on the expected values or the magnitude of the potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning and risk): The individual focused on the probabilities and risk, not the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning to minimize risk): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual chose based on probability and risk aversion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. For Lottery A, the calculation is straightforward: -3000 Euros * 100% = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the calculation is: (-4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = -3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (the expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -3000 Euros for Lottery A and -3200 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the possibility of not making a loss with Lottery B and the difference between losing 3000 Euros versus 4000 Euros. They seem to focus on the aspect of avoiding a larger loss and having a chance at no loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning the chance of avoiding any loss and downplaying the difference between the potential losses of the two lotteries, indicating a willingness to take a risk for the potential of no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which are -3000 Euros for Lottery A and -3200 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the chance of avoiding loss and the relative difference in potential losses, not explicitly on the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value (less negative in this case), which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different rationale that emphasizes the chance of no loss and minimizes the difference in loss amounts, not the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the possibility of avoiding a loss and the relative sizes of the losses, rather than on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected value was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as: EV_A = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value can be calculated as: EV_B = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher expected value (-750 Euros) compared to Lottery B (-800 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the percentages of not making a loss and the amounts of potential losses in both lotteries, noticing that the differences in loss amounts were not too significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the percentages of not making a loss seemed better, despite acknowledging the possibility of making greater losses compared to Lottery A, and considering the loss amounts were not vastly different.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the probabilities of not losing and the potential loss amounts, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which is Lottery A, but the individual chose Lottery B based on different criteria (probabilities of not losing and potential loss amounts).
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the expected value decision reason to make the decision, as they did not mention or imply calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, and the information relevant to the decision reason can indeed be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to have misinterpreted the probabilities of Lottery B, mentioning a ""50/50 chance"" instead of the actual 45% chance of losing 6000 Euros. They frame their decision as choosing between a certain loss of 3000 Euros and a gamble that could result in either no loss or a loss of 6000 Euros, albeit with incorrect probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual found the decision difficult but ultimately chose based on ""setting their luck"" because, to them, the difference between losing 3000 Euros and 6000 Euros was not significant once they had already ""lost.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did not accurately consider the expected values or the actual probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (based on a misinterpretation of probabilities and a focus on the perceived lesser loss in a gamble), it's clear the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason.

Ich habe gehofft, dass Lotterie B ein besseres Angebot aufweist. Als ich gesehen habe, dass es weniger Verlüste geben würde, blieb ich aufmerksam und sah mir die Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür an. Die war praktisch die selbe wie bei Lotterie A - allerdings waren die Verlüste ja geringe und dies habe ich mir gemerkt.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the calculation shows both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the large sum of money in Lottery A and its very low probability, which caused fear. They then looked at Lottery B, noticing fewer losses (lower potential loss amount) and a similar probability, which made them consider it a better offer because of potentially fewer losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over A because they perceived it as having ""weniger Verluste"" (fewer losses), theoretically, despite acknowledging the probabilities were practically the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the fear induced by the high potential loss in Lottery A and the perception of fewer losses in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the perception of risk (fear of loss) rather than a direct comparison of expected values. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The focus on fear of loss and perception of ""fewer losses"" rather than on the expected values indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (500 Euros * 100%) = 500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of getting 500 Euros versus the risk of getting 0 Euros with Lottery B, mentioning that the 50/50 risk was too risky.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that practically getting 500 Euros guaranteed was more worthwhile than taking a risk that could result in getting 0 Euros, indicating a preference for the certain outcome over the risky one due to the risk being too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more about the risk associated with Lottery B rather than directly comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. However, the individual's justification is based on risk aversion, preferring the guaranteed amount over the risky option, not directly on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, since the individual's focus was on risk aversion and the guarantee of an outcome rather than on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, which are equal.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-500 * 1) = -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -500 Euros for both lotteries. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered their luck and the 50/50 chance of not making a loss as significant factors. They also mentioned that the difference between losing 500 Euros or 1000 Euros does not make a big difference to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on their attitude towards risk and the perceived impact of the potential losses rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries (-500 Euros). However, the individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but rather focus on the chance of avoiding loss and the relative impact of different loss amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, does not clearly align with this rule, as it emphasizes luck and the relative indifference to the amount of loss rather than a preference based on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. Their considerations and justifications point towards factors other than the expected monetary value of the lotteries, such as luck and the psychological impact of loss, which do not align with the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the calculation shows that both lotteries are equal in terms of expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and potential winnings of both lotteries, noting the multiple ""Gewinn-Optionen"" (winning options) in Lottery A and the high potential win in Lottery B. They were initially drawn to Lottery A due to its multiple winning options and later considered Lottery B's high potential win but were concerned about the high probability of winning nothing.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A hoping to achieve at least one of the two possible wins, despite recognizing the sums were lower than in Lottery B. They later acknowledged a thinking error, realizing the probability of winning in Lottery A was not greater than in Lottery B but rather the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which were not explicitly calculated or compared by the individual in their verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification was based on the desire for multiple winning options and the perceived higher chance of winning something, not on the comparison of expected values.

Given these comparisons, the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason (comparing expected values) to make their decision. Instead, their choice was influenced by the perception of multiple winning options and the desire to win something, even if it was a lower amount.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV can be calculated as: (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1000 - 500 + 0 = -1500 Euros.
For Lottery B, the EV can be calculated as: (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 + 0 = -1500 Euros.
Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -1500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential for a very large loss with Lottery B and notes that with Lottery A, they can only lose less than with Lottery B, regardless of the winning probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the potential loss, implying a preference for the option that minimizes the maximum potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential for loss), it seems the individual focuses on the potential loss rather than the expected value.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (prefer the option that minimizes the maximum potential loss), the two rules do not align. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value, but the individual's justification suggests a preference based on loss aversion rather than expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on minimizing potential loss rather than considering the expected values of the lotteries, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined by preferring the lottery with the higher expected value, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5 * 1) = 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. The expected values of both lotteries are equal, 5 Euros.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process, focusing on the low probability of winning in Lottery A, which made it seem unlikely to win at all. The individual then chose Lottery B because its amount, although small, was guaranteed. The information considered by the individual includes the probability of winning in Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B. The individual’s justification for the choice is based on the guarantee of the outcome in Lottery B, given the perceived unlikelihood of winning in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of Lottery B), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the lotteries. Instead, the focus was on the probability of winning and the guarantee. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the rule would suggest indifference. However, the individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the guarantee, not a direct comparison of expected values. This suggests that while the outcome aligns with what could be a consideration of expected value (in the case of a tie, choosing the guaranteed option could be a personal preference), the reasoning process described does not directly apply the decision reason regarding expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice could align with a consideration of expected values (given the tie, choosing the guaranteed option), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. The focus was on the probability of winning and the guarantee, rather than a direct calculation or consideration of expected values."

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is EV_B = -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are -5 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the small probability of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery B, indicating they are weighing the potential losses.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even with a small probability, is not worth the risk when compared to the certain loss of 5 Euros, which they find more acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, which are the same for both. However, the individual focuses on the risk of significant loss and the acceptability of smaller losses rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value (-5 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, prefers Lottery B because the certain loss of 5 Euros is more acceptable than the risk of losing 5000 Euros, even with a very low probability. This preference is based on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus is on the acceptability of risk and potential losses rather than on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the expected values are equal and the individual's justification does not involve comparing these values, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""keine Verluste"" (no losses) and ""100%ige Gewinnchancen"" (100% chance of winning) for Lottery A, indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A. They also mention the risk of making a loss with Lottery B as ""sehr unattraktiv"" (very unattractive), showing they considered the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the avoidance of loss and the certainty of gain with Lottery A, rather than directly comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focuses on the absence of risk in Lottery A and the presence of risk in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification, while not explicitly about expected values, does lead to the selection of Lottery A, but based on risk avoidance rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process. Instead, it highlights risk avoidance and the certainty of the outcome as key factors. While the outcome of their decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process described does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values, suggesting that the decision reason was not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, let's break down the process into the required steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery B, EV = (2000 * 1) = 2000. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes and their probabilities, which are provided. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery A, the potential for a high gain, and the certainty of a positive outcome in Lottery B. They weighed the risk of loss against the potential for gain in Lottery A and compared it to the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offered a certain gain, which they perceived as a better deal compared to the risky outcome of Lottery A. They were swayed by the 100% chance of winning a significant amount in Lottery B and considered it foolish to pass up this guaranteed gain for the uncertain outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, but the individual's deliberation centered more on the risk of loss, the potential for gain, and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B. While they did consider the potential outcomes and their probabilities, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but based their decision on the certainty and attractiveness of the gain rather than an explicit comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification align with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but their reasoning as described does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries. The focus was more on the risk and certainty aspects rather than a direct application of expected value calculations. Thus, while the outcome matches, the process described does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason based on expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 1000 Euros * 100% = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, summarizing that Lottery A has an EV of 1000 Euros and Lottery B has an EV of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B, alongside the potential for a greater win in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it guarantees a win, and the risk of loss in Lottery B was not worth the potential for a greater win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win in A, risk of loss and potential greater win in B): While the individual does not explicitly mention expected values, their considerations implicitly touch on the concept of risk and guaranteed outcomes, which are related to the expected value calculation in the context of risk aversion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the guaranteed win over the risk of loss for a potential greater win): The individual's justification aligns with preferring a certain, positive outcome (Lottery A) over a risky option with an equal chance of significant loss or gain (Lottery B), which indirectly suggests a preference for the higher expected value when considering risk aversion.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to align with the principle of preferring the option with the more favorable outcome in terms of risk and reward, even though they do not explicitly calculate or mention expected values. The emphasis on the guaranteed win and the avoidance of risk suggests a decision-making process that could be consistent with preferring the higher expected value when risk aversion is considered.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 Euros * 0.5) + (-6000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the EV = (0 Euros * 1) = 0 Euros. Both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros. This means the decision reason can be applied, but it would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""50% chance of making a big loss,"" which indicates they considered the probability and the potential loss of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that a 50% chance of a big loss ""is simply not worth it"" for them, indicating a risk-averse attitude towards the potential loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the risk of a big loss rather than the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal expected values, but the individual shows a clear preference for avoiding the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than making a choice based on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process but rather a focus on avoiding risk, suggesting that the decision reason based on expected value was not used."
