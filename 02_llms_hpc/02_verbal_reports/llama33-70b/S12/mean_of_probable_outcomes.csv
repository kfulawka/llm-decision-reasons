STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 (100%). 
- For Lottery B, the probable outcomes are 2500 Euros with 33% probability and 2400 Euros with 66% probability, because both probabilities are higher than 33.33%. The 0 Euros outcome with 1% probability is not considered probable.
- For Lottery A, the outcome 2400 Euros with 100% probability is considered probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (2500*0.33 + 2400*0.66) / (0.33 + 0.66) = (825 + 1584) / 0.99 = 2419 / 0.99 ≈ 2443.43 Euros. For Lottery A, it is simply 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Option A because ""der Gewinn sicher ist,"" which translates to ""the gain is secure."" This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A as a primary factor in their decision. 
- Information considered by the individual: The certainty of the gain in Lottery A.
- Justification for the choice: The security of the gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain), it appears the individual focused on the certainty aspect rather than calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes. 
Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (security of the gain), there is a discrepancy. The decision reason would suggest calculating and comparing averages, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification is based on the absolute certainty of the outcome in Lottery A, not on the comparison of averages of probable outcomes between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is lower than 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is lower than 50%. Therefore, for both lotteries, only the 0 Euro outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. The decision reason can be applied, but it results in both lotteries having the same average probable outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are roughly the same (""Fast die selbe Wahrscheinlichkeit""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. However, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn""), which implies they compared the potential winnings of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual, however, considered the probabilities being roughly the same but decided based on the higher gain, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the higher potential gain, not the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's criteria for evaluating lotteries. The individual focused on the higher potential gain and the similarity in probabilities, without mentioning or implying the calculation of average probable outcomes as the basis for their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 
For Lottery A, there are two outcomes: 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Since the probability threshold for an outcome to be considered probable is 1 divided by the number of outcomes (1/2 = 0.5 for both lotteries), both outcomes of Lottery A are considered because 80% is greater than 50%, but 20% is less than 50%. However, according to the reason, only outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold are considered probable. Thus, for Lottery A, only the 4000 Euros outcome is considered probable.
For Lottery B, there is one outcome: 3000 Euros with 100% probability. This outcome is considered probable since 100% is greater than 50%.

The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Average of probable outcomes = 4000 Euros (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is probable)
- Lottery B: Average of probable outcomes = 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""100% probability of having a low amount guaranteed,"" which suggests they considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a low amount with 100% probability, implying they valued the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the average of probable outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B). The individual's consideration of the guaranteed amount in Lottery B aligns with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes, but the individual does not explicitly discuss averaging these outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification (valuing the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they do not mention comparing averages of probable outcomes but rather focus on the guarantee provided by Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the guarantee of Lottery B and lack of discussion about comparing averages of probable outcomes between the lotteries suggest that they did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. However, their consideration of the certain outcome in Lottery B indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes, preventing a complete dismissal of the decision reason's influence. Thus, the assessment is low but not at the minimum, indicating that while the decision reason might have had some indirect influence, it was not the primary or explicit reason for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we evaluate whether the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is greater than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, which is greater than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, which is greater than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes would not differentiate between the two based on the given probabilities and outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the higher payout of Option B and the better odds (quote) of Option A. They noted that the odds of the two options differ by only 5 percentage points, suggesting they considered the difference in probabilities between the two options.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Option B because, despite A having better odds, the difference in odds is small (5 percentage points), implying the individual weighed the potential gain against the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as determined, would be 0 Euros for both lotteries, not directly aligning with the individual's focus on the difference in payouts and odds.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), this reason does not provide a basis for differentiation. The individual, however, chose based on the potential gain and the relatively small difference in odds, not explicitly considering the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries in this case, whereas the individual's choice was based on a comparison of payouts and the relative difference in probabilities, not the specific rule of averaging probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 3000 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only one outcome in each lottery is probable, the average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros and for Lottery A is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Option A because ""die Wahrscheinlichkeit auf einen Gewinn größer ist,"" which translates to ""the probability of a win is greater."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning in each lottery. The justification for the choice focuses on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes based on probabilities higher than 50%) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), it seems the individual considered the aspect of probability but not exactly in the manner defined by the decision reason (focusing on outcomes with probabilities greater than 50%).
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of winning), there's a conceptual alignment in that both involve comparing probabilities, but the decision reason specifically averages probable outcomes, which the individual's justification does not explicitly mention.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision process involves considering probabilities, which is a key component of the decision reason, the specific application and rule defined by the decision reason (averaging probable outcomes based on a 50% threshold) are not clearly reflected in the verbal report. The individual's justification is more about the general probability of winning rather than the specific calculation of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. 
Thus, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros for both lotteries. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 0 Euros. 
The information relevant to the decision reason is the average of probable outcomes for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of both options and noted that they are low. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with more money, implying that they prioritized the potential gain despite the low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual considered the overall probabilities and the amount of money, not specifically the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the average of probable outcomes since both are 0. The individual, however, chose based on the potential for more money, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not follow the decision reason’s specific criteria for evaluating the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes for that lottery. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since 100% is always higher than 1/1 or 100%.

- Lottery B has two outcomes: -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Only the -4000 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
- Lottery A has one outcome: -3000 Euros with 100% probability, which is probable.

The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. 
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is -4000 Euros (since only -4000 Euros is considered probable).
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possibility of getting 0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery B, implying they are considering the outcomes of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the aspect of not receiving a negative amount in Lottery B with a certain probability but does not explicitly discuss the comparison of averages of probable outcomes between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes for each lottery, but the individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate they calculated or compared these averages. Instead, they focus on the positive aspect of potentially not losing money in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing averages of outcomes based on their probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason as outlined. The verbal report lacks a clear discussion on comparing the averages of probable outcomes, which is central to the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the -4000 Euros outcome has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the -3000 Euros outcome has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros since the only probable outcome for both is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""mit weniger Schulden aus dem Spiel geht,"" which translates to ""leaving the game with less debt."" This implies the individual considered the potential losses (debt) from each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option B, justifying it with the idea of ending up with less debt, which suggests a focus on minimizing potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the potential debt, which aligns with considering outcomes but not explicitly with calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would not differentiate between the lotteries based on their probable outcomes since both have 0 Euros as the probable outcome. However, the individual's justification implies a differentiation based on the potential debt, suggesting a preference for the lottery with the lesser loss (-3000 Euros in Lottery B compared to -4000 Euros in Lottery A), even though this wasn't directly about calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on minimizing debt and the specific mention of ""less debt"" suggests an awareness of the potential losses, but this does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially since the probable outcomes for both lotteries are the same (0 Euros). The individual's reasoning seems to be more about avoiding the larger loss rather than calculating averages of probable outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the choice."

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the -6000 Euros outcome has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery A, the -3000 Euros outcome has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is -3000 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of getting 0 Euros versus incurring a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option B because the chance of getting 0 Euros (instead of a loss) is greater.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating probabilities and identifying outcomes with probabilities greater than 50%. The individual considered the chance of avoiding a loss, which indirectly relates to the probability of the 0 Euros outcome but does not explicitly discuss averaging probable outcomes or the specific probability threshold of 50%.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is about avoiding a loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery where the chance of not losing (getting 0 Euros) is higher, but does not explicitly mention calculating an average of probable outcomes based on the 50% probability threshold.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to intuitively align with aspects of the decision reason, such as considering the probability of avoiding a loss (which is related to the concept of probable outcomes), but does not directly apply the rule of averaging probable outcomes based on the specified probability threshold. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating averages of probable outcomes or applying the specific probability threshold, which are key components of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's justification does not directly align with the specific steps and calculations involved in the decision reason, despite some intuitive alignment with the concept of avoiding losses and considering probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Since 99.9% is higher than 0.5, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable.
For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. Similarly, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable because its probability (99.8%) is higher than 0.5.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, noting they are almost equal.
Second, the individual justified their choice by deciding on the ""kleineren Verlust,"" which translates to ""smaller loss."" This implies the individual compared the potential losses of the two lotteries and chose the one with the smaller loss, which is Lottery A with a potential loss of -3000 Euros compared to Lottery B's -6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the size of losses), it appears the individual focused more on the size of the potential losses rather than the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (choosing the smaller loss), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), but the individual chose based on a different criterion (size of the loss).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there's one outcome (500 Euros), so the threshold is 1/1 = 1 (or 100%). The outcome of 500 Euros meets this threshold because its probability is 100%. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so the threshold is 1/2 = 0.5 (or 50%). Both outcomes (1000 Euros and 0 Euros) meet this threshold because their probabilities are both 50%, which equals the threshold. Thus, the probable outcomes are 500 Euros for Lottery A and both 1000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is (1000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but in this case, both lotteries have the same average.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A (100% chance of 500 Euros) and the uncertainty of the gain in Lottery B (50% chance of 1000 Euros and 50% chance of 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the gain was 100% certain, as opposed to Lottery B, which had a 50-50 chance and the risk of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the gain rather than the comparison of averages of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 or 100%, which is always true for the single outcome. 
For Lottery A, both outcomes (-1000 Euros and 0 Euros) have a 50% probability, making both probable according to the decision reason's criteria. 
For Lottery B, the single outcome (-500 Euros) has a 100% probability, making it probable.
The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: probable outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: the probable outcome is -500 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (-1000 + 0)/2 = -500 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the 50-50 chance of at least getting 0 Euros with Lottery A and the certainty of loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the certainty of loss in Lottery B compared to the chance of not losing anything in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating or comparing the outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual discusses the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating an average or comparing averages between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification focuses on the aspect of certainty and chance of not losing, which aligns with considering outcomes but does not directly address the comparison of averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates consideration of the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, which is a necessary aspect of the decision reason. However, there is no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the consideration of probabilities and outcomes, the report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason's specific rule (comparing averages of probable outcomes) was used. This suggests that the decision reason might have influenced the individual's thought process indirectly but was not directly applied as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery based on the decision reason's criteria. For Lottery A, there are three outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 (approximately 0.33). For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 (0.5). 
- Lottery A: 4000 Euros with 25% probability, 2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable because 50% is greater than 1/3.
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable because 75% is greater than 1/2.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable). For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is also 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report mentions ""Option A, da man dort eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit hat einen Gewinn zu machen,"" which translates to ""Option A, because there is a higher probability of making a profit."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of winning (making a profit) in their deliberation. Their justification for choosing Option A is based on the perceived higher probability of winning something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the average of probable outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the probability of making a profit), it seems the individual focused on the likelihood of winning any amount, not specifically on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but in this case, both lotteries have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros, making them equal according to the reason. However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing averages of probable outcomes or considering the specific probabilities of each outcome in the manner the decision reason dictates. Instead, the individual chose based on a perceived higher chance of winning, which aligns more with an intuitive understanding of probability rather than the specific calculation of average probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 possible outcomes (-6000 Euros, 0 Euros, and implicitly, no other outcome is mentioned, so we consider only these two as relevant for the decision reason, given the context), but only 2 are provided, and for Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes (-4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, 0 Euros). For Lottery A, 1/2 = 0.5, so only outcomes with a probability higher than 0.5 are considered probable. For Lottery B, 1/3 = 0.33, so outcomes with probabilities higher than 0.33 are considered probable. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome ""0 Euros"" with 75% probability is considered probable.
- For Lottery B, the outcome ""0 Euros"" with 50% probability is considered probable since it's the only one meeting the criteria given its probability is exactly on the threshold for a 3-outcome scenario, but considering the context, it might be misunderstood. However, strictly following the given probabilities, ""0 Euros"" with 50% does meet the criteria for being probable in a scenario where we strictly interpret ""higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes"" as applicable for consideration but recognize the unique situation here.

The relevant information for the decision reason includes identifying the probable outcomes and calculating their average for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because of the higher probability of ending up with 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which requires identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold and calculating their average. The individual, however, focuses on the probability of ending up with 0 Euros, which aligns partially with identifying probable outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating an average or comparing averages between lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of a specific outcome (0 Euros), which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of a single outcome (0 Euros) without mentioning the calculation of averages of probable outcomes or comparing these averages between the two lotteries suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not used to make the decision. The verbal report indicates a different rationale for the choice, emphasizing the probability of a specific outcome rather than the average of probable outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (5 Euros with 100% probability), so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1, which is not applicable since the only outcome has a 100% probability, making it probable by default. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Only the 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability meets this criterion. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 5 Euros (since the only outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable). Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of Option A and the low probability of achieving a high gain with Option B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual views Option A as safe and Option B as relatively unlikely to realize a high gain, implying a focus on the probability of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than a certain threshold. The individual considers the safety of Option A and the low probability of a high gain in Option B, which aligns with focusing on the likelihood of outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Option A is based on its safety and the low probability of Option B's high gain, which does not directly mention averaging probable outcomes but does reflect a preference for the more certain option.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with the general principle of preferring more certain outcomes, but it does not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific rule of calculating the average of probable outcomes. However, the emphasis on safety and the low probability of high gains in Option B suggests an intuitive application of the concept, albeit without explicit calculation or mention of ""probable outcomes"" as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. The outcomes are -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. The outcome is -5 Euros with 100% probability, which is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of an outcome in Option A but does not specify which outcome. However, the context implies they are considering the low probability of the -5000 Euros outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose Option B despite acknowledging the low probability of a negative outcome in Option A. The justification is not explicitly stated in terms of comparing outcomes or their probabilities, but the decision to choose B implies that the certain loss of -5 Euros is preferred over the low-probability significant loss of -5000 Euros in A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is -5 Euros. The individual considers the low probability of an outcome in A but does not explicitly discuss averages of probable outcomes or compare them between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A (0 Euros) over Lottery B (-5 Euros). However, the individual chooses Lottery B, which suggests they did not follow the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with a 50% probability. Since there are two outcomes, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A meet this criterion. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability, which also meets the criterion. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (3000 + (-3000))/2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1500 Euros.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process, focusing on the certainty of the gain with Option B and the risk of losing with Option A. The information considered by the individual includes the guaranteed win of Option B and the potential loss of Option A. The individual’s justification for choosing Option B is based on having a secure gain and avoiding the possibility of a negative outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the average of probable outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk of loss), there is a partial alignment. The decision reason emphasizes the average outcome, which indirectly touches upon the idea of avoiding negative outcomes and preferring a secure gain. However, the decision reason specifically calculates an average, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding loss and preferring a secure gain) aligns with the general direction of preferring a higher average of probable outcomes but does not explicitly calculate or mention averages. Therefore, while there is some conceptual overlap, the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason’s specific rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since the probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Both are probable since 50% is exactly 1/2, but based on the strict definition given (higher than 1/2), neither outcome would technically be considered probable under a strict interpretation. However, considering the context, it seems there might be an intention to include outcomes with probabilities of 1/2 or higher, but the definition provided suggests a strict ""higher than"" criterion. Thus, technically, neither outcome of Lottery B meets the criterion as stated.
- Lottery A has one outcome: 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which is considered probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason that can be derived from the lotteries is that Lottery A has a probable outcome of 2000 Euros, and Lottery B's outcomes do not strictly meet the ""probable"" criterion as defined due to the ""higher than"" requirement.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Option A guarantees a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option A because it guarantees a win, implying a preference for a certain gain over a risky option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual considered the guarantee of a win in Option A, which aligns with focusing on the certain outcome but does not explicitly discuss the concept of ""probable outcomes"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the guarantee of a positive outcome, which indirectly aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome (2000 Euros) over an uncertain one but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given the information and the comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align with preferring a certain gain (which could be seen as having a ""higher average of probable outcomes"" when considering the certain outcome of Lottery A and the lack of strictly ""probable"" outcomes in Lottery B under the given definition), but the explicit mention of ""guarantee of a win"" rather than calculation of probable outcomes or their averages suggests the decision reason might not have been the primary or explicit basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects a leaning towards the decision reason not being explicitly used, as the individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of a win rather than the specific calculation or comparison of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. However, the choice does align with what the decision reason would suggest in this scenario (preferring the lottery with a certain positive outcome over one with risky outcomes), which prevents a complete dismissal of its influence."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, which exactly meets this threshold, but given the context, it seems logical to interpret the rule as considering outcomes with probabilities greater than 50% as more significant. However, strictly following the given definition, both outcomes are at the threshold. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome with a probability greater than 1/1 or 100% is considered probable, but since the maximum probability is 100%, the outcome of 1000 Euros is considered probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery A, this could be interpreted as considering both outcomes due to their probabilities being exactly at the threshold, leading to an average of (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the average of the probable outcome is 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""da dort der Gewinn sicher ist und man keinen Verlust machen kann,"" which translates to ""because the profit is secure there and one cannot make a loss."" This indicates the individual considered the certainty of gain and the avoidance of loss in their decision. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is based on the security of the gain and the impossibility of making a loss with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, while the individual focuses on the security of the gain and avoidance of loss. These are related but distinct perspectives; the decision reason is more about the mathematical expectation based on probabilities, whereas the individual's reasoning is more about risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which, based on the strict interpretation provided, would be Lottery B because it has a certain outcome of 1000 Euros. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B, but for different explicitly stated reasons (security and no loss).

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (both lead to the choice of Lottery B) but does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes as defined. The individual's emphasis is on the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculation of averages based on probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria of considering the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual's focus on the security of the gain and avoidance of loss indicates a different, more risk-averse reasoning process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, let's follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, they are both considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their respective probabilities. For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes would be (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to focus on the risk aspect (""No Risk, no Fun"") and mentions the 50-50 probability of Lottery B. This suggests the individual considers the probabilities of the outcomes but does not explicitly calculate or compare averages of outcomes.

Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification (""Immerhin 50 zu 50"" which translates to ""at least 50 to 50"") implies an acknowledgment of the risk but does not clearly articulate a preference based on the average of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities (50-50) but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason requires.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Given that both lotteries have an average of 0 Euros for their probable outcomes, the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, as it focuses more on the presence of risk rather than the average outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report does not demonstrate a clear consideration of the average outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for the decision.
