STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the 33% chance of winning more in Lottery A than in Lottery B and views the risk of winning nothing as very low (""verschwindend gering"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the potential higher gain is worth the small risk of winning nothing, despite acknowledging this risk as very low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential for higher gain and the perceived low risk of winning nothing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher gain and the acceptance of a small risk, not explicitly on the mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual calculated or considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be influenced by the potential for a higher gain and the perceived risk, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities of winning and the potential gain of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potentially higher gain because the probabilities of winning were similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. The individual considered the potential gain and the similarity in probabilities, not explicitly the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B. The individual chose based on the potentially higher gain, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the ""potentially higher gain"" aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. This suggests some alignment with the decision reason but lacks clear evidence of using the specific rule of calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with uncertainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. 
For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. 
For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. 
The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. 
The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the risk of gaining nothing in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual preferred the certainty of 3000 Euros over the risk of potentially gaining nothing, indicating a preference for the guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual did not explicitly mention calculating the mean outcomes of the lotteries, but rather focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk in Lottery B. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, while the individual preferred the lottery with the guaranteed outcome, which happens to be the one with the higher mean outcome in this case, but the reasoning process described does not directly align with calculating and comparing mean outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification is based on risk aversion rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. Since 2000 Euros (mean of Lottery B) is greater than 1500 Euros (mean of Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The information relevant to this decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a higher probability of winning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-3000 Euros) is lower than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery B is preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the importance of having a chance to not lose money in one of the lotteries, implying they looked at the presence of a 0 Euro outcome in Lottery B and compared it to the certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the preference for participating in a lottery where there's a chance of not losing money, rather than choosing an option where a loss is certain from the start.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the chance of not losing money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery B because of its higher mean outcome, whereas the individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing money, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcome or comparing the sums of outcomes.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -1500 is greater than -2000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions having to look at the probabilities several times, indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes. They also mention deciding based on the ""potentiell geringeren Verlust,"" which translates to ""potentially smaller loss.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the potential for a smaller loss, which implies a focus on minimizing the negative outcome rather than calculating a mean outcome based on all possible outcomes regardless of their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean of all outcomes, while the individual considered probabilities and the potential size of the loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery based on the potential for a smaller loss. The individual's focus on minimizing loss aligns more closely with expected utility or loss aversion principles rather than the mean outcome calculation described by the decision reason.

9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the probabilities and noticed that Lottery A had a high probability of losing money, while Lottery B had a 55% chance of not losing money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus was on the probabilities of losing or not losing money in each lottery, particularly noting the higher chance of not losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities of losing or not losing, not on calculating mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), but the individual's justification is based on the probability of not losing money, which seems to favor Lottery B based on the verbal report.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing money in Lottery A (0.2%) and seems to weigh this against the potential loss, indicating an awareness of both the probability and the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the low probability of losing money and the preference for a ""something higher risk"" but with less loss, suggesting a consideration of both risk (probability) and the amount of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean of the outcomes, which does not directly involve probabilities. However, the individual considers probabilities and the amount of potential loss, not just the mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is based on the probability of losing and the amount of loss, rather than the mean outcome calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. The individual's reasoning seems to involve a more nuanced consideration of risk and loss rather than a straightforward calculation of mean outcomes.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since the mean outcomes are the same for both lotteries, according to this reason, the individual should be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions wanting to ""be on the safe side"" (""auf Nummer sicher gehen""), which implies considering the risk or certainty of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it was the safer option, implying that the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B was a key factor in the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which does not directly relate to the individual's consideration of safety or certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chose Lottery B specifically because it was seen as safer, not because of the mean outcome.

For Lottery A, the calculation is (-500)/1 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, it is (-1000 + 0)/2 = -500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, and the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss and the desire to gain at least +1500 Euros, indicating a focus on potential gains and risk aversion to losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to potentially gain (implied by the mention of +1500 Euros, though the lottery does not offer such an outcome, suggesting a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lottery's potential outcomes) and perceived the risk of losing in Lottery A as too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on potential gains and risk aversion to specific losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual chose based on a desire for a high gain and risk perception, not the mean outcome as calculated by the decision reason.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the possibility of winning more money and a higher felt possible gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their number) with that considered by the individual (potential to win more money, felt possible gain): The individual's considerations align with the general idea of comparing outcomes but do not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or considering the number of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the possibility of winning more and the felt possible gain): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or using the specific rule of the decision reason.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros, and since there's only one outcome, the mean is -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A with a mean of -5 Euros over Lottery B with a mean of -2500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions avoiding risk and the importance of not losing a significant amount of money, preferring to lose a smaller amount (5 Euros) to be ""on the safe side.""
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by prioritizing risk avoidance and preferring a certain, smaller loss over a potential larger loss, even if the latter has a very low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, while the individual focuses on risk avoidance and the preference for a certain, smaller loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome based on a simple arithmetic mean calculation, disregarding probabilities. The individual's justification, however, is centered around risk avoidance and the desire to minimize potential significant losses, not explicitly on calculating means or comparing outcomes in the manner described by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on risk avoidance and preference for a certain, smaller loss does not align with the decision reason's method of calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries independent of their probabilities.

For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, so its mean outcome is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically the 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros, and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to take the safe route and avoid the high risk of losing money in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries (1500 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B), whereas the individual focused on the risk and certainty of the outcomes, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding risk rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries or made their decision based on comparing these means. Instead, their decision was driven by a desire to avoid risk, which aligns with a risk-averse approach but not with the specific decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery B and the risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guaranteed a win of 2000 Euros, and the risk of losing money with Lottery A was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guarantee of winning and risk of losing), we see that the individual focused on the guarantee and risk rather than calculating means of outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the guaranteed win due to high risk in the other option), it's clear that the individual's justification does not directly align with calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on the guarantee of winning and the risk of losing money does not align with the decision reason's emphasis on mean outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""die Sicherheit"" (safety or certainty) of winning something was more important. This implies the individual considered the aspect of guaranteed outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of winning, indicating a preference for a guaranteed positive outcome over a risky one, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of mean outcomes, which does not directly relate to the individual's focus on the certainty of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of winning, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty of winning and lack of mention of mean outcomes or their calculation suggests that the decision reason, which specifically considers the mean of all outcomes, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 0 Euros. Since the mean outcomes can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of the lotteries and the individual's past behavior (playing it safe in previous rounds). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the desire to take a risk after having been cautious in the past and having a buffer to absorb potential losses. The individual does not mention the mean outcomes of the lotteries or any explicit calculation of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) does not match the information considered by the individual (probabilities and past behavior). 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (taking a risk after being cautious in the past). 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.
