STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2400 Euros. The probabilities relevant to the decision reason are the overall probability distributions of both lotteries, but since the reason considers differences in probabilities negligible, it focuses on the maximum outcomes. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A being slightly higher, the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A, and the fact that both lotteries offer high or secure probabilities of winning, with Lottery A offering a 33% chance of an additional 100 Euro gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by stating that the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A is compensated by other factors, implying that the benefits (like the higher maximum outcome and the additional gain) outweigh the risks.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered multiple factors including the maximum outcomes and the additional gain but also focused on the expected value and the specific probabilities, which goes beyond just the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification does mention the benefits of Lottery A, including the potential for a higher gain, but also considers the trade-offs with the risk of winning nothing, which suggests a more nuanced decision-making process than the decision reason alone.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, considers more factors than just the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences, which are the core components of the decision reason. While the individual does mention the higher potential gain of Lottery A, the emphasis on expected value, compensation for risks, and specific probability considerations suggests that the decision reason was not the sole or primary basis for the decision. Therefore, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating that it is more likely than not that the decision reason was not used by the individual, but there is still some alignment with the reason's preference for the higher maximum outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 2500 Euros with a 33% probability, and Lottery B offers 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The probabilities are indeed very close, with only a 1% difference, which could be considered negligible. The maximum outcomes are 2500 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B, with Lottery A having the more favorable maximum outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value and that the winnings and probabilities are very similar. They also mention the difference between the possible winnings is not very high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a slightly increased winning probability, despite acknowledging the similarities and the not very high difference in possible winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, focuses on the similarity in expected values and the slight difference in winning probabilities, not explicitly on the maximum outcomes as the primary criterion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome when the probability difference is negligible. In contrast, the individual chose Lottery B because of its slightly higher winning probability, not because of its maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the expected value, the similarity in probabilities, and the choice based on a slightly higher winning probability for Lottery B, rather than the maximum outcome, indicates that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum outcomes of 3000 Euros and 4000 Euros, and their respective probabilities of 100% and 80%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery and the fact that Lottery A offers a certain gain while Lottery B offers a chance at a higher gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to Lottery B which only offers a chance at a higher gain, despite Lottery B having a slightly higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, considering the differences in probabilities negligible. The individual, however, focused on the expected values and the certainty of the gain, not directly comparing the maximum outcomes under the premise of negligible probability differences. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, which would suggest preferring Lottery B for its higher maximum outcome. However, the individual preferred Lottery A due to its certainty, not because of its maximum outcome being more favorable under the condition of negligible probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 25% probability, and Lottery B offers 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The maximum outcomes are 4000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A. The probabilities (25% for A and 20% for B) could be considered relatively close, especially in a context where their difference might be deemed negligible. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (4000 Euros for B and 3000 Euros for A) and the assessment that their probabilities are sufficiently similar.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the expected value of Lottery B being slightly higher, the probability of winning being slightly higher for A, and the potential gain being significantly higher for B. The individual also notes that the probabilities are very similar.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the higher potential gain of Lottery B, despite acknowledging that the probability of winning is slightly higher for A. The individual decided in favor of B due to its higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and the similarity of probabilities) with that considered by the individual, we see a match. The individual considered the higher potential gain (maximum outcome) of Lottery B and noted the probabilities were similar.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) with the individual's justification (choosing B due to its higher potential gain and considering the probabilities as very similar), there is a clear alignment. The individual's decision process, as described, closely follows the logic of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's criteria, focusing on the maximum outcomes and considering the probabilities to be similar enough to prioritize the higher potential gain. This indicates a high certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A, 3000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (45% for A, 90% for B). However, the decision reason specifically mentions considering the differences between the probabilities as negligible, which might not directly apply here since the probability difference is quite significant (45% vs. 90%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, recognizes Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high gain, and Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount of Lottery A's maximum gain. They also acknowledge the higher chance of winning with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because the chance of winning is significantly higher with B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's consideration includes the probabilities and the expected values, not just focusing on the maximum outcomes when probabilities are similar.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are similar, but the individual chose based on the higher probability of winning, not the maximum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided, as the individual prioritized the probability of winning over the maximum possible outcome, and the decision reason's condition for negligible probability differences does not apply here due to the significant difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The probability difference (0.2% - 0.1% = 0.1%) might be considered negligible given the context that both probabilities are very low. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A, 3000 Euros for B) and the assessment that the probability difference is negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers a chance at a twice-as-high win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having a very low probability of winning, Lottery A offers a higher potential win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the maximum outcomes and the low probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically mentions considering the differences between the probabilities as negligible, which the individual does not explicitly mention but implies by focusing on the maximum outcomes given the low probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a higher potential win, given that winning is very unlikely in both cases, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning closely aligns with the decision reason, focusing on the higher potential win of Lottery A given the negligible difference in probabilities (implied by the low probability of winning in both cases). The individual does not explicitly state that the probability differences are negligible, but their decision-making process, as described, effectively treats the probabilities as such by focusing on the maximum outcomes. Therefore, while there is a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, it is not a perfect match due to the lack of explicit mention of negligible probability differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (no loss), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also -3000 Euros, but since it's a certain outcome, it's not more favorable than the possibility of no loss in Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the consideration of their probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery, the fact that Lottery B offers a certain loss, and that Lottery A has a probability of no loss. They also considered the magnitude of the losses in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite having a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B, it offers a chance of no loss, which was a significant factor given that the magnitude of the potential losses in both lotteries is similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of no loss (which relates to the maximum outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery A) and the certainty of loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the favorable aspect of having a chance of no loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the chance of no loss in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B, and their decision based on these factors, closely aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are not the deciding factor. However, the individual also mentions the expected values and the magnitude of losses, which are not directly part of the decision reason. Therefore, while the decision reason seems to have played a significant role, it might not have been the sole or perfectly matching reason for the choice, leading to a high but not absolute certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences in probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and -4000 Euros respectively, with probabilities of 25% and 20%. The maximum outcome (or the least negative outcome) is more favorable in Lottery A. The probabilities of losing are 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B, which could be considered relatively close, especially in the context of the decision reason where differences are deemed negligible if they do not significantly impact the decision. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A to be slightly higher, acknowledged that both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss, and noted that the loss in Lottery A is lower and only marginally more probable than in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a slightly higher expected value, a lower loss amount, and this loss is only marginally more probable than the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual also considered expected values and the comparative magnitudes of potential losses, not just the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are deemed negligible, but the individual's justification is based on a combination of expected value, loss magnitude, and the comparative probabilities of these losses.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process involved a more nuanced evaluation than the decision reason alone, incorporating expected value calculations and a more detailed consideration of loss probabilities and magnitudes. However, the individual does acknowledge the lower loss in Lottery A as a factor, which aligns with preferring a more favorable outcome (less negative loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are elements of the individual's decision process that align with the decision reason (such as considering the more favorable outcome in terms of loss), the overall justification provided by the individual incorporates additional factors (like expected value and a more detailed probability assessment) that go beyond the simple preference for the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the sole or primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A and -6000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (90% for A and 45% for B). Since the probabilities are not the same, we need to evaluate if their differences are considered negligible by the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, noting they are the same. They also considered the high loss probabilities of both lotteries but observed that Lottery A has a higher loss probability than Lottery B. Specifically, the individual noted that a loss in Lottery A is very likely, whereas a loss in Lottery B is only half as likely, despite the potential loss in B being twice as high.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because, although the potential loss in B is higher, the difference in probabilities (with B having a lower loss probability) was deemed significant enough to outweigh the potential greater loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences. The individual, however, focused on the expected values, loss probabilities, and the comparative likelihoods of losses, not directly on the maximum outcomes or explicitly stating the negligibility of probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual chose Lottery B because of its lower loss probability, despite its higher potential loss, which does not directly align with preferring the lottery based on its maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's decision was influenced by the comparison of loss probabilities and their implications, rather than the maximum outcomes in a context where probability differences are considered negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences in probabilities are considered negligible. The individual's focus on loss probabilities and their comparative analysis suggests a different decision-making criterion than the one outlined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and the maximum outcomes. Given Lottery A and Lottery B, the information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities (0.2% for A and 0.1% for B) and the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A and -6000 Euros for B). Since these probabilities are very low and could be considered negligible in difference, and the maximum outcomes are -3000 Euros and -6000 Euros, the decision reason can be applied. The key information for the decision reason is that the probabilities are low and the maximum outcome of Lottery A is more favorable (less negative) than that of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, noted the possible loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, and acknowledged that the probabilities of losses are very low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential loss is half that of Lottery B, despite both losses having small probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the negligible difference in probabilities and the preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual considered the low probabilities and the difference in maximum outcomes (losses), which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are considered negligible. The individual preferred Lottery A because it has a less severe loss, which can be seen as the more favorable maximum outcome given the context of the decision.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason's criteria, focusing on the maximum outcomes when the probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it offers a less severe loss (more favorable outcome in the context of losses) matches the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 1000 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 500 Euros. The probabilities are 50% for the maximum outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the guaranteed outcome in Lottery B. However, according to the decision reason, the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 1000 Euros for Lottery A and 500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries offer the same expected value, and they noted the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B. They also acknowledged the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A and compared the magnitudes of the possible gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B because they were deterred by the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A, despite recognizing that both lotteries have outcomes of similar magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (1000 Euros for Lottery A and 500 Euros for Lottery B) when probability differences are considered negligible. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the security of the gain and the risk of winning nothing, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes as the primary reason for their choice.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are deemed negligible. In contrast, the individual preferred Lottery B due to its secure gain, indicating that the individual did not prioritize the maximum outcome as the decision reason would.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, whereas the individual prioritized the security of the gain and the avoidance of the risk of winning nothing. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of avoiding loss is 0 Euros with 50% probability, but the actual maximum loss is -1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the consideration of probability differences as negligible. Since both lotteries have outcomes and probabilities that can be compared, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, noting they are equal. They also considered the nature of the loss in each lottery, with Lottery A offering a certain loss of 500 Euros and Lottery B offering a 50% chance of no loss. The individual mentions the losses in both lotteries are in a similar order of magnitude but focuses on the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a possibility of not losing anything, despite acknowledging the expected values of both lotteries are equal. The justification is based on the potential to avoid loss entirely, which seems to align with preferring a more favorable maximum outcome (in this case, not losing anything).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences. The individual considered the nature of the outcomes (certain loss vs. chance of no loss) and the expected values but did not explicitly discuss the probabilities as being negligible. However, their focus on the possibility of not losing with Lottery B suggests they valued the more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros) over the certain loss of Lottery A.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual preferred Lottery B for its chance of no loss, which can be seen as the more favorable maximum outcome in this context. However, the individual's reasoning also heavily involves the concept of expected values being equal and the psychological aspect of avoiding loss, which is not directly addressed by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (focusing on the more favorable outcome of not losing anything), but it also incorporates additional considerations (expected values, psychological aspect of loss) not explicitly part of the decision reason. The individual does not explicitly state that the probability differences are negligible, which is a key component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while there are some similarities between the decision reason and the individual's justification, the individual's process includes factors not directly related to the decision reason, and they do not explicitly address the negligibility of probability differences as required by the decision reason. Therefore, it's somewhat uncertain but leans towards the decision reason not being the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros. The probabilities of the maximum outcomes are 25% for both lotteries. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A and 4000 Euros for B) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes (25% for both).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery A offers a chance at a high gain, and Lottery B offers twice the chance at a similarly high or distinctly lower gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it offers twice the chance of a gain compared to Lottery A, and the possible gain amounts are in the same order of magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considers the expected values, the chances of high gains, and the order of magnitude of the gains. While there is some overlap in considering the outcomes, the individual's focus is more on the expected value and the comparative chances of gains rather than solely on the maximum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers twice the chance of a gain, not directly because of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not directly align with preferring the lottery based solely on the maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the maximum outcome when the probability differences are negligible. The individual's focus on expected value, comparative chances of gains, and the order of magnitude of gains indicates a different decision-making rationale than the one specified by the decision reason."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, both lotteries have outcomes with 25% probability, and the remaining probabilities are also comparable (75% for Lottery A and 50% + 25% for Lottery B). The maximum outcome for both lotteries in terms of loss is -6000 Euros for Lottery A and -4000 Euros for Lottery B. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, it can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same. They also considered the probability of loss and the size of the losses in both lotteries, noting that while the probability of a loss is higher in Lottery B, the losses are smaller. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher probability of a loss, the losses are smaller compared to the maximum loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probabilities are negligible. The individual considered the size of the losses (maximum outcomes) and the probabilities but made their decision based on the smaller losses in Lottery B rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes as the primary factor. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligible. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the smaller size of losses in Lottery B as the reason for their choice, rather than directly stating a preference for the lottery with the more favorable (less negative) maximum outcome due to negligible probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. Instead, the individual focused on the comparative sizes of potential losses and the expected value, indicating that while there are some similarities, the decision reason as stated was not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability. Although the probability difference is significant (100% vs 0.1%), the decision reason's rule can still be applied by acknowledging that the difference is not negligible. However, to follow the reason's criteria, we must note that the maximum outcome of Lottery B (5000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (5 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, noted the low probability of winning in Lottery B, and recognized the guaranteed small win in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a small but certain win, considering that only one round is relevant. The individual implicitly weighs the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A over the potential but highly uncertain outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the win in Lottery A and the low probability of winning in Lottery B, which indirectly touches upon the decision reason's focus on probabilities and outcomes. However, the individual's main consideration was the certainty of the win rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible, which would suggest preferring Lottery B for its higher maximum outcome. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the certainty of its outcome, not directly because it had a more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, especially since the probability difference was explicitly considered significant by the individual (""ein Gewinn sehr unwahrscheinlich""), implying that the individual did not treat the probability differences as negligible.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5000 Euros with a very low probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with 100% probability. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, we can apply this reason to compare the two lotteries based on their maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, noted the certain but small loss of Lottery B, and recognized the very low probability of a high loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the potential loss in Lottery A is much higher than the certain loss in Lottery B, despite the low probability of the former.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, focused on the expected value and the magnitude of potential losses rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes based on negligible probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligible. The individual, however, chose based on the comparison of potential losses and their probabilities, not directly applying the rule of preferring the more favorable maximum outcome due to negligible probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual based their choice on the comparison of potential losses and their probabilities, and the expected value of the lotteries, rather than focusing solely on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, there's a 100% chance of gaining 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, there's a 50% chance of gaining 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (3000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros). However, the probabilities of the two lotteries are significantly different, especially since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive outcome, which might not be considered negligible. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries and the probabilities associated with these outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain offered by Lottery A, the chance of doubling the amount with Lottery B, and the equal chance of a high loss with Lottery B. They also mentioned the expected value of Lottery B being lower.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by mentioning the secure gain it offers, the balanced risk and reward of Lottery B (which implies considering both the potential gain and loss), and the lower expected value of Lottery B. The deliberation process described focuses on the security of the gain, the risk associated with Lottery B, and the expected value comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the outcomes but also heavily weighted the security of the gain and the expected value, indicating that probability differences were not considered negligible.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome under certain conditions. The individual, however, chose based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not solely on the maximum possible outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process seems to have been influenced more by the security of the gain and the expected value of the lotteries rather than solely by the maximum possible outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The decision reason provided does not fully align with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A, which was based on the secure gain and the lower expected value of Lottery B, rather than a preference for the maximum outcome under conditions of negligible probability differences.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros, while Lottery B offers a guaranteed 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros for Lottery A and 2000 Euros for Lottery B) and the fact that the difference in probabilities (50% vs 100%) might be considered significant, not negligible. However, for the sake of analysis, we'll proceed with understanding that the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are deemed negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery B, the comparison of expected values between the two lotteries, and the risk of a high loss in Lottery A versus the chance of a higher gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure win and has a higher expected value compared to Lottery A, despite Lottery A offering a chance at a higher gain, this chance is offset by an equal chance of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when the probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's consideration includes the expected value and the security of the win, which suggests they did not solely focus on the maximum outcomes or consider the probability differences as negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences were considered negligible. However, the individual chose Lottery B, emphasizing its guaranteed nature and higher expected value, not solely the maximum possible outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's choice was based on the security of the win and the comparison of expected values, indicating they did not use the specified decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros, and Lottery B offers a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros for Lottery B and 1000 Euros for Lottery A) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, and given that one lottery has a fixed outcome while the other has variable outcomes with equal probabilities, we can derive that the reason could potentially apply by comparing the maximum possible gains (3000 Euros for B vs. 1000 Euros for A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries (1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B), the possibility of achieving a higher gain with Lottery B, and the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain of 1000 Euros, weighing the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B against the equal risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probabilities are deemed negligible. The individual, however, considered not just the maximum outcomes but also the expected values and the risks associated with each lottery, indicating a broader consideration than just the maximum possible gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing Lottery B because it offers a higher maximum outcome if the probability differences are considered negligible. However, the individual chose Lottery A, emphasizing the security of the gain over the potential for a higher but riskier reward. This suggests that the individual did not solely prioritize the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome as the decision reason would dictate.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, indicates a consideration of expected values, risk, and the security of the gain, which goes beyond the simple maximization of the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The decision reason provided does not align with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B, suggesting that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries. Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 6000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same. They also considered the potential for high gain and high loss in Lottery B, as well as the fact that Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the high potential loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with the information considered by the individual (expected values, potential gains and losses, and their probabilities). The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes, ignoring probabilities unless they are negligible, and prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the potential loss and its probability, rather than solely focusing on the maximum outcomes. The individual's decision to choose Lottery A because of the risk of a high loss in Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.
