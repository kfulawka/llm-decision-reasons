STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries, as stated in the report. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on selecting the lottery with a 100% chance of winning, which implies a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the mean of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (amounts and probabilities, focusing on the certainty of the outcome), it appears the individual did not specifically consider the mean of the outcomes as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a 100% chance of winning), it's clear the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the likelihood of achieving a gain. The described deliberation process focuses on the probabilities of winning rather than the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning), the two rules do not align. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their counts.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain, implying they prioritized certainty over potential higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their counts) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities): The individual considered probabilities in addition to outcomes, which is not a part of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated without considering probabilities) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the certainty of a win): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since it focuses on certainty rather than the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason was not used by the individual because the verbal report indicates the decision was based on the certainty of a win, not the mean outcome of the lotteries as defined by the decision reason. The consideration of probabilities by the individual further deviates from the decision reason's methodology, which ignores probabilities."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the amounts they could win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potential for the higher win amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the amounts they could win): The individual considered the win amounts, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason, but the decision reason specifically involves calculating a mean, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the lottery with the potential for the higher win amount): The individual's justification is based on the potential highest win, not explicitly on the mean outcome, but it indirectly aligns because the lottery with the higher potential win (Lottery A) also has the higher mean outcome according to the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the higher win amount could be interpreted as aligning with the decision reason's preference for the higher mean outcome, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating means or considering both outcomes equally as the decision reason does. Thus, while there's a possible alignment in the choice made, the process described doesn't perfectly match the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1500 Euros), according to this decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts (Beträge) and probabilities (Wahrscheinlichkeiten) of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is more probable (ein Gewinn wahrscheinlicher ist). This implies the individual focused on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (amounts and probabilities), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (prefer the lottery with the higher probability of winning), the two rules are not aligned. The decision reason suggests choosing Lottery A based on its higher mean outcome, but the individual’s justification suggests choosing Lottery B because it has a higher probability of winning.

The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on selecting the lottery that promises the higher gain because the probability of winning in both lotteries is similarly low. This indicates the individual focused on the potential gain and the similarity in low winning probabilities between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it appears the individual did consider the outcomes but not necessarily in the context of calculating a mean as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with the higher gain due to similarly low probabilities), there is a partial alignment in that both involve comparing outcomes, but the individual's reasoning does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report suggests an emphasis on the higher potential gain and the low probability of winning in both lotteries, which aligns somewhat with the decision reason's preference for higher outcomes but does not directly indicate the use of mean calculations as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason, there is no clear indication that the mean outcome calculation was used to make the decision. The focus on the higher gain and similar low probabilities of winning suggests a different rationale than the one specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-2000 Euros is actually lower, indicating a mistake in the initial comparison), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A based on its calculation method, but given the mistake, let's correct this: Lottery B has a higher mean outcome according to the decision reason's flawed calculation method because -3000 is indeed less negative than -2000 when considering the absolute loss, but the correct interpretation should be based on the calculation provided. The decision reason actually prefers the lottery with the ""higher"" mean outcome, which would be a misunderstanding since both are negative. The correct application should consider which loss is less severe in the context of the decision reason, but the provided method suggests a direct comparison of means without considering the direction of the outcomes (gains or losses). Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived, but its application seems to misunderstand the nature of losses.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on selecting the lottery that has a possibility of not incurring a loss and did not find the difference between 3000 and 4000 Euros in losses to be significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of lotteries based on a simple arithmetic mean of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities, with a focus on avoiding loss), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual focuses on the aspect of avoiding loss and the difference in loss amounts, not directly on the mean outcomes as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (avoiding loss and considering the difference in loss amounts insignificant), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's reasoning is more aligned with risk aversion or a consideration of potential losses rather than a straightforward comparison of mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more probable to not incur a loss. This implies the individual focused on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than directly comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities): While the individual did consider the outcomes, they also heavily focused on the probabilities, especially the probability of not incurring a loss, which is not directly relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (chose based on the probability of not incurring a loss): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason ignores probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as described, since their justification for the choice was based on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, but focusing on avoiding loss), there is a partial match since the individual did consider the outcomes but not in the context of calculating a mean independent of probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference based on mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preference based on probability of not incurring a loss), there is no direct match. The decision reason's focus is on the mean outcome calculated in a specific way, while the individual's focus is on avoiding losses based on probability.

The decision reason specifically calculates a mean outcome based on all possible outcomes of the lotteries, independent of their probabilities, and makes a decision based on this calculation. The verbal report, however, indicates that the individual's decision was based on the probability of avoiding a loss, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes in the manner specified by the decision reason.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because -1500 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains (or outcomes) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where the probability of not incurring a loss is higher. This implies the individual focused on avoiding losses and considered the probability of the zero outcome (no loss) in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which does not directly involve comparing probabilities of specific outcomes like avoiding a loss. The individual, however, considered probabilities and outcomes but specifically in the context of avoiding losses, not calculating mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, while the individual preferred the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss. These are distinct decision-making criteria.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make the decision. The individual's focus was on minimizing loss rather than maximizing the mean outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (500)/1 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (1000 + 0)/2 = 500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 500 Euros when calculated in this manner.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. Second, the justification for the choice is based on selecting the lottery where a win definitely occurs, implying a focus on certainty rather than the calculated mean of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts, with a focus on certainty), there's a discrepancy. The decision reason specifically looks at the mean of all outcomes without considering probabilities, while the individual's focus was on the certainty of a win, which aligns more with the probability aspect than the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason. Furthermore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not match the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a definite win), as the individual's choice is based on avoiding risk rather than comparing mean outcomes.

For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros, and since there's only one outcome, the mean is -500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but in this case, both lotteries have the same mean outcome of -500 Euros when calculated according to the decision reason's rule.

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. However, to calculate the mean as per the decision reason, we need to consider all distinct outcomes and their count. For Lottery A, the calculation would involve (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3, since there are three distinct outcomes. For Lottery B, it would be (6000 + 0) / 2, since there are two distinct outcomes. The mean for Lottery A is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B due to its higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities and chose the lottery with more events promising a gain despite equal probabilities of gaining compared to the other lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the number of events promising a gain and the comparison of probabilities of gaining between the two lotteries.

For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. We can calculate the mean for each lottery:
- Lottery B: (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros
- Lottery A: (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for the choice was that they chose the lottery where a win is certain. The individual focused on the certainty of the win rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts, with a focus on certainty of win), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with a certain win), the two do not align. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculated mean of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. Since Lottery A has a higher mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was to select the lottery where a win is expected with certainty. This implies the individual focused on the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), we see the individual considered more than just the outcomes, including probabilities, which is not directly aligned with the decision reason's focus solely on outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated without considering probabilities) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with a guaranteed win), we observe that the individual's justification does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. The individual's focus was on certainty rather than comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, focused on the certainty of a win rather than calculating and comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries based on their outcomes alone, which is what the decision reason prescribes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000) / 1 = 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would achieve a certain gain, implying they prioritized avoiding loss or ensuring a positive outcome over other considerations.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered outcomes and probabilities but emphasized achieving a certain gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is about ensuring a gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but doesn't directly mention comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on ensuring a certain gain aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes as the basis for the decision. This suggests that while the choice aligns with the decision reason, the thought process described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment in the final choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (0) / 1 = 0. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 6000, -6000, and 0. The mean outcomes for both lotteries are equal, which means the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is to select the lottery that seems safe and does not lead to a loss. The individual focused on avoiding a loss, which implies considering the potential negative outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it seems the individual considered more than just the mean, as they also thought about the safety and potential loss, which is not directly related to calculating the mean outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (select the safe option to avoid loss), it appears that the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, especially since the decision reason would be indifferent due to equal mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on safety and avoiding loss, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal mean outcomes, but the individual's justification is based on a different criterion (avoiding loss), indicating that the decision reason was not used."
