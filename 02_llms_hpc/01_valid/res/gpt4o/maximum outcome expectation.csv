maximum outcome expectation
"STEPS:
1. Begin by identifying the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery:
   - Lottery A: The maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
   - Lottery B: The maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.

2. Calculate the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities for each lottery:
   - Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 33% = 2500 * 0.33 = 825 Euros
   - Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 100% = 2400 * 1 = 2400 Euros

3. Compare the products to determine preference:
   - Lottery A: 825 Euros
   - Lottery B: 2400 Euros 
   - Since 2400 Euros (Lottery B) > 825 Euros (Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess applicability:
   - The decision reason requires us to consider the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - For Lottery A: the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
   - For Lottery B: the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 34%.
   - We can directly obtain the required information from the provided outcomes and probabilities.

2. Compute the relevant products:
   - Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 0.33 = 825 Euros
   - Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 0.34 = 816 Euros

3. Compare the products:
   - The product for Lottery A (825 Euros) is higher than the product for Lottery B (816 Euros).

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - For Lottery A:
     - Maximum outcome: 4000 Euros
     - Probability of maximum outcome: 80%
     - Product of maximum outcome and its probability: 4000 * 0.80 = 3200
   - For Lottery B:
     - Maximum outcome: 3000 Euros
     - Probability of maximum outcome: 100%
     - Product of maximum outcome and its probability: 3000 * 1.00 = 3000
   - The relevant information (product of the maximum outcome and its probability) for both lotteries can be derived from the decision problem. Hence, the decision reason can be applied strictly.
   
2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Compare the products:
     - Lottery A: 3200
     - Lottery B: 3000
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery with the higher product is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Calculate the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for Lottery A: 
   - Lottery A: 4000 Euros * 20% = 4000 * 0.20 = 800

2. Calculate the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for Lottery B: 
   - Lottery B: 3000 Euros * 25% = 3000 * 0.25 = 750

3. Compare the products derived in Step 1 and Step 2:
   - Lottery A has a product of 800
   - Lottery B has a product of 750 

4. Since 800 (Lottery A) > 750 (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem: 
   - The decision reason requires the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - Relevant information for Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 6000 Euros, Probability of maximum outcome = 45%.
   - Relevant information for Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 3000 Euros, Probability of maximum outcome = 90%.

2. Calculate the products:
   - For Lottery A: Product = 6000 Euros * 0.45 = 2700 Euros.
   - For Lottery B: Product = 3000 Euros * 0.90 = 2700 Euros.

3. Compare the products:
   - The product of the maximum outcome and its probability for Lottery A is 2700 Euros.
   - The product of the maximum outcome and its probability for Lottery B is 2700 Euros.
