STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (since there is only one probability value). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with each lottery and the difference between the potential gains (2400 Euros vs. 2500 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it was risk-free and guaranteed a win, and the difference between 2400 Euros and 2500 Euros was not significant enough to take on risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the risk and the difference between potential gains.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its risk-free nature and the insignificant difference between the potential gains, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (both prefer Lottery B), but the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's rule. The individual focuses on risk and the value of potential gains rather than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was directly used in the decision-making process. The individual's justification is more closely related to risk aversion and the perceived value of the outcomes rather than the specific rule about probability differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, so the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 34% = 32%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums to be won and the highest possible probability of a win. They mention that the sums to be won did not have a big difference in their opinion.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual based their choice on the highest possible probability of a win, which led them to choose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the sums to be won and the highest probability of winning. The individual does not mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but based their decision on the highest possible probability of a win, not the difference between probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the highest probability of winning rather than the difference between the probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of a large sum in Lottery A and the risk involved in Lottery B for a potentially higher amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the guaranteed win in Lottery A made it not worth taking the risk in Lottery B for a possibly higher amount, indicating a focus on the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, while the individual considered the guarantee and the risk, which indirectly relates to the probability differences but does not directly mention comparing probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (difference of 0%). The individual's justification aligns with preferring Lottery A due to its guarantee, which can be seen as a consequence of having no probability difference, but the justification does not explicitly mention the comparison of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's focus on the guarantee and risk indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smaller probability difference, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing probability differences. Therefore, while there's a plausible connection, it's not a direct match, leading to an assessment that leans towards the use of the decision reason but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (winning) and 75% (not winning), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% (winning) and 80% (not winning), also resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information here is the probability differences for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning a relatively high sum in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, noting that while the potential win in Lottery B is higher, the risk does not seem worth it to them. They mention the percentage probability of winning a higher sum in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparative probabilities of winning and the perceived risk associated with each lottery, indicating a preference for the lottery with a ""relatively higher"" probability of winning a significant amount, even if that amount is not the highest possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual discusses the comparative probabilities of winning but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, seems to prioritize the comparative probabilities of winning a significant amount, not explicitly the difference between the probabilities of winning and not winning in each lottery.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the comparative probabilities of winning and the associated risk rather than the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as their verbal report does not directly mention or imply the use of the specific rule about probability differences. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does discuss probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, albeit not in the manner specified by the reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, so the difference is 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, so the difference is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (10%) compared to Lottery A (80%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery A (90% being ""almost 100%"") and perceived the chance in Lottery B as too risky due to its near 50/50 nature.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of winning seemed very likely, and the risk associated with Lottery B's nearly equal chance of winning or losing was too great.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the perceived risk and the high probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its smaller probability difference, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the perceived high likelihood of winning and the risk associated with Lottery B. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which would be Lottery A because 99.6% is less than 99.8%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery and chose the one with the higher chance of winning, aiming to keep the risk low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, indicating a preference for the option perceived as less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the higher probability of winning (which directly relates to the maximum probability in this context) and the desire to minimize risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities, which aligns with choosing Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is based on the higher probability of winning and minimizing risk, not explicitly on the difference between the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the higher probability of winning and risk minimization does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities. While both lead to preferring Lottery A, the reasoning processes differ. The individual does not mention considering the range of probabilities or the specific difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the basis for their decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possibility of not incurring losses with Lottery B (20% chance of 0 Euros) and compares the potential losses between the two lotteries (-3000 Euros for Lottery A vs. -4000 Euros for Lottery B), indicating they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by mentioning the chance to avoid losses and downplaying the difference between losing 3000 or 4000 Euros, suggesting a focus on the potential for a better outcome rather than the magnitude of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses more on the outcomes and the chance to avoid losses rather than the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it based on the chance to avoid losses and not explicitly on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by preferring the lottery that seemed to have a better outlook in terms of percentages of not making a loss, even though this might mean taking on a risk of potentially higher losses, because the difference in loss amounts between the two lotteries was not seen as very large.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the risk of loss and the comparison of potential loss amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification. The individual's reasoning seems to be more about the perceived risk and the comparison of potential losses rather than the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's decision-making process, as described, focuses on different aspects of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to have considered the potential losses and the probabilities associated with each lottery, albeit not accurately representing the probabilities of Lottery B as 50/50, which does not match the given probabilities. However, the focus was on the potential loss and the perceived risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found the decision difficult but decided to ""setzen auf mein Glück"" (bet on my luck), indicating a preference for the gamble over the more certain loss, rationalizing that the difference between losing 3000 Euros and 6000 Euros was not significant since either way, they felt they would have ""lost.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused more on the potential losses and a misperceived probability of the second lottery, not explicitly discussing the difference in probabilities as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 10% difference. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention considering the probability differences but rather the perceived risk and the gamble's appeal due to the potential for not losing anything.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the probability differences as the basis for the decision.

Ich habe gehofft, dass Lotterie B ein besseres Angebot aufweist. Als ich gesehen habe, dass es weniger Verlüste geben würde, blieb ich aufmerksam und sah mir die Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür an.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (for the -6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (for the -3000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the large amount of money in Lottery A and its very low probability, which made them hesitant. They then looked at Lottery B, noticing it had fewer losses and a similar probability to Lottery A. The individual focused on the potential losses and the probabilities associated with each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offered fewer losses (a maximum loss of 3000 Euros compared to 6000 Euros in Lottery A) and they perceived the probabilities of winning as practically the same. The individual's decision was based on minimizing potential losses and considering the probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual did consider probabilities, their focus was more on the absolute amounts of potential losses and the similarity in probabilities rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, was based on minimizing losses and perceiving similar probabilities, not explicitly on comparing the range of probabilities within each lottery.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Their decision was more intuitively based on the magnitude of potential losses and the perceived similarity in probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a 0% difference, and Lottery B has a 50% difference. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A (500 Euros) versus the risk of getting either 1000 Euros or 0 Euros with Lottery B. They mention the risk of ending up with 0 Euros and find the 50/50 risk too high.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that practically getting 500 Euros guaranteed is more worthwhile than taking a risk that could result in getting nothing (0 Euros), indicating they are risk-averse in this context.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges (0% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B), while the individual focuses on the risk of getting nothing versus a guaranteed amount. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery A), and the individual chooses Lottery A but justifies it based on risk aversion rather than explicitly discussing probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes, but considering the effective range it's between 0% and 50% for the concept of minimum to maximum probability difference). However, more accurately, Lottery A has outcomes with probabilities of 50% each, so the range is between the probabilities of its outcomes, which is 0% difference in the probabilities of its two outcomes since both are 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100%, since there's only one outcome. Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 0% (since both outcomes have the same probability) and for Lottery B is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences within each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered their luck and the 50/50 chance of not having losses as a good opportunity. They also mentioned that the difference between losing 500 Euros or 1000 Euros does not make a big difference to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on their attitude towards risk (considering luck and the possibility of no loss) and their perception of the losses (not much difference between 500 and 1000 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of luck, the 50/50 chance, and the perceived difference in losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability does not appear to be reflected in the individual's justification, which is more about their risk attitude and perception of loss rather than the probabilistic differences within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. Instead, their focus was on the perceived risk and the potential losses, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and the amounts that could be won in both lotteries. They were initially hesitant due to the complexity of Lottery A but found the numbers to be simple and reassuring. They noted the 25% chance of winning a relatively high sum in Lottery A and the lack of a high loss risk. For Lottery B, they were excited about the 25% chance of winning a large sum but then considered the equal probability of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it had multiple ""Gewinn-Optionen"" (winning options), hoping to achieve at least one of the possible wins, even though the sums were lower than in Lottery B. They later realized they had made a thinking error, as the probability of winning in Lottery A was not greater than in Lottery B, but rather the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused more on the presence of multiple winning options in Lottery A and the potential for a high win in Lottery B, without explicitly discussing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, was based on the number of winning options and the potential for achieving at least one win, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which was not a factor mentioned in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the presence of multiple winning options in Lottery A and the hope of achieving at least one of these wins, indicating that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (for the 5000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 5 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by stating that the probability of winning in Lottery A was too low, making the guaranteed amount in Lottery B more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of Lottery B, not directly on the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (since 0% difference is smaller than 99.8% difference). The individual's justification, while leading to the selection of Lottery B, does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of the range of probabilities as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The justification provided focuses on the perceived low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of Lottery B, rather than the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% for one outcome, so the difference is 0% (since there's only one outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 5000 Euros in Lottery A, even with a very small probability, and compared it to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B. They seemed to focus on the potential loss and their personal valuation of risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even with a small probability, was not worth the risk when compared to a smaller, certain loss of 5 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration was more about the magnitude of potential losses and their personal risk tolerance rather than the probability differences themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived value of potential losses rather than the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus was more on the perceived risk and value of potential losses rather than on the probability ranges of the lotteries.

Task description —
Your task is to assess, based on the verbal report, whether the individual used the reason to make the decision. 
Conduct the assessment step-by-step. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
Evaluate whether the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities and summarize this information. 
Proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
Focus on the described deliberation process and ignore information about the individual’s final choice. 
Proceed to Step 3. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
Based on these two comparisons, assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision. 
Indicate your final assessment on a scale between 0 and 100. 
Interpret the endpoints and the midpoint in the following way:
    - 0: Certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual.
    - 50: Uncetrain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual.
    - 100: Certain that the decision reason was used by the individual.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as: both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a loss in Lottery B and the 100% chance of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found the risk of loss in Lottery B unattractive, implying that the certainty of a gain in Lottery A was more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual's consideration was about the risk of loss and the certainty of gain, not explicitly about probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery A over the risk in Lottery B, not directly related to the probability difference rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the appeal of a certain gain versus the risk of a loss, rather than the specific rule about probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
18,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for both outcomes) and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, there's no lower probability outcome to consider) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery A, the potential gain, and the fact that the gain and loss in Lottery A are equally probable. They also considered the certainty of gaining a significant amount in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offered a certain gain, which they perceived as a better option than risking a significant loss in Lottery A, despite the potential for a higher gain. The certainty of the outcome in Lottery B was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's deliberation, as described, does not explicitly mention comparing these probability differences as a factor in their decision. They focus more on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the risk of loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the certainty of the gain as their primary reason, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of the gain and the risk of loss, without mentioning the probability differences as a deciding factor. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the decision reason is about comparing these differences to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference, and both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived, but it leads to indifference according to the decision reason's rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B, alongside the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it guaranteed a win, and the risk of loss in Lottery B was not worth the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same difference in probabilities (0%), but the individual preferred Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome, not because of the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason based on the probability differences to make the decision. The individual's justification was more aligned with risk aversion and the guarantee of a positive outcome rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

eine 50%ige chance so einen großen verlust zu machen lohnt sich einfach für mich nichtdieses risiko würde ich auch für so eine große summe nicht eingehen

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between them based on this criterion. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability distribution of each lottery, which is available.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a significant loss (a ""großen verlust"") with a 50% chance, indicating they focused on the potential downside of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that a 50% chance of making a large loss is not worth it for them, even for a large sum, implying they are risk-averse regarding significant losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the risk of a large loss, not on comparing probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (avoiding a significant loss due to its probability). Since both lotteries have the same difference in probabilities (0%), the decision reason would not differentiate between them, but the individual clearly preferred one over the other based on risk aversion, not the probability difference.
