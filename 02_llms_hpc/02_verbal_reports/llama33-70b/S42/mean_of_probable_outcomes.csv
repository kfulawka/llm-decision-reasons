STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. The probable outcomes for Lottery A are 2400 Euros with 66% probability. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is probable since 100% is greater than 1/1 or 100%. The probable outcome for Lottery B is 2400 Euros with 100% probability. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 2400 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 2400 Euros. However, considering the instruction, we also note the 2500 Euros outcome in Lottery A has a probability of 33%, which is exactly on the threshold but does not exceed it, thus it's not considered probable under the given definition. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the average of probable outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of getting more money (33% chance of getting 2500 Euros), the rarity of the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery A, and compares the probabilities of winning in both lotteries, noting a 99% chance of winning something in Lottery A versus a 100% chance in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides on Lottery A due to the small discrepancy in probabilities between the two lotteries and the potential for a higher gain, despite acknowledging the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on the definition provided, would only consider the 2400 Euros outcome for Lottery A. The individual, however, seems to consider the potential for higher gain (2500 Euros) and the comparison of overall winning probabilities, not strictly the average of probable outcomes as defined.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual’s justification, however, is based on the potential for a higher gain and the perceived small risk, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report indicates consideration of potential gains, risk, and overall probabilities rather than the specific calculation of probable outcomes' averages. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Therefore, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. However, according to the decision reason, we should consider the probable outcomes to decide, but since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to see how the individual's reasoning aligns with this analysis.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries and the difference in the amounts that could be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher amount because, given similar probabilities, they wanted the chance to win more.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have 0 Euros as the probable outcome. The individual, however, focused on the similarity in probabilities and the difference in potential winnings, not explicitly on the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule would not lead to a clear preference between the two lotteries based on the probable outcomes, as both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring the higher potential win when probabilities are similar, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries in this scenario, while the individual's choice is based on preferring the higher potential win given similar probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is always probable since 1/1 = 1. Thus, for Lottery A, the 4000 Euros outcome with 80% probability is probable, and the 0 Euros outcome with 20% probability is not. For Lottery B, the 3000 Euros outcome with 100% probability is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (4000 * 0.8) / 1 = 3200 Euros (considering only the probable outcome), and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference between the risky 4000 Euros and the safe 3000 Euros and decided that this difference is relatively small, implying they weighed the potential gain against the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the safe option (Lottery B) because they would rather have the certain, albeit smaller, amount of money than risk getting 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating or considering the probable outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the difference between the potential outcomes and the certainty of one of the options, not explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on preferring certainty over risk due to the relatively small difference between the potential outcomes, not explicitly on comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the specific decision reason provided, which involves calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the defined probability threshold. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome and the relative difference between the potential gains, rather than on the specific rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason."
4,"probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, there are two outcomes: 3000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability. For Lottery B, there are also two outcomes: 4000 Euros with a 20% probability and 0 Euros with an 80% probability. The decision reason categorizes an outcome as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. Since both lotteries have 2 outcomes, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 50% (1/2). For Lottery A, only the 0 Euros outcome (75% probability) meets this criterion. For Lottery B, only the 0 Euros outcome (80% probability) meets this criterion. The decision reason then calculates the average of these probable outcomes for each lottery. For both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros, as only the 0 Euros outcome in each lottery has a probability higher than 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the ""höheren Gewinn"" (higher gain) and ""niedrigere Chance"" (lower chance), suggesting they looked at the monetary outcomes and their probabilities. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose the lottery with the ""höheren Gewinn"" and ""niedrigere Chance"" because, relatively speaking, the probabilities of the two lotteries do not differ much. This implies the individual was weighing the potential gains against the probabilities of those gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes (outcomes with probabilities > 50%), which, in this case, led to both lotteries having an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual, however, seems to have focused on the higher gain and the relative similarity in probabilities, not specifically on outcomes with probabilities greater than 50%. Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on higher gain and lower chance due to similar probabilities). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would not differentiate between the lotteries based on the provided probabilities and outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages. The decision reason's specific criteria (outcomes with probabilities > 50%) and the resulting indifference between the two lotteries (since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros) are not reflected in the individual's justification, which emphasizes the higher gain and the relative similarity in probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Thus, only the 3000 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. 
For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).
For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 3000 Euros (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is probable).
Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its average of probable outcomes (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning a high amount in Lottery B and compared it with the probability of winning in Lottery A, noting that the chance of winning a higher amount in Lottery B, although not the highest probability, was ""relativ hoch genug"" (relatively high enough) to take the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of winning the high amount was ""relativ hoch"" (relatively high), and this was enough to take the risk for the higher amount, despite acknowledging the high probability of winning a smaller amount in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, where an outcome is probable if its probability exceeds 50%. The individual, however, discusses the relative heights of probabilities without explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes based on the 50% threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would lead to choosing Lottery A. The individual, however, chose Lottery B based on the perceived sufficiency of the probability of winning the higher amount, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason’s rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the given probability threshold.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euro outcomes are probable for both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros, as the non-probable outcomes (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B) are not considered in the calculation.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the chance of winning money in both lotteries is very low, implying they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because, in the exceptional case of winning, it offers a higher amount of money than Lottery B, and they perceive they have relatively little to lose.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes (those with a probability > 0.5), which in this case are the 0 Euro outcomes for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the potential for higher gain in the unlikely event of winning, rather than the probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since the average of probable outcomes (0 Euros) is the same for both. The individual, however, chooses Lottery A based on the potential for a higher payout in the unlikely event of winning, not because of the probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would lead to indifference based on the probable outcomes, while the individual chooses based on the potential higher payout of the less probable outcome. This indicates the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery. An outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.

Verbal report:
Ich würde A wählen, da mir die 80% Wahrscheinlichkeit, die vergleichsweise hoch ist, ein zu großes Risiko birgt.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there's only 1 outcome, so its outcome is always probable. 
- Lottery B has -4000 Euros with 80% probability (probable) and 0 Euros with 20% probability (not probable).
- Lottery A has -3000 Euros with 100% probability (probable).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (-4000 Euros * 80%) / 100% = -3200 Euros, since only the -4000 Euros outcome is considered probable. For Lottery A, it's -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (80%) of the negative outcome in Lottery B as a significant risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of the negative outcome in Lottery B was perceived as too risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating the average outcome based on probabilities higher than a certain threshold. The individual, however, focused on the high probability of a negative outcome in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the impact of probable outcomes but doesn't directly mention calculating averages or comparing them between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is about avoiding the high-risk option due to its high probability of a negative outcome, which indirectly suggests a consideration of the probable outcomes but doesn't explicitly state a preference based on the average of these outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the high probability of a negative outcome in Lottery B and the decision to avoid it due to perceived risk shows some alignment with considering probable outcomes, a key aspect of the decision reason. However, the verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes between the two lotteries, which is central to the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a slight indication that the individual considered aspects related to the decision reason, it's far from certain that the decision reason was directly applied as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the -4000 Euros outcome has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has an 80% probability, which is greater than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
- For Lottery B, the -3000 Euros outcome has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 75% probability, which is greater than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of Lottery B due to the potential loss being lower in the worst case and compared the probabilities, noting the lower loss amount occurs relatively less often.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the lower potential loss in the worst case and a comparison of probabilities, indicating a consideration of both the magnitude of loss and the frequency of its occurrence.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries, suggesting indifference based on the reason alone. However, the individual considered the worst-case scenario and the comparative probabilities of losses, not directly mentioning the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would suggest indifference. The individual, however, preferred Lottery B based on the lower loss in the worst case and a comparison of probabilities, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the magnitude of potential loss and a comparison of probabilities, which does not align with the decision reason that considers the average of probable outcomes. Since the decision reason would lead to indifference (as both lotteries have the same average probable outcome of 0 Euros) and the individual's justification does not reflect this reasoning, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
9,"verlieren ist mit 90% jedoch sehr hoch, bei Lotterie B liegt statistisch gesehen mehr als jeder zweite Ausgang bei 0.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome -3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
For Lottery B, the outcome -6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable. The outcome 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (-3000 Euros * 90%) / 1 = -3000 * 0.9 = -2700 Euros, since only the -3000 Euros outcome is probable. 
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (0 Euros * 55%) / 1 = 0 * 0.55 = 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Based on the calculations, Lottery B has a higher average of probable outcomes (0 Euros) compared to Lottery A (-2700 Euros). Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compares the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries, noting that while the chance of losing money in Lottery B is lower (55%), the probability of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A is very high (90%). The individual also mentions that statistically, more than every second outcome in Lottery B is 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be weighing the risks and probabilities of losing in each lottery, focusing on the high probability of losing a significant amount in Lottery A and the relatively higher chance of avoiding loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, where an outcome is probable if its probability exceeds 50%. The individual discusses probabilities and the comparative risks of losing, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes based on the 50% threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its average being 0 Euros. The individual’s justification seems to lean towards preferring Lottery B due to its lower risk of significant loss, but does not explicitly state a preference based on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's focus on comparative risks and the mention of probabilities suggests some alignment with the considerations of the decision reason. However, the explicit calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason are not clearly mentioned in the verbal report. Thus, while there is some similarity in the considerations, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident, leading to an assessment below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. So, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The probable outcome here is 0 Euros because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 50%.
For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. The probable outcome here is also 0 Euros because its probability (99.8%) is higher than 50%.
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. However, the decision reason's application seems to misunderstand the concept of ""probable outcomes"" as defined, since it does not consider the actual values of the probable losses in its decision-making process but rather focuses on the presence of a probable outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of losing money in both lotteries and the preference for losing 3000 Euros over 6000 Euros if a loss occurs, given nearly the same probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because, although the probability of losing is very low for both, they prefer losing the smaller amount (3000 Euros) if a loss does happen, considering the probabilities of loss are nearly the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, does not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the given probabilities since both have 0 Euros as the probable outcome. The individual, however, focuses on the preference for the smaller loss and the similar probabilities of these losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes does not align with the individual's justification, which is based on preferring a smaller loss at similar probabilities, not on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0 because the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery based on the average of probable outcomes. Instead, the individual's choice is based on a preference for the smaller potential loss at similar probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes (1000 Euros and 0 Euros), so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Since both outcomes have a 50% probability, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (500 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 500 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is that both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes according to this specific reason's criteria.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the discrepancy between possible gain/loss and secure gain, indicating they weighed the risk against the certainty of the outcome. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose the secure 500 Euros because the discrepancy between the possible gain/loss and the secure gain was not high enough to justify taking the risk. This suggests the individual was risk-averse and prioritized certainty over potential higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (average of probable outcomes) with that considered by the individual (discrepancy between possible gain/loss and secure gain, risk aversion), it seems the individual did not directly consider the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus was more on the risk associated with the potential higher gain versus the certainty of a lower gain. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification (choosing the secure option due to risk aversion), the individual's decision aligns with choosing a secure option but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule since the reasoning provided does not mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of comparing the average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus on risk aversion and the discrepancy between potential gain/loss and secure gain does not indicate the use of the decision reason as defined. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but since the outcome chosen (the secure option) could coincidentally align with what the decision reason might suggest in this particular case (where both lotteries have the same average probable outcome), there is a small, but not significant, possibility that elements of the decision reason might have been considered indirectly."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- For Lottery A, both outcomes are probable because both have a 50% probability, which meets the criteria. The average of these probable outcomes is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the only outcome is -500 Euros, which is also probable. Since there's only one outcome, its average is -500 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived and summarized as the average probable outcomes for each lottery: -500 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a 50% chance of ""meinen Betrag gleichzuhalten"" (keeping their amount the same) with Lottery A, implying consideration of the 0 Euro outcome. They also consider the 100% loss of 500 Euros with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that having a 50% chance of not losing (or keeping their amount the same) is preferable to a 100% loss of 500 Euros, indicating that the certainty of loss in Lottery B is a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which is -500 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the presence of a 50% chance of no loss in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B, not explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average (-500 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, prefers Lottery A because of the chance of not losing, which aligns with preferring a lottery based on the consideration of probabilities and outcomes but does not directly apply the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of not losing in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B suggests they considered aspects related to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their implications), but they did not explicitly apply the rule of comparing the averages of these outcomes to make their decision. Thus, while there's some alignment with the general concept of considering probabilities and outcomes, the specific rule of the decision reason (comparing averages of probable outcomes) was not directly applied, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we evaluate whether the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%.

For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros because its probability (75%) is higher than 50%. The outcome of 6000 Euros is not probable since its probability (25%) is lower than 50%.

For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros because its probability (50%) is higher than 33.33%. The outcomes of 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros are not probable individually since their probabilities (25% each) are lower than 33.33%, but together they represent a 50% chance of winning, which is probable.

The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable).
For Lottery B, considering the probable outcome of winning any money (which combines both the 4000 and 2000 Euro outcomes due to their combined probability exceeding the threshold), the calculation of an ""average of probable outcomes"" as per the decision reason is not directly applicable in the traditional sense because the reason focuses on individual outcomes, not combined probabilities of different outcomes. However, interpreting the spirit of the reason, one might consider the average of the winning outcomes (4000 and 2000 Euros) as relevant, which would be (4000 + 2000) / 2 = 3000 Euros. But strictly according to the reason, we should only consider the 0 Euro outcome as probable for both lotteries, making the comparison based on the reason's strict definition challenging.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the general probability of winning money in Lottery B being 50% and notes that while the amounts are smaller, the probability of winning is higher.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify choosing Lottery B based on a higher overall probability of winning money, even though the amounts won are smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the overall probability of winning in Lottery B, which aligns partially with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes. However, the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification focuses on the higher probability of winning in Lottery B, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's reasoning seems to align more with a general preference for a higher chance of winning rather than the specific calculation of averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not strictly follow the decision reason as defined. The individual considers the probability of winning but does not explicitly calculate or compare the average of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while the individual's reasoning touches upon aspects related to the decision reason (such as considering probabilities), it does not closely align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus is more on the general probability of winning rather than the specific calculation of averages of outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold defined by the number of outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 0.33. For Lottery A, there are also 3 outcomes, so the same threshold applies. 
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros because its probability (75%) is higher than the threshold.
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is also 0 Euros because its probability (50%) is higher than the threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of not losing money (receiving 0 Euros) in both lotteries, noting it is higher in Lottery B than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by comparing the probabilities of not losing money in both lotteries, mentioning the higher potential loss in Lottery B but focusing on the higher probability of not losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is the outcome of 0 Euros for both lotteries due to its higher probability. The individual considered the probability of not losing money, which aligns with identifying the probable outcome of 0 Euros in both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the higher probability of not losing money in Lottery B, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but does not directly apply the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of not losing money aligns with identifying probable outcomes, a key aspect of the decision reason. However, the decision reason's core rule about comparing averages of probable outcomes to make a preference is not directly applied in the individual's justification. The individual's reasoning is more about the direct comparison of probabilities of a specific outcome rather than calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes. Thus, while there is some alignment, the decision reason as defined is not clearly used in the decision-making process described in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is always considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 99.9% probability because 99.9% > 0.5. The outcome of 5000 Euros is not probable since 0.1% < 0.5.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 5 Euros is probable since it has a 100% chance.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small chance of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A compared to the guaranteed 5 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the discrepancy between the two potential winnings and the fact that their maximum loss would be 0 Euros, implying they weighed the risk against the potential reward.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by the high discrepancy between the potential winnings of the two lotteries and the fact that the guaranteed win in Lottery B was not high enough to deter them from taking the risk of Lottery A, given their maximum potential loss was 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 5 Euros. The individual considered the potential winnings and the risk, but there's no direct mention of calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes based on the given probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (5 Euros) over Lottery A (0 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not explicitly mention comparing averages of probable outcomes but rather focuses on the potential for a high reward and the minimal risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes based on the given probabilities. The individual's justification emphasizes the potential high reward and the minimal risk rather than comparing the averages of probable outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1, which doesn't apply as all outcomes are probable by definition. The information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying the probable outcomes and calculating their average for each lottery. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 99.9% probability because 99.9% > 0.5. The -5000 Euros outcome is not probable since 0.1% < 0.5. Thus, the average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of -5 Euros is probable (and certain) with 100% probability. Thus, the average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of losing a high amount in Lottery A and acknowledges the certain loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the probability of losing a significant amount in Lottery A being very low and contrasts this with the certainty of loss in Lottery B, without explicitly stating a preference based on the average of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires identifying probable outcomes and their averages. The individual discusses the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly calculate or compare averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing averages of probable outcomes but does discuss the desirability based on the probability and certainty of outcomes.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the average of probable outcomes. However, the report does show an understanding of the probability aspect, which is a component of the decision reason. The individual does not calculate or compare averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason suggests, which is a critical step in the decision reason's rule.

This assessment indicates that while there is some alignment with considering probabilities, the individual does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, which meets this criterion, so both are considered probable. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 = 1. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived: 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 1500 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (3000 + (-3000))/2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the security of winning money with Lottery B, specifically the 100% probability of winning 1500 Euros, and the risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certainty of winning 1500 Euros over the risk of losing money, indicating a preference for security.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 1500 Euros. The individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery B and the risk of losing with Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but does not directly mention calculating averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to a preference for Lottery B, but based on the desire for security and avoiding risk rather than explicitly calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention calculating the average of probable outcomes as per the decision reason, but their preference for Lottery B due to its certainty aligns with the outcome of the decision reason. However, the reasoning process described does not explicitly match the decision reason's criteria, leading to uncertainty about whether the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, which exactly meets this threshold, but according to the definition, it's not higher than 1/2. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 2000 Euros. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is straightforward since there's only one outcome, which is 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, since neither outcome strictly meets the ""probable"" criteria based on the given definition (as neither outcome's probability is strictly higher than 50%), we might interpret the decision reason as not directly applicable in a conventional sense because it doesn't clearly categorize outcomes as probable based on the given probabilities. However, given the context, we can infer the decision reason might be simplified to comparing the certain outcome of Lottery B to the potential gains and losses of Lottery A, focusing on the aspect of certainty versus risk.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""kleine Diskrepanz der Beträge"" (small discrepancy in amounts) and the preference for a ""sichere Variante"" (safe variant), indicating a consideration of the risk associated with Lottery A versus the certainty of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by stating they have more to lose and are happier with a smaller, certain gain than with a comparably low gain and the risk of high loss, highlighting a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, but given the nature of the lotteries, the individual's consideration of risk and certainty aligns with evaluating the outcomes in a manner that prioritizes the certain gain over potential risks, even if not explicitly calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification emphasizes the preference for certainty over risk, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially when considering Lottery B's certain outcome as the basis for comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not directly calculate or mention the ""average of probable outcomes,"" their justification for choosing the certain option over the risky one aligns with the spirit of the decision reason, which prioritizes certain outcomes when they are favorable, as in the case of Lottery B. The individual's focus on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain indicates an alignment with the decision reason's underlying principle of preferring outcomes that are more certain or have a higher average of probable outcomes, even if the specific calculation or terminology is not directly mentioned."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, which exactly meets this threshold, but based on the definition, we might interpret that neither is strictly ""probable"" since neither exceeds 50%. However, for the sake of analysis and considering the context, we'll consider both outcomes as relevant since they exactly meet the threshold and are thus borderline cases. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so any outcome with a probability greater than 0% is considered probable, which applies to the 1000 Euros outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their averages. For Lottery A, the average of its outcomes is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros, considering both outcomes are at the threshold of being probable. For Lottery B, the average is simply 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed amount of Lottery B (1000 Euros) and the 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A, acknowledging the risk but focusing on the potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a 50% chance of winning three times the amount of Lottery B, despite acknowledging the greater risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual, however, seems to focus on the comparison of potential gains rather than calculating or directly comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher gain, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing averages but rather emphasizes the potential upside of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report suggests the individual was swayed by the potential for a higher payout in Lottery A rather than a systematic comparison of probable outcomes' averages. Thus, while the individual considered aspects of the lotteries that could relate to the decision reason, their justification does not clearly indicate the use of the specific rule outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, which meets the criteria. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their calculation of the average. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0. For Lottery B, the average of the probable outcome is 0.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the risk of losing a high amount and the chance of winning, acknowledging that both are equally probable in Lottery A. Second, the individual justifies the choice of Lottery A over Lottery B by mentioning the 50% chance of winning a high amount, despite acknowledging that Lottery B is safer. The individual also mentions not wanting to lose money, which seems to contrast with the choice made.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual does consider the probabilities of winning and losing in Lottery A, which aligns with identifying probable outcomes. However, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes between the two lotteries. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule to the individual's justification, the individual's focus on the probability of winning a high amount in Lottery A somewhat aligns with considering probable outcomes but does not explicitly discuss the average of these outcomes or compare it between the lotteries. The decision reason's specific rule about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes is not directly mentioned or implied in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report shows some alignment with aspects of the decision reason, such as considering probabilities, but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule about calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes. The justification provided focuses more on the presence of risk and the chance of a significant gain rather than the specific calculation or comparison implied by the decision reason. Therefore, while there are hints of related considerations, the report does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined."
