STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the differences in winnings and the risk of losing everything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that the differences in winnings were not large enough to justify the risk of losing everything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (differences in winnings and risk of losing). The individual did not mention considering the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the risk and differences in winnings). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes risk rather than the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the sum of all outcomes for each lottery or preferred the lottery based on this sum, which are key aspects of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
2,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2400 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the sum is 2500 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risks and gains of both lotteries and noted that the probabilities of winning were relatively low for both, but focused on the potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite both lotteries having relatively low probabilities of winning, Lottery B offered a higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, which is related to the ""potential gain"" mentioned by the individual. However, the decision reason ignores probabilities, while the individual mentions considering both gains and the fact that probabilities are ""relatively gering"" (low).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which aligns with the individual's justification of choosing Lottery B for its higher potential gain. However, the decision reason's rule is based on a straightforward comparison of outcome sums without considering probabilities, whereas the individual's justification implicitly considers the interplay between potential gains and their associated probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's focus on the higher potential gain of Lottery B aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher outcome sum. However, the individual also considered the probabilities, which the decision reason does not. This suggests that while the decision reason might have influenced the choice, it was not the sole or possibly even primary basis for the decision, given the individual's broader consideration of both gains and risks. Thus, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with significant uncertainty due to the additional factors considered by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros, so its sum is simply 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. According to the decision reason, we calculate the sum of these outcomes as 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an outcome sum of 3000 Euros and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the certain outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros with 100% probability) and implies consideration of the risk associated with Lottery B, though the specific outcomes and probabilities of Lottery B are not mentioned.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the risk associated with the other option (implied to be Lottery B) is not worth it when there's a 100% chance of winning with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (4000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A), but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention these sums or compare them directly. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the perceived risk of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on risk aversion related to the certainty of the outcome, not the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the sum of outcomes of the lotteries, independent of their probabilities, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. Instead, the individual's choice is driven by the certainty of the outcome and risk aversion, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros, which does not contribute to the sum). For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the relevant information is the total possible winnings from each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of winning and the height of the potential win, comparing the two lotteries in terms of these aspects but seems to misinterpret the probabilities and their differences. They also mention the potential win being 25% higher in one lottery compared to the other, which aligns with a comparison of the outcomes but does not directly relate to the calculation of the sum of outcomes as per the decision reason.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on a comparison of probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention summing the outcomes of each lottery. The mention of probabilities and outcome differences suggests a consideration of how likely and how valuable the winnings are, but it does not directly align with the decision reason’s focus on the total sum of outcomes regardless of probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcome differences). There is a mismatch since the individual does not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes as the decision reason does.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (comparing probabilities and outcome differences). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it involves a comparison that includes probabilities and the percentage increase in the potential win, not the straightforward sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The verbal report does not explicitly mention summing the outcomes of each lottery as the basis for the decision, and the justification provided does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated from the given outcomes, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sums of the outcomes of the two lotteries: 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery B, specifically mentioning a 90% probability, which they perceived as very secure.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its high probability of winning, which made it seem very secure to them. There is no mention of comparing the sums of the outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sums of the outcomes (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), but the individual focused on the probability of winning in Lottery B, not on the sums of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on its high probability, not the sum of its outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning rather than the sum of the outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. Since the sum of the outcomes for Lottery A (6000 Euros) is higher than for Lottery B (3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that winning options were unlikely but noted that the potential gain in Lottery A was higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the higher potential gain of Lottery A compared to Lottery B, despite the low probabilities of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which aligns with the individual considering the higher potential gain of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, and the individual preferred Lottery A because of its higher potential gain, which directly relates to the outcome sum.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's focus on the higher potential gain in Lottery A aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the sums of outcomes between the two lotteries but does highlight the individual's preference for the higher potential gain, which is a key aspect of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification aligns closely with the principle of preferring the higher outcome sum, even though the report does not explicitly state the calculation or comparison of these sums."
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery B since -3000 is greater than -4000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss in Lottery A and compared it with the certain loss in Lottery B, focusing on the probability of losing in Lottery A (20%) and mentioning a ""33% höheres Risiko"" (33% higher risk), which seems to be a misunderstanding or miscalculation because the actual comparison should be between the 20% chance of losing -4000 Euros in Lottery A and the certain loss of -3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it was perceived as less risky or more attractive due to the comparison made, but the calculation provided (""20% von 3000 sind 600EUR"") does not directly relate to the decision reason's criteria (sum of outcomes).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not consider the sum of the outcomes of each lottery as the decision reason requires. Instead, they focused on the probability of loss and a comparative risk assessment.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes. The individual's decision seems to be based on a risk assessment rather than the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, as their justification and consideration were based on a different criterion (risk assessment and probability of loss rather than the sum of outcomes)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery B since -3000 is greater than -4000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in risk (5% higher risk of loss) and the difference in the amount of loss (25% lower loss).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the trade-off between the probability of loss and the magnitude of the loss, mentioning that the risk of a loss was 5% higher but the loss itself was 25% lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of risk and loss magnitude.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) does not match the individual's justification (focusing on the trade-off between risk and loss magnitude).
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating the sum of all outcomes of each lottery to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, and thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""A hatte das geringere Verlustpotenzial,"" which translates to ""A had the lower loss potential."" This indicates the individual considered the potential losses of each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is based on the comparison of the loss potential between the two lotteries, focusing on the lower loss associated with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, while the individual considered the loss potential, which aligns with comparing the negative outcomes but doesn't explicitly mention summing them as the reason does. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative in this context), and the individual chose based on the lower loss potential, which aligns with preferring the less negative outcome sum but doesn't directly state it as a sum.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on loss potential aligns somewhat with the concept of comparing outcomes, but the specific method of summing outcomes as described by the decision reason is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The alignment is partial, suggesting some consideration of outcome comparison, but the exact method of the decision reason is not clearly followed. Thus, the assessment is low but not zero, indicating it's unlikely the decision reason was used as described, but there's a slight connection in the consideration of outcomes."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual is the potential loss associated with each lottery. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is that Lottery A has a smaller potential loss. The described deliberation process focuses on comparing the potential losses of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (potential loss), we see they are related but the individual does not explicitly mention summing the outcomes. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be less negative) to the individual’s justification (preferring the lottery with the smaller potential loss), there is a conceptual alignment since both lead to preferring Lottery A due to its less negative outcome. However, the individual's reasoning is based on the direct comparison of potential losses rather than the sum of all outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the sum of all outcomes as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus on potential loss leads to the same choice as the decision reason but through a different or at least not explicitly stated reasoning process regarding the sum of outcomes. Thus, there is uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used, but there is a notable alignment in the outcome of the decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome sum is 500 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the outcome sum is 1000 Euros + 0 Euros = 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (1000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions wanting to compensate for a previous loss with a ""sicheren Entscheidung,"" which translates to a ""safe decision."" This suggests the individual considered the aspect of safety or certainty in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about making a safe decision to compensate for a previous loss, implying that the choice was motivated by a desire for certainty rather than directly comparing the sums of outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, whereas the individual considered the safety of the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, but the individual's justification emphasizes the safety of the choice, not the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes independent of probabilities. Instead, the focus was on making a safe choice, likely due to the 100% probability of winning 500 Euros in Lottery A.

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -1000 Euros + 0 Euros = -1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of avoiding a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it was the only option to potentially avoid a loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, and both lotteries have the same outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the chance of winning something is higher in Lottery A, which implies they considered the probabilities of non-zero outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the higher chance of winning anything in Lottery A, not directly on the sum of outcomes or their comparison between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about the sum of outcomes, but the individual discusses probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, but the individual justifies their choice based on the higher probability of winning something, not the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus is on the probability of winning rather than the sum of the outcomes of the lotteries, which is what the decision reason is based on.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + (-2000) + 0 = -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The report mentions ""B bot die größere Chancen einen Verlust zu umgehen,"" which translates to ""B has a greater chance of avoiding a loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss in their decision-making process.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's focus on avoiding a loss suggests their justification is based on the probability of not incurring a loss rather than the sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of all outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probability of avoiding a loss), we see they do not align. The decision reason focuses on the total sum of outcomes, while the individual focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (avoiding a loss), it's clear the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would lead to indifference due to equal outcome sums, but the individual's justification is based on a different criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 5000 Euros (since the 0 Euros outcome does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum (5000 Euros vs. 5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of 5 Euros from Lottery B as not worthwhile and viewed the higher risk in Lottery A as acceptable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the small, guaranteed amount from Lottery B would not have made a significant difference, implying they were willing to take on more risk for a potentially greater reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. The individual, however, considered the perceived value of the outcomes and the risk involved, not explicitly mentioning the sum of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the potential for a greater reward, despite the risk, rather than explicitly comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision to choose Lottery A aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the sums of the outcomes of the two lotteries. The focus was more on the perceived value and risk rather than the specific rule of summing outcomes independent of probabilities. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome, the reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -5000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but doesn't change the sum). For Lottery A, the sum is -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the total outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual. The verbal report is ""Auf die 5 Euro kommt es nicht an,"" which translates to ""The 5 Euros don't matter."" This suggests the individual considered the -5 Euros outcome of Lottery A but deemed it insignificant.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies the individual's focus was not on the magnitude of the loss in Lottery A, suggesting the decision might not have been based on a straightforward comparison of the outcomes or their sums.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the total outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it seems the individual focused on the specific outcome of Lottery A (-5 Euros) rather than the sum of all outcomes for each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (the 5 Euros don't matter), there's a discrepancy. The decision reason would suggest preferring Lottery A because -5 Euros is greater than -5000 Euros, but the individual's statement does not indicate a consideration of the total outcomes or their comparison.

The verbal report does not align with the decision reason's process of summing all outcomes and comparing them. The individual's focus on the insignificance of the 5 Euros loss in Lottery A does not reflect the decision reason's rule, indicating the decision reason was likely not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B since it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of winning and losing in Lottery A being equal and Lottery B being solely profitable. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice focuses on the certainty of a gain in Lottery B and the equal chances of winning or losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and profitability), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes for each lottery as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the certainty of gain and equal chances), the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual seems to prioritize the certainty of a positive outcome over the sum of all possible outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 + (-3000) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (2000 > 0).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning and losing in Lottery A and the guaranteed win in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual mentions the guaranteed win in Lottery B but does not explicitly discuss the sum of outcomes or compare the total possible outcomes between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual does not explicitly mention considering the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the guaranteed win in Lottery B, not on the sum of outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the sum of all outcomes of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability, so its sum is simply 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability, but since the reason considers the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, we calculate it as 3000 + (-3000) = 0 Euros. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a sum of 1000 Euros and Lottery B has a sum of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery A appears to bring a win in every case, implying they recognize the certainty of the outcome. For Lottery B, they note it has equal parts risk and chance, acknowledging the presence of both a potential gain and a potential loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the certainty of a win with Lottery A and the balanced risk and chance of Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes or comparing the total potential wins and losses of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, while the individual considers the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A and the balance of risk and chance for Lottery B. There's no direct mention of summing outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is based on the certainty of a win and the perceived risk, not explicitly on the sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves summing the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities to make the decision. The focus was more on the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A and the risk/chance balance for Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + (-6000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcome sums of both lotteries, which are 0 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions wanting to avoid risk and notes that Lottery B was the option to avoid losing anything. This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect and the potential for loss in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on avoiding risk and not losing anything, which implies a focus on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing outcome sums.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcome sums of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and potential loss). The individual does not mention calculating or comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding risk and loss). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries (as both have an outcome sum of 0 Euros), but the individual chose based on risk aversion, not the sum of outcomes.
