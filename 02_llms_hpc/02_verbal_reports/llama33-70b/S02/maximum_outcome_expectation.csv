1,"lichkeit von 0€ ja äußerst gering ist und die möglichen 100€ ja nicht ganz unwahrscheinlich sind

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%, so the product is 2500 * 0.33 = 825. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%, so the product is 2400 * 1 = 2400. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that there are no losses in Lottery B, the low probability of 0 Euros, and the possibility of gaining an additional amount (implied by ""die möglichen 100€"") compared to a fixed amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of losing (0 Euros) is very low and the possibility of gaining extra (100 Euros more than a base amount, presumably 2400 Euros) is not very unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual's consideration involves the concept of potential gains and the low probability of loss but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing products of outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification is based on the perception of potential gains and the low risk of loss, not explicitly on comparing products of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the specific decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities for each lottery. The focus is more on the presence of a potential gain and the low probability of loss rather than on the calculated products."
2,"igere Variante entschieden, da der Unterschied der Wahrscheinlichkeit von einem Prozent schließlich auch nicht groß war

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, this product is 2400 * 0.34 = 816. For Lottery B, the product is 2500 * 0.33 = 825. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum outcomes (2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B) and their respective probabilities (34% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the maximum outcomes (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1 percentage point) between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risky option), implying they preferred the lottery with the potentially higher reward despite slightly lower probability, because the differences in both outcome and probability were not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, while the individual considered the differences in outcomes and probabilities but not explicitly their products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of maximum outcome and probability (which would be Lottery B), and the individual chose based on the riskiness of the options, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of products or a direct comparison of the products of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities. The focus on riskiness and the comparison of differences in outcomes and probabilities without explicit calculation of products or their comparison suggests that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's decision. However, the choice of the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (Lottery B) coincidentally aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (since Lottery B has a slightly higher product of outcome and probability), but this does not seem to be due to the application of the decision reason as described."
3,"setzen zu wollen mit den 20% icht-gewinn bei Lotterie B (auch da es sich um relativ hohe Summen handelt -> besser haben als Spielen)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 3000 * 1 = 3000. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability, so the product is 4000 * 0.8 = 3200. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities (3000 for Lottery A and 3200 for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of security and the desire not to gamble with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially since the sums involved are relatively high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on a preference for security and not wanting to risk losing, indicating a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the potential maximum gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, while the individual considered the security aspect and the risk associated with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B. There is a mismatch because the individual's focus was more on the risk and security rather than directly comparing the products of outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product (which would be Lottery B with a product of 3200), but the individual's justification emphasizes the desire for security and avoiding risk, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A due to its 100% probability of winning, even though it has a lower product according to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on security and avoiding risk, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery B due to its higher product, but the individual's justification suggests a different rationale that emphasizes certainty over potential maximum gain. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

in dem Fall potentiell höherer Gewinn bei Lotterie B angelockt, da Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied von 5% nicht so groß erscheint

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery B, this product is 4000 * 0.20 = 800. For Lottery A, the product is 3000 * 0.25 = 750. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B and notes that the probability difference of 5% does not seem so significant. This implies the individual considered the maximum outcomes and the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be drawn to Lottery B because of its potentially higher gain, despite acknowledging a relatively small probability difference between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which involves both the potential gain and the probability. The individual considered the potential gain and the probability difference, which aligns with the components of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual is drawn to Lottery B due to its higher potential gain and seems to weigh this against the probability difference, which could imply a consideration of the overall value or expected gain from each lottery, similar to the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment is based on the alignment between the components considered by the decision reason and those mentioned by the individual in the verbal report, as well as the individual's justification that seems to weigh the potential gains against the probabilities, similar to the decision reason's rule. However, the individual's focus on the ""potential for a higher gain"" and the ""probability difference not seeming so significant"" does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the products of outcomes and probabilities, which introduces some uncertainty. Thus, while it appears likely that the individual used a reasoning process similar to the decision reason, it is not certain."
5,"der doppelt so hohe Gewinn auf der anderen Seite nicht locken konnte; außerdem war bei B bschreckend, dass es unter 50% waren

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 90%, so the product is 3000 * 0.9 = 2700. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 45%, so the product is 6000 * 0.45 = 2700. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery A and found it very enticing. They also considered the lower probability of winning in Lottery B (under 50%) and found it discouraging.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the high probability of winning in Lottery A was more attractive than the potential for a higher win in Lottery B, which had a lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these products. Instead, they focus on the attractiveness of the high probability in Lottery A and the discouraging aspect of the low probability in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. Although the products for both lotteries are equal (2700), the individual's justification does not indicate a consideration of these products. Instead, they seem to prioritize the high probability of a win over the potential for a higher payout.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. The individual's focus on the probabilities and the attractiveness of the certain outcome, rather than the calculated products, suggests that they did not use this specific decision reason to make their choice."

Da Wahrscheinlichkeit des Gewinns sowieso verschwindend gering war das Gefühl, dass es relativ egal ist und ich dann ja auch auf den höheren Gewinn setzen kann

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the product is 3000 * 0.002 = 6. For Lottery B, the product is 6000 * 0.001 = 6. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of winning is extremely low (""verschwindend gering""), suggesting they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating it feels relatively indifferent due to the low probabilities, and thus they opted for the higher potential gain (""höheren Gewinn"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the products of the outcomes and their probabilities. While the individual considered the low probabilities, there's no direct mention of calculating or comparing the products of the outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification focuses on the indifference due to low probabilities and the preference for the higher potential gain, which aligns with preferring the higher outcome when probabilities are perceived as similarly low.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the low probabilities and a preference for the higher potential gain, which could align with the decision reason's outcome but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the products of the outcomes and probabilities as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."

Auch wenn definitiver Verlust unattraktiv ist, erschienen mir die 20% für icht-Verlust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is -3000 * 1 = -3000. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability, so the product is 0 * 0.2 = 0. Since the reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, it would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on this calculation. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the definitive loss as unattractive but weighs the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B against the additional 1000 Euros loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the trade-off between the probability of avoiding loss and the magnitude of the potential loss, specifically mentioning the 20% chance of no loss and the 1000 Euros difference in potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses probabilities and outcomes but in a different context (comparing the attractiveness of avoiding a loss).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual’s justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing products of outcomes and probabilities but rather compares the risk of loss and its magnitude.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the comparison of potential losses and the probability of avoiding a loss rather than on the products of outcomes and probabilities.

8,"ussen; letztendlich für die kleinere Verlustsumme entschieden (vermutlich weil 4000€ doch erschreckend viel klingt)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the best outcome), and its probability is 75%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros, and its probability is 80%. The products are:
- For Lottery A: 0 * 75% = 0
- For Lottery B: 0 * 80% = 0
Both products are 0, making the decision reason applicable but resulting in a tie according to its rule since both lotteries have the same product (0) for their maximum outcomes. This step indicates the decision reason can be applied but does not differentiate between the lotteries based on the maximum outcome (0 Euros) for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to have considered the difference in potential losses (5% difference in probabilities and the actual amounts of -4000 Euros vs. -3000 Euros) and the psychological impact of the larger loss (-4000 Euros being ""erschreckend viel"", or frighteningly much).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the smaller loss, indicating a preference for the lesser of two evils based on the potential losses rather than the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which in this case is 0 for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the potential losses and their psychological impact, not the product of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the maximum outcome (since both have a product of 0), but the individual's justification is based on minimizing loss, not on the product of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on minimizing loss and the psychological impact of potential losses, rather than the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
9,"eben große Wahrscheinlichkeit, deshalb nach längerem Zögern für A entschieden, da Wahrscheinlichkeit immerhin unter 50%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, it's -3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- For Lottery A: -6000 * 0.45
- For Lottery B: -3000 * 0.90
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the initial results, considered the higher loss in Lottery A but also its lower probability compared to the loss in Lottery B, and noted the significant uncertainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after considerable hesitation because the probability of the loss was less than 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but the individual's considerations, as described, focus more on the comparison of the losses and their probabilities in a qualitative manner, not explicitly calculating or comparing the products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the probability being under 50%, which does not directly align with calculating and comparing the products of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's deliberation process, as described, does not directly involve calculating or comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on the probability being under 50% for Lottery A and the comparison of losses without explicit mention of calculating products suggests that the decision reason was not used."
10,"€ bei Lotterie A ist definitiv eängstigender, zumal der Unterschied der Wahrscheinlichkeiten ja wirklich äußerst minimal ist

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the product is -6000 * 0.1% = -6. For Lottery B, the product is -3000 * 0.2% = -6. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the maximum outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as being ""definitiv beängstigender"" (definitely more frightening) and notes that the difference in probabilities is ""äußerst minimal"" (extremely minimal). This indicates the individual considered the magnitude of the potential loss and the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the fear of the larger loss in Lottery A and the minimal difference in probabilities, rather than directly comparing the products of outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, which were calculated in Step 1. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of the loss and the minimal difference in probabilities, not directly on these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing these products but instead emphasizes the fear of a larger loss and the minimal probability difference.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the products of the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the psychological impact of the potential losses and the similarity in probabilities, rather than on the specific mathematical products.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is 1000 * 0.5 = 500. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 500 * 1 = 500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be considering the attractiveness of receiving a certain amount of money, indicating an awareness of the guaranteed outcome in one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds it more attractive to receive a certain amount of money, implying a preference for the guaranteed outcome over the risk of losing. The mention of not being made more risk-tolerant by additional credit suggests a consideration of risk aversion.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations seem more aligned with the attractiveness of certainty rather than the specific calculation of outcome-probability products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. However, the individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of receiving a certain amount of money, which aligns more with a preference for certainty rather than a direct comparison of the outcome-probability products.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly mention the calculation or comparison of the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, which is central to the decision reason. The individual's focus on the attractiveness of certainty and risk aversion does not clearly align with the decision reason's specific rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."
12,"igere Variante B genommen; zu 100% Verlust zu haben (Variante A) ist nicht gerade attraktiv

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 50% probability, resulting in a product of 0 * 0.5 = 0. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability, but since the outcome is negative, it's not considered ""maximum"" in the traditional sense of being the most favorable. However, following the decision reason's logic strictly, we would still calculate the product as -500 * 1 = -500. The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the higher product, which in this case would be Lottery B because 0 is greater than -500. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional funds, possibly leading to a more risk-seeking choice (Variante B). They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the certainty of loss in Lottery A, finding it unattractive, and possibly by factors external to the lotteries themselves, like their current financial situation and a potential preference for riskier options when having more funds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, discusses the certainty of loss, risk preference influenced by external factors, and does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing products of outcomes and probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which would be Lottery B in this scenario. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a preference based on the calculated products, does express a distaste for the certain loss of Lottery A, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific rule.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria (calculating and comparing the products of maximum outcomes and their probabilities). However, the individual's choice and some aspects of their justification (preferring the uncertain outcome over the certain loss) could indirectly align with the outcome of applying the decision reason. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability, so the product is 6000 * 0.25 = 1500. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability, so the product is 4000 * 0.25 = 1000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products calculated.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something in each lottery and the height of the potential winnings. Specifically, they noted that the probability of winning something was higher in Lottery B, even though the potential winnings were lower than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a higher probability of winning something, despite the lower potential winnings compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the probability of winning and the height of the winnings but did not directly compare the products of these values for each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which would be Lottery A (1500) over Lottery B (1000). However, the individual's justification was based on the desire to win something, given the higher probability of a win in Lottery B, not directly on comparing the products of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason, which involves calculating and comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, does not match the considerations and justifications provided in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning something and the comparative heights of the potential winnings, rather than the specific products of outcomes and probabilities as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability, so the product is -6000 * 0.25 = -1500. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 25% probability (since -4000 is the maximum loss, not gain, but in this context, it's about the magnitude of the outcome), so the product is -4000 * 0.25 = -1000. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the difficulty of making decisions involving losses and the high value of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, which seems to deter them. The individual also mentions being uncertain and notes that losses are more likely in Lottery B. The information considered by the individual includes the high value of the potential loss in Lottery A and the higher likelihood of any loss in Lottery B. The individual's justification for their choice (though not explicitly stated) seems to involve aversion to high losses and uncertainty about the outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of maximum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (high value of potential loss in Lottery A, higher likelihood of any loss in Lottery B, and personal difficulty with loss decisions), it appears the individual does not directly consider the product of the maximum outcome and its probability as described by the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice seems more aligned with loss aversion and uncertainty rather than a straightforward calculation of the products of outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability) does not directly match the individual's justification for the choice, which is more qualitative and based on aversion to losses and uncertainty.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability, resulting in a product of 5 * 1 = 5. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% (or 0.001) probability, resulting in a product of 5000 * 0.001 = 5. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the potential loss and gain from choosing Lottery B, indicating they thought about the outcomes and their probabilities. They mention the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B, showing they considered the probability aspect. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (implied, as the report discusses the choice in the context of not choosing Lottery B) seems to hinge on the perceived unattractiveness of the low probability of the significant gain in Lottery B, despite not directly stating a comparison of products of outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of maximum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities), it appears the individual did consider the components necessary for the decision reason, though not explicitly calculating or mentioning the products.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of maximum outcome and probability) to the individual's justification (focusing on the low probability of the large gain making it unattractive), it seems the individual's decision process might align with the spirit of considering how probability affects the attractiveness of an outcome, but does not directly reflect the specific rule of comparing products of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), their justification does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason (comparing products of maximum outcomes and their probabilities). The individual's focus on the low probability of the large gain as a deterrent suggests an intuitive understanding that might indirectly relate to the decision reason but does not clearly demonstrate its application."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since -5000 Euros is a loss and not a gain), and its probability is 99.9%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros (which is a loss, but since it's the only outcome, we consider it), and its probability is 100%. However, to apply the decision reason as stated, we interpret it in the context of losses, thus considering the ""maximum loss"" or the least negative outcome and its probability. For Lottery B, the least negative (or maximum in the context of minimizing loss) outcome is 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, and the significant loss is -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros with 100% probability. The products for the ""maximum"" (least negative) outcomes are: for Lottery B, 0 Euros * 99.9% = 0; for Lottery A, since we're dealing with a loss, we consider the product of the loss and its probability, which is -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros. However, to correctly apply the decision reason as it seems to be intended (focusing on the least negative outcome or minimizing loss), we should look at the products of the outcomes and their probabilities in a way that aligns with minimizing loss or maximizing gain. Thus, for Lottery B, the calculation based on the least negative outcome (0 Euros) doesn't directly apply as the decision reason seems to be misinterpreted in the context of losses. The correct interpretation for applying the reason should consider the expected value or the product of the loss and its probability for a more accurate assessment in the context of minimizing losses. 

Given the nature of the decision reason and the lotteries, the relevant information for the decision reason (products of outcomes and their probabilities) can be derived but requires a nuanced understanding, especially since one lottery offers a certain loss and the other a potential significant loss with a very low probability. The decision reason, as stated, prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but this seems to be more directly applicable to scenarios where gains are considered rather than losses.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the very low probability of loss in Lottery B and compares it to the certain but small loss in Lottery A. 
Second, the individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential loss in Lottery B, although very unlikely, is outweighed by the certainty and small amount of the loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the small, certain loss is ""irrelevant"" in comparison, implying a risk-averse or loss-averse stance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (low probability of significant loss vs. certain small loss), it appears the individual is considering aspects of the lotteries but not explicitly calculating or mentioning the products of outcomes and probabilities as the decision reason suggests. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the irrelevance of the small certain loss compared to the potential large loss with very low probability), it seems the individual is making a decision based on risk aversion or loss aversion rather than directly applying the rule of maximizing the product of the outcome and its probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which does not directly apply to the scenario of minimizing losses as presented. The individual's justification is more in line with a risk-averse or loss-averse perspective rather than calculating and comparing the products of outcomes and their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as stated, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is 3000 * 0.5 = 1500. For Lottery B, the maximum (and only) outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 1500 * 1 = 1500. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 50% probability in Lottery A and preferred the smaller but certain gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring a smaller certain gain over a riskier option that includes a significant loss, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, which are equal for both lotteries (1500). However, the individual's consideration focuses on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain, not explicitly on these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but since the products are equal, it would be indifferent. The individual, however, is not indifferent and chooses based on risk aversion, preferring the certain gain over the risky option.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0 because the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities. The individual's focus on risk aversion and preference for a certain gain over a risky option does not indicate the use of the specified decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is 3000 * 0.5 = 1500. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 2000 * 1 = 2000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products calculated.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the appeal of a definitive win, especially after many loss decisions in previous rounds, and expresses no desire to play with more risk. This indicates the individual considered the certainty of the outcome and their recent experiences with losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to be based on the desire for a certain win and the avoidance of further risk, given their recent losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the certainty of the win and risk avoidance.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, whereas the individual's justification is about avoiding risk and seeking a certain gain, not explicitly about maximizing the product of outcome and probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus is more on risk avoidance and the certainty of a gain, rather than on the specific mathematical product of outcomes and probabilities.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 1000 * 1 = 1000. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is 3000 * 0.5 = 1500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products calculated for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain from Lottery A compared to the potential loss from Lottery B, taking into account the probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the gain from A is more attractive than the possible three times higher loss from B, especially since the probability of winning in B is only 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, whereas the individual considered the attractiveness of gains and losses along with probabilities, but not explicitly calculating or comparing products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these products or following this rule. Instead, the individual seems to focus on the relative attractiveness of the certain gain versus the risky option, considering the potential loss and its probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is closer to 0 because the individual's verbal report does not directly mention calculating or comparing the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities as the basis for their decision. While the individual does consider the probabilities and outcomes, their justification does not align closely with the decision reason's specific rule, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 0 * 1 = 0. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is 6000 * 0.5 = 3000. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk, implying they considered the potential loss and gain of Lottery B. They also mention that taking a ""Durchgang Pause"" (a passage or round of pause) seems in order, which could imply considering the certainty of Lottery A as a form of taking a break from risk.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing concern over the large sum at risk in Lottery B and seems to lean towards the safety of not risking any money, as implied by mentioning the large sum being too much to risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, focuses on the risk associated with the large sum and the idea of not risking money, which does not directly align with calculating products of outcomes and probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, which would be Lottery B (3000 > 0). The individual’s justification, however, is based on risk aversion and the desire not to risk a large sum, which leads them away from Lottery B, not necessarily because of the product of the outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. The focus on risk aversion and avoiding large potential losses rather than on the specific calculation of outcome-probability products indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
