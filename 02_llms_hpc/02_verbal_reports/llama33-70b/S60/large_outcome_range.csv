STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2400 Euros (since it is a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 33% chance of winning more in Lottery A than in Lottery B and acknowledged a small risk of winning nothing, which they deemed extremely low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential for a higher gain against the minimal risk of losing, finding the risk acceptable for the potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential for a higher gain and the risk of winning nothing, which aligns with considering outcomes but does not directly address the maximum-minimum difference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. The individual's justification is about the potential for a higher gain being worth the small risk, which indirectly relates to the concept of outcome differences but does not explicitly follow the rule of maximizing the difference between minimum and maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly address the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision, nor does it explicitly follow the rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between these outcomes. While the individual considers the potential for higher gain and the risk of loss, the focus is more on the risk-reward tradeoff rather than the specific rule of maximizing the difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the indirect consideration of outcome differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in the probability of winning in both lotteries and the potential gain being roughly the same but slightly higher in one.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potentially higher gain because the probabilities of winning were similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the similarity in probabilities and the potential gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes. The individual's justification was based on the similarity in probabilities and the choice of the higher potential gain, not explicitly on the difference between the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as it is defined. The decision reason specifically looks at the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes to make a choice, whereas the individual's justification in the verbal report focuses on the similarity in winning probabilities and the choice of the higher potential gain without explicitly discussing the outcome differences.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros in Lottery A versus the risk of gaining nothing in Lottery B. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on the importance of having a certain gain over taking a risk, which implies a preference for avoiding the possibility of receiving the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (certainty versus risk), it appears the individual focused more on the aspect of certainty rather than directly comparing the differences between the outcomes. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring certainty over risk), it seems the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritized avoiding risk rather than seeking the larger difference between outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, as stated in the report (""Ich habe mir die Wahrscheinlichkeiten angeschaut""). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on preferring a higher probability of winning (""lieber eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Gewinn einzugehen""). 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes) does not match the information considered by the individual (the probabilities). 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring a higher probability of winning). 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, the preferred lottery would be the one with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning (mentioned as ""Wahrscheinlichkeit höher ist mit einem Gewinn rauszugehen"") and their previous experiences or decisions (""vor 2 Runden schon ins Risiko gegangen war"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of its higher probability of winning and possibly to avoid risk after having taken risks in previous rounds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which does not match the information considered by the individual (probability of winning and previous risk-taking).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, whereas the individual chose Lottery A based on its higher probability of winning and risk avoidance, not mentioning the difference between outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since there's no positive outcome, this is the ""best"" outcome in terms of loss) and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case is Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at the probabilities and noticed that in Lottery A, there was a high probability of losing money, while in Lottery B, there was at least a 55% chance of not losing anything (i.e., getting 0 Euros). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the aspect of losing money versus not losing money, highlighting the higher chance of avoiding loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing versus not losing), we see that the individual's focus was more on the probabilities of outcomes rather than the magnitude of differences between outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the probability of not losing), it appears that the individual's decision-making process was not directly aligned with calculating or considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason suggests.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. Instead, their decision seems to be influenced by the probabilities of losing versus not losing money, which does not align with the given decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (or more precisely, not losing any money) and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the probability of losing money in Lottery A, which is 0.2%. The individual seems to focus on the risk of losing and the amount that would be lost. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the idea of taking a ""slightly higher risk"" but losing less if that risk materializes. The individual does not explicitly compare the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries but talks about the risk and the amount of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the probability of losing and the amount that would be lost), it appears the individual is focusing on aspects related to loss but not explicitly on the difference between the outcomes as the decision reason dictates. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (taking a slightly higher risk to lose less), there seems to be a misunderstanding or misalignment. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger difference (-6000 to 0 Euros), but the individual's justification suggests a preference for losing less, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its smaller loss amount (-3000 Euros), not necessarily because of the difference between outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 1000 - 0 = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 500 - 500 = 0 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process. The individual considered the aspect of being ""auf Nummer sicher gehen"", which translates to ""playing it safe"". The individual’s justification for the choice is to minimize risk, as indicated by the desire to be safe.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the aspect of being safe), it appears that the individual did not focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. Instead, the individual prioritized minimizing risk. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the desire to be safe, not the difference in outcomes. Therefore, the individual’s justification for the choice does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

The difference between the maximum and minimum outcome for Lottery B is 5000 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 0 Euros. 

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual prioritized avoiding risk and losing a significant amount of money, instead opting for a certain loss of 5 Euros. The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the risk of losing a large amount of money and the certainty of losing a smaller amount. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the importance of avoiding risk and ensuring a smaller loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. Instead, they focused on the risk of losing a large amount of money and the certainty of losing a smaller amount. Comparing the decision reason's rule to the individual's justification for the choice, it seems that the individual's decision was driven more by risk aversion and a desire for certainty rather than the specific difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's consideration is centered around risk aversion and the desire for certainty, not explicitly on the differences between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A due to risk aversion, not because of the difference between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome. The individual's focus on risk aversion and seeking certainty leads to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2000 Euros (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the guarantee of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery B and the risk of losing money with Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was the guarantee of winning and the perceived high risk of losing money with Lottery A. 

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (guarantee and risk), it appears the individual focused more on the guarantee and risk aspect rather than the specific differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for the choice (focusing on the guarantee and risk) does not directly align with this rule. The individual chose Lottery B, which has the smaller difference, indicating their decision was not based on the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - (-3000) = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 1000 - 1000 = 0 Euros (since there is only one outcome). 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the information considered by the individual seems to be related to the concept of ""Sicherheit"" which translates to ""safety"" or ""security"", implying a preference for a certain gain. The individual’s justification for the choice focuses on the importance of having a secure win, which suggests they prioritized the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (security/safety of winning), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as their primary concern. Instead, they focused on the certainty of winning. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A, but the individual's justification does not align with this rule, as they seem to prioritize certainty over the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros. The difference between the maximum and minimum outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros (0 - 0), and for Lottery B is 12000 Euros (6000 - (-6000)). 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and their past decisions, focusing on the need to take a risk after previously playing it safe. The individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on a desire to take a risk and have a buffer, implying a consideration of their current situation and past choices rather than a direct comparison of the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and past decisions), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the range of outcomes, while the individual's deliberation process does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of outcomes between the two lotteries. Furthermore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) does not align with the individual's justification for taking a risk due to past safe choices. Therefore, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.
