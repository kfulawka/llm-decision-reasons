1,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros with 100% probability, which will serve as the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros with probabilities 33%, 66%, and 1%, respectively. The differences between these outcomes and the reference value (2400 Euros) are +100 Euros, 0 Euros, and -2400 Euros. The decision reason evaluates the mean difference considering these differences' probabilities. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 33% chance of winning more in Lottery A compared to Lottery B and acknowledges a small risk of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by considering the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A as worth the small risk of winning nothing, despite considering this risk as very low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual does consider the potential for a higher gain and the risk of winning nothing, which are related to the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the potential higher gain being worth the small risk, which aligns with considering the trade-offs between different outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences based on probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process involves considering the potential benefits and risks, which aligns somewhat with the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and their probabilities. However, the explicit calculation or consideration of mean differences as per the decision reason is not clearly evident in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment indicates that while there are some elements of the decision reason present in the individual's thought process (such as considering the potential for higher gain and the associated risk), the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (calculating and comparing mean differences based on probabilities) is not clearly described in the verbal report. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but leaning towards it not being the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and calculates the mean difference between these outcomes and a reference value. The reference value in this case is zero since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability, and for Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. Since both lotteries have the same reference value (0 Euros), we calculate the mean difference for each lottery by multiplying the outcome by its probability. For Lottery B, the calculation is 2500 * 0.33, and for Lottery A, it is 2400 * 0.34. This information is derivable from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities of winning something in both lotteries and the potential gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potentially higher gain because the probabilities of winning were similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate mean differences, while the individual considered the similarity in winning probabilities and the potential gain. The individual's focus aligns partially with the information relevant to the decision reason but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or considering the reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the differences' probabilities. The individual preferred the lottery with the potentially higher gain due to similar winning probabilities. The individual's justification does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences but does consider the potential gain, which is a component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report indicates some alignment with the decision reason, such as considering the potential gain, but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value. The justification for the choice is based on the similarity of winning probabilities and the potential for a higher gain, which only partially aligns with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while there is some indication that the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason, the report does not clearly demonstrate the use of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, the reference value is the sure outcome of Lottery A, which is 3000 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of both lotteries and their respective probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (4000 - 3000) * 0.8 + (0 - 3000) * 0.2, which simplifies to 800 - 600 = 200. For Lottery A, since it is the reference point, the mean difference is 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the differences' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered having 3000 Euros as a sure outcome versus taking the risk of possibly getting nothing (0 Euros) with a 20% probability from Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized having a sure 3000 Euros over taking the risk associated with Lottery B, indicating a preference for certainty over potential higher gain with risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk of getting nothing in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or comparing them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities, while the individual preferred the sure outcome due to risk aversion. The individual's justification emphasizes the importance of avoiding the risk of getting nothing, which indirectly relates to the concept of mean differences but is more directly related to risk aversion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding risk and preferring a certain outcome over a potentially higher but risky gain suggests that while they considered elements relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities), their justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences. The verbal report indicates a risk-averse attitude rather than a detailed calculation of mean differences as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason, as defined, was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, and calculates the mean difference between the outcomes and a reference value. Since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean difference is (3000 * 0.25) - (0 * 0.75) = 750. For Lottery B, the mean difference is (4000 * 0.2) - (0 * 0.8) = 800. This information can be used to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries. The report mentions ""Ich habe mir die Wahrscheinlichkeiten angeschaut"", which indicates that the individual looked at the probabilities. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is to prefer a higher probability of winning, as stated in ""lieber eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Gewinn einzugehen"". The described deliberation process focuses on the probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean differences between outcomes and reference value) with that considered by the individual (probabilities), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean differences. However, the decision reason does involve considering the probabilities of the outcomes, which the individual did. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the more favorable mean difference) to the individual's justification (prefer a higher probability of winning), it seems that the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus on the probability of winning does not necessarily imply a consideration of the mean differences between the outcomes and the reference value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely, but not certain, that the decision reason was used by the individual. The individual's focus on probabilities is related to the decision reason, but the justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, and the mean differences were not explicitly considered."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate the mean difference for each lottery. Since both lotteries have defined outcomes (in Euros) and probabilities, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived. The reference value, as per the decision reason, is zero since there's no sure outcome in the decision problem. The mean difference for each lottery can be calculated as follows:
- Lottery A: (3000 * 0.9) - 0 = 2700
- Lottery B: (6000 * 0.45) - 0 = 2700
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. Since both lotteries have the same mean difference (2700), according to the decision reason, the individual should be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery and their past experiences with risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a higher probability of winning and they had already taken risks in previous rounds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences of the outcomes, considering their probabilities, while the individual considered the probability of winning and past experiences with risk. The individual's consideration does not directly align with the calculations of mean differences as required by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean differences, but the individual chose Lottery A based on its higher probability of winning and past risk-taking, not directly because of the mean differences or their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason was not used by the individual, as the individual's justification and considered information do not align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and their probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities to calculate the mean difference. In this case, there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, so the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes (6000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B, 3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A) and their respective probabilities (0.1% and 99.9% for Lottery B, 0.2% and 99.8% for Lottery A). This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

The mean difference for Lottery B is calculated as (6000 * 0.001) - (0 * 0.999) = 6.
The mean difference for Lottery A is calculated as (3000 * 0.002) - (0 * 0.998) = 6.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning something is higher in this lottery. The information considered by the individual seems to be the probability of winning in each lottery. The justification for the choice is based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning, not directly on the outcomes or their mean differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities to calculate mean differences) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), there seems to be a partial overlap but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or considering mean differences. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference) does not directly align with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning something). However, since the mean differences are equal for both lotteries, the decision reason would not provide a clear preference based on mean differences, which might not directly influence the individual's decision process as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The low assessment score reflects that while the individual's decision is consistent with the outcomes of the decision reason (since both lotteries have the same mean difference, the reason does not prefer one over the other), the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly considered the mean differences or applied the decision reason's rule to make the choice. The focus on the probability of winning suggests a different decision-making process."
7,"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of -3000 Euros with 100% probability. Therefore, the reference value is -3000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are considered important. For Lottery B, the differences are -4000 - (-3000) = -1000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 - (-3000) = 3000 Euros with 20% probability. For Lottery A, the difference is -3000 - (-3000) = 0 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B is (-1000 * 0.8) + (3000 * 0.2) = -800 + 600 = -200 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the possibility of not losing money in one of the lotteries. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual preferred participating in the lottery where there is a chance of not losing money, rather than the one where it is certain to lose 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, considering a reference value. The individual considered the probabilities and the aspect of not losing money, which aligns with the idea of comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, while the individual prefers the lottery with a chance of not losing money, which indirectly relates to preferring a more favorable outcome but does not directly mention mean differences or the specific calculation involved in the decision reason. Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process shares some intuitive aspects with the decision reason, such as considering the potential for not losing money, but does not directly align with the specific calculations or reference value use described in the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities to calculate the mean difference. In this case, the reference value is zero since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries:
- Lottery B: -4000 Euros with 20% probability, 0 Euros with 80% probability
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability
The mean difference for Lottery B is (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800.
The mean difference for Lottery A is (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750.
This information is derivable from the given lotteries, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions looking at the probabilities several times, indicating consideration of the likelihoods of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the ""potentiell geringeren Verlust,"" which translates to ""potentially smaller loss."" This implies the individual considered the magnitude of potential losses in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and the potential for a smaller loss, which aligns with comparing the magnitude of losses but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery A with a mean difference of -750 compared to Lottery B's -800. The individual's justification for choosing the ""potentially smaller loss"" aligns with preferring Lottery A, as its loss (-3000 Euros) is smaller than Lottery B's (-4000 Euros), even though the probabilities differ.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's consideration of probabilities and the focus on the ""potentially smaller loss"" suggest an alignment with the decision reason's emphasis on comparing outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or directly comparing the expected values of the lotteries. Therefore, while there is evidence to suggest the decision reason might have been used, it is not a perfect match, leading to a score below 100 but above 50, indicating a likelihood that the decision reason was used, but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability. The reference value is 0 since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, and -6000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B. These differences and their probabilities are relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, noting that Lottery A has a high probability of losing money and Lottery B has a 55% chance of not losing money.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on the comparison of the probabilities of losing money in the two lotteries, highlighting the relatively higher chance of not losing money in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between outcomes and the reference value, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing money), there seems to be a partial overlap. The individual considered the probabilities but not explicitly the differences between outcomes and a reference value.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities) with the individual's justification (comparing probabilities of losing money), there is a discrepancy. The individual's focus was on the probability of not losing money rather than on the mean difference of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered some aspects related to the decision reason (probabilities), the focus and justification provided in the verbal report do not closely align with the decision reason's specific criteria (mean difference considering probabilities). The individual's reasoning seems to be more simplistic and focused on the avoidance of loss rather than a detailed calculation or consideration of mean differences."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities. In this case, Lottery A has a -3000 Euros outcome with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, while Lottery B has a -6000 Euros outcome with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Since there's no sure outcome (100% probability of a non-zero value) in either lottery, the reference value is 0 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is calculated as (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -0.006, and for Lottery B, it's (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -0.006. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 0.2% probability of losing in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by preferring the ""something higher risk"" (implying the slightly higher probability of losing but with a lesser loss amount) in Lottery A, indicating a consideration of both the probability and the amount of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences considering the outcomes' probabilities, while the individual considered the probabilities and the amounts of potential losses but did not explicitly calculate or mention mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers based on mean differences, but the individual's justification seems to focus on the balance between the risk (probability) and the amount of loss, not explicitly on mean differences or their probabilities. However, the individual's mention of preferring a ""something higher risk"" but with less loss suggests an implicit consideration of the trade-off that could align with preferring a more favorable mean difference, albeit not explicitly stated in terms of mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's justification touches upon elements relevant to the decision reason (consideration of probabilities and outcomes), it does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and their probabilities. The individual's reasoning seems more intuitive and risk-aversion based rather than a calculated comparison of mean differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated as (1000-500)*0.5 + (0-500)*0.5 = 250*0.5 - 500*0.5 = -250. For Lottery B, since it is the reference point itself, its mean difference would be 0 (500-500 = 0). Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a more favorable mean difference (0) compared to Lottery A (-250).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions wanting to ""be on the safe side"" (""auf Nummer sicher gehen""), indicating a preference for avoiding risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it seemed safer, implying a desire for certainty over potential higher reward with risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, using a reference value derived from a sure outcome if available. The individual's consideration, however, focuses on the safety aspect, which aligns with preferring a sure outcome but doesn't explicitly mention calculations or comparisons of mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its zero mean difference (as it is the reference point). The individual also chose Lottery B but justified it based on wanting to ""be on the safe side,"" which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason but doesn't explicitly follow the same calculation-based logic.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's choice and the decision reason both lead to the selection of Lottery B, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention the calculation of mean differences or the use of a reference value as outlined in the decision reason. The individual's justification is based on a desire for safety, which is consistent with but not a direct application of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the reference value is -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are considered important. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as: ((-1000 - (-500)) * 0.5 + (0 - (-500)) * 0.5) = (-500 * 0.5 + 500 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery A, since it's a sure outcome, the mean difference is 0 (as there's no variation from the reference). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. Given that Lottery B has a mean difference of 0 and Lottery A also effectively has a mean difference of 0 when considering the reference, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on the calculated mean differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions wanting to ""mindestens mit +1500€ rausgehen"" (at least get out with +1500€), indicating a consideration of potential gains or losses and a specific threshold. They also mention that in the other lottery (implied to be Lottery A), ""das Risiko zu hoch ist die Hälfte zu verlieren"" (the risk is too high to lose half), which suggests a consideration of risk and potential losses.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted a potential gain of at least +1500€, implying they are seeking a significant positive outcome. They justified their choice by stating the risk of losing half (in Lottery A) was too high, indicating risk aversion to certain losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences from a reference value, considering the probabilities of outcomes. The individual, however, discusses potential gains, risks, and a desire for a significant positive outcome, not explicitly mentioning mean differences or a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries based on mean differences, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a desire for a significant gain and aversion to the certain loss in Lottery A. This does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on mean differences from a reference value.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. Their justification focuses on risk aversion, desired outcomes, and perceived risk, rather than mean differences from a reference value.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there is no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is zero. The reason calculates the mean difference between the outcomes and this reference value, weighted by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the calculation involves (6000 * 0.25) - (0 * 0.75) = 1500. For Lottery B, it involves (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) - (0 * 0.50) = 1500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning something in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the option that offered a chance to win something with a higher probability, specifically mentioning the preference for a 50% chance over a 25% chance to win.

The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating the mean difference between the outcomes and a reference value. The reference value is determined as the value of a sure outcome if present, or zero if not. In this case, since there is no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is 0 Euros. The relevant information for Lottery A is: -6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. For Lottery B, it is: -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The mean difference for each lottery can be calculated based on these probabilities and outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing money in each lottery, implying they looked at the probabilities of outcomes where no loss occurs (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed the chance of not losing money was greater in Lottery A than in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences from a reference value (0 Euros in this case) and considering their probabilities. The individual focused on the chance of not losing money, which indirectly relates to the probabilities of the 0 Euro outcomes but does not directly involve calculating mean differences or considering all outcomes' probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities, whereas the individual's justification is based on the perceived higher chance of not losing money, not explicitly on mean differences or a comprehensive evaluation of all outcomes and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of not losing money and their justification for choosing Lottery A based on this criterion do not directly align with the decision reason's emphasis on calculating and comparing mean differences from a reference value across all outcomes and their probabilities. While there is a superficial alignment in considering probabilities, the core calculation and rationale of the decision reason are not reflected in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied because the information relevant to it can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability, which serves as the reference value since it's a sure outcome. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (5 Euros) are considered. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 (since 5 Euros - 5 Euros = 0). For Lottery B, the differences are 5000 - 5 = 4995 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 - 5 = -5 Euros with 99.9% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential to win more money in Lottery B and the felt possible gain being higher in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its higher potential win and the subjective feeling that the possible gain is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between outcomes and a reference value (5 Euros in this case), considering their probabilities. The individual, however, focused on the potential for a higher win and subjective feelings about possible gains, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of differences from a reference point or their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or considering probabilities in the decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on calculating differences from a reference value and considering their probabilities to determine preference. The report instead emphasizes the potential for a higher win and subjective feelings, without explicit mention of the decision reason's key components. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision problem poses a choice between two lotteries, A and B. Lottery A offers a sure outcome of -5 Euros, and Lottery B offers a -5000 Euros outcome with 0.1% probability and a 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability. The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which in this case is -5 Euros, the value of the sure outcome in Lottery A. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are: for Lottery A, the difference is 0 (since -5 - (-5) = 0), and for Lottery B, the differences are -5000 - (-5) = -4995 with 0.1% probability and 0 - (-5) = 5 with 99.9% probability. The decision reason calculates the mean difference for each lottery, considering the probabilities of these differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a significant amount of money in Lottery B and the certainty of losing a smaller amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it was more important to avoid the risk of losing a large amount of money, opting instead for the certainty of losing only 5 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual considered the risk and the certainty of outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating differences from a reference point or considering probabilities in a quantitative manner.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification is based on avoiding risk and preferring a certain, smaller loss, which aligns with preferring a more predictable outcome but does not explicitly mention mean differences or a comparison based on probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding risk and preferring certainty aligns with aspects of the decision reason, such as considering the outcomes and their implications. However, the explicit calculation of mean differences and the use of a reference value as described in the decision reason are not clearly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's reasoning seems to be more qualitatively focused on risk avoidance rather than a quantitative comparison of expected outcomes based on the decision reason's specific criteria.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, the reference value is the sure outcome of Lottery A, which is 1500 Euros with 100% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are considered important. For Lottery B, the differences are 3000 - 1500 = 1500 Euros (with 50% probability) and -3000 - 1500 = -4500 Euros (with 50% probability). For Lottery A, the difference is 0 since it is the reference value. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (0.5 * 1500) + (0.5 * -4500) = -1500 Euros. Since Lottery A has a difference of 0, its mean difference is 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery A because 0 is more favorable than -1500.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically the 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros. This suggests they were looking at the potential losses and gains of each lottery. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was to avoid risk, as they mention taking the ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way) and that the risk of losing money in Lottery B was too high. This indicates their decision was influenced by the desire to avoid potential losses and ensure a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes, probabilities, and the reference value) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss in Lottery B and the sure gain of Lottery A), it appears the individual did consider the key elements that the decision reason would focus on, although they might not have explicitly calculated mean differences. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities) with the individual's justification (avoiding risk by choosing the sure gain), while the individual's reasoning is not explicitly about mean differences, their choice to avoid risk and ensure a gain aligns with the outcome the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A due to its more favorable mean difference of 0). However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences based on probabilities, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus on risk avoidance and ensuring a gain could be interpreted as consistent with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, but the process described does not directly match the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40

This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and some of their considerations (like avoiding risk) align with what the decision reason would suggest, the explicit process and criteria (calculating mean differences based on probabilities) are not clearly described in the verbal report. Thus, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, but there are indications that the individual's thought process shared some similarities with the decision reason's logic."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated by considering the differences between its outcomes and the reference value (2000 Euros), weighted by their probabilities. The differences are (3000-2000) = 1000 Euros and (-3000-2000) = -5000 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is (0.5 * 1000) + (0.5 * -5000) = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, since it is the reference point itself, its mean difference is 0 (as the difference between 2000 Euros and 2000 Euros is 0). According to the decision reason, the lottery with the more favorable mean difference is preferred. Since 0 (for Lottery B) is more favorable than -2000 Euros (for Lottery A), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery B and the risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it provided a guarantee of winning 2000 Euros, and the risk of losing money with Lottery A was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the mean differences of the lotteries based on their outcomes and a reference value. The individual considered the guarantee of Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the concept of a reference value (the sure outcome) and risk (which could be seen as related to the probability-weighted outcomes).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case is Lottery B because its mean difference is 0, implying no risk. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was the guarantee it offered, which aligns with preferring a sure outcome over a risky one.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the guarantee provided by Lottery B and the avoidance of risk in Lottery A aligns with the principles of the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the reference value and the probabilities of the outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering mean differences or the specific reference value as defined by the decision reason, which prevents a perfect match. Therefore, while the reasoning seems to align closely with the decision reason's preference for a sure gain over a risky option, it does not perfectly capture the precise calculations or terminology used in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 1000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A considering the reference value (1000 Euros) would be calculated as (0.5 * (3000 - 1000)) + (0.5 * (-3000 - 1000)), simplifying to (0.5 * 2000) + (0.5 * -4000) = 1000 - 2000 = -1000. For Lottery B, the mean difference is 0 since it is the reference value itself. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery B because its mean difference (0) is more favorable than Lottery A's (-1000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""Auch hier war mir die Sicherheit wichtiger etwas zu gewinnen,"" which translates to ""Here, too, security was more important to me to win something."" This indicates the individual prioritized the certainty of winning over the potential for higher gains. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided emphasizes the importance of security in winning, suggesting the individual chose the option that guaranteed a win, which aligns with choosing Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences from a reference value and comparing them. While the individual does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value, they do prioritize the security of winning something, which indirectly aligns with preferring the lottery that offers a guaranteed, positive outcome (Lottery B), similar to what the decision reason would suggest.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this scenario is Lottery B due to its guaranteed positive outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the importance of security in winning, which also leads to preferring Lottery B. Although the individual does not explicitly state they calculated mean differences, their emphasis on security suggests an intuitive alignment with the decision reason's preference for the guaranteed outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's emphasis on the security of winning and the implicit preference for the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B aligns with the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the more favorable mean difference when considering the reference value. However, the individual does not explicitly discuss calculating mean differences or using a reference value, which prevents a perfect alignment with the decision reason. Therefore, while it seems likely the individual's decision-making process shared similarities with the decision reason, it's not a perfect match, leading to an assessment of 80."
20,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers 0 Euros with 100% probability, which serves as the reference value since it is a sure outcome. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B, considering the reference value (0 Euros), would be calculated as (6000 * 0.5 + (-6000) * 0.5) = 0. This implies that the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since the mean difference for both lotteries, relative to the reference value, is the same (0 for Lottery A and 0 for Lottery B when considering the expected value).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and their past behavior of playing it safe, indicating they had a buffer to take the risk now.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on their past behavior of choosing safety and now feeling they have a buffer to take on risk, rather than a direct comparison of the lotteries' outcomes or their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value, but the individual's consideration is more about their past decisions and current ability to take on risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities, which does not align with the individual's justification that is based on past decisions and the ability to take on risk due to having a buffer.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on outcomes, probabilities, and the calculation of mean differences relative to a reference value. Instead, the individual's choice is justified by their past behavior and their current financial situation, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."
