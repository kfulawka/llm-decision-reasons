STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500, 2400, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery A, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of earning more with Lottery B than with Lottery A and views the risk of earning nothing with Lottery B as extremely low (1% probability). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because it offers the possibility of earning more than Lottery A, and the risk of not earning anything is very small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences but does consider the potential for higher earnings and the low risk of not earning anything.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a chance to earn more, which aligns with preferring positive differences but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of such differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process shares some intuitive alignment with the decision reason (preferring a lottery that offers a chance for higher earnings), but the verbal report does not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are (2500 - 1225), (0 - 1225), (2400 - 1225), and (0 - 1225), which are 1275, -1225, 1175, and -1225, respectively. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 33% (since only the 2500 Euros outcome is positive relative to the aspiration level), and for Lottery A, it is 34% (since only the 2400 Euros outcome is positive relative to the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 33% or 34% is ""fast gleich wahrscheinlich"" (almost equally probable), indicating they considered the probabilities of the two lotteries. They then mention preferring the 100 Euros more, which implies they compared the outcomes of the two lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the slight difference in probabilities and the preference for the higher outcome (100 Euros more), suggesting their decision was based on a direct comparison of the potential gains and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes). The individual's consideration does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it, suggesting a potential mismatch.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification (preferring the higher outcome due to similar probabilities). The individual's justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the direct comparison of outcomes and their probabilities rather than the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from this level, which are central to the decision reason. The justification provided focuses on the comparison of outcomes and their probabilities, suggesting a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B offers 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability.
- Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative).
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive).
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions ""80% reicht mir aus, um die 4.000 zu pokern im Vergleich zu 3.000"", which translates to ""80% is enough for me to gamble for 4,000 compared to 3,000"". This indicates the individual considered the probability of winning 4000 Euros and compared it to the guaranteed 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the sufficiency of the 80% probability for choosing the higher potential reward (4000 Euros) over the guaranteed but lower amount (3000 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of the 80% probability and the comparison between 4000 and 3000 Euros does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the perceived sufficiency of the 80% probability for choosing the higher reward, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level as described by the decision reason. While the individual does consider the probability and the outcomes, the justification provided does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual to make the decision. However, the consideration of probability and outcomes in a comparative manner introduces a slight possibility that elements of the decision reason might have influenced the decision, hence a score slightly above 0."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference and an 80% chance of a negative difference, while Lottery B has a 25% chance of a positive difference and a 75% chance of a negative difference. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference in the probability of not getting nothing (or getting a positive outcome) between the two lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a 5% higher chance of not going empty-handed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds this 5% difference significant and therefore chooses Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the difference in probabilities of getting a positive outcome without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual prefers the lottery with a higher probability of not getting nothing, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not explicitly consider an aspiration level or differences from it.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on an aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences from it. However, the individual does consider the probability of getting a positive outcome, which is related to the concept of preferring positive differences. The individual's justification is more straightforward and does not delve into the specific calculations or considerations of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there is a slight alignment in the preference for positive outcomes, the individual's decision-making process as described does not closely follow the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A offers 6000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros and 0 Euros.
The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 6000 - 2250 = 3750 (positive) and 0 - 2250 = -2250 (negative).
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 2250 = 750 (positive) and 0 - 2250 = -2250 (negative).
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We need to calculate these probabilities based on the given probabilities for each lottery:
- Lottery A has a 45% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and a 55% chance of a negative difference (0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 90% chance of a positive difference (3000 Euros) and a 10% chance of a negative difference (0 Euros).
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of positive differences for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions ""3000 EUR fast sicher"" (3000 Euros almost certain) which implies they considered the high probability of getting 3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual states that ""3000 EUR fast sicher ist mir mehr wert"" (3000 Euros almost certain is more valuable to me), indicating they valued the higher certainty of getting a positive outcome (3000 Euros) over the possibility of getting a higher amount with lower probability in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual considered the certainty of getting 3000 Euros, which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, and the individual chose Lottery B because it offers a higher certainty (90%) of getting a positive outcome (3000 Euros), which can be seen as a positive difference from the aspiration level.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of positive outcomes, although the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates that while there are similarities between the individual's reasoning and the decision reason, the verbal report does not fully articulate the specific calculations or considerations outlined in the decision reason, suggesting some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used. However, the individual's emphasis on the value of certainty and the higher probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B leans towards the use of a similar principle as the decision reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. The decision reason considers these differences and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to acknowledge the low probability of winning in both lotteries, implying an understanding of the probabilistic nature of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to ""aim for the higher gain"" since both lotteries likely result in 0 Euros, suggesting a focus on the potential upside of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the higher gain due to both lotteries likely resulting in 0 Euros. However, the aspiration level calculation does imply considering the outcomes, which the individual does by aiming for the higher gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual aims for the higher gain without explicitly mentioning probabilities of differences from an aspiration level. However, aiming for the higher gain could indirectly reflect a preference for a scenario where positive differences (from an implicit aspiration level of 0, given the context of ""both likely end up at 0"") are more significant, aligning somewhat with the spirit of preferring higher positive outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align partially with the decision reason, particularly in the emphasis on outcomes (though the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention an aspiration level or its differences). However, the verbal report lacks explicit mention of probabilities of positive differences, a key component of the decision reason. Thus, while there's a hint of alignment in focusing on the upside, the process described doesn't fully match the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being better than -1000 Euros aspiration level) and Lottery B has no chance of a positive difference (as -3000 is worse than -1000), we can apply this reason to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the amount of -3000 Euros from Lottery B and the possibility of losing more (up to -4000 Euros) with Lottery A, acknowledging the high probability of this greater loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk of losing more with Lottery A compared to the fixed loss of Lottery B, indicating a concern for the potential larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, discusses the risk of larger losses without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 20% chance of resulting in 0 Euros (a positive difference from the -1000 Euro aspiration level). The individual’s justification, however, seems to prioritize avoiding the larger loss, which aligns more with risk aversion rather than the specific rule of preferring higher probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on avoiding the larger loss and the lack of mention of an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences suggest that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) can be calculated as the average of these outcomes: AL = (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -3500 / 4 = -1750 / 2 = -875 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-875) = -3125 and 0 - (-875) = 875; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-875) = -2125 and 0 - (-875) = 875. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 875 Euros with probabilities of 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of losing money in both lotteries and the ability to cope with the loss of 3000 Euros more than 4000 Euros, highlighting a significant difference.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the comparability of losses and the ability to cope with them, indicating that the difference in potential loss amounts is a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual, however, focuses on the comparability of losses and the ability to cope with them, which indirectly relates to the differences in outcomes but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 80% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being a positive difference from the aspiration level), but the individual seems to prioritize the magnitude of potential loss over the probability of losing, which aligns more with considering the impact of negative outcomes rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the magnitude of potential losses and the ability to cope with them, rather than explicitly discussing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level, suggests that while there's a vague alignment with considering outcome differences, the decision reason as defined was not directly applied. The verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of an aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as the basis for the decision, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and this level. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the amount to lose (3000 Euros) and the high chance (almost 100%) associated with Lottery B, comparing it with the lower chance of loss in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential loss and its probability, considering that losing 3000 Euros is ""besser"" (better) due to its high probability, but also notes the relatively lower chance of loss in Option A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential losses and their probabilities, which aligns with the concept of evaluating outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the loss amount and its probability, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or differences from it.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the individual does consider the outcomes and their probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it, which are crucial steps in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), the specific application of the aspiration level and the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used in the manner described."
10,"ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The aspiration level is -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason: Lottery A offers a 0.2% probability of a -3000 Euro outcome and a 99.8% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, while Lottery B offers a 0.1% probability of a -6000 Euro outcome and a 99.9% probability of a 0 Euro outcome. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions both options likely resulting in 0 Euros due to the extremely low probability of loss, and then chooses the ""geschmeidigeren 3.000"" (more flexible 3000), implying consideration of the magnitude of potential losses and possibly the comparative flexibility or lesser severity of the loss in Lottery A.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice by implying that despite both options having a low probability of loss, they prefer the option with the lesser loss magnitude (3000 Euros) as it is more ""geschmeidig"" (flexible or manageable), suggesting an emphasis on the comparative severity of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (comparative severity of losses and their probabilities), there's a partial alignment in that both involve considering the outcomes, but the individual's focus seems more on the direct comparison of loss magnitudes and their manageability rather than calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from it.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification (preferring the lesser loss due to its perceived manageability or flexibility), there's a noticeable difference. The individual's justification doesn't explicitly mention probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level but instead focuses on the comparative magnitudes of potential losses and their implied manageability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual considers the comparative aspects of the losses, the specific rule of the decision reason (focusing on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it) is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual's justification is more intuitive and based on the comparative severity and manageability of losses rather than a calculated aspiration level and its associated probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, let's break down the analysis into the required steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then considered. For Lottery B, the differences are 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative). For Lottery A, the difference is 500 - 500 = 0 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (its difference is 0), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B based on the rule provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions wanting a ""sichere Bank"" (a safe bet or security) before risking money. This implies the individual values certainty or security in their choice.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about having a secure foundation before taking risks, which suggests a preference for avoiding uncertainty or loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not directly align with the individual's stated concern for security or a safe bet.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the desire for security, which aligns more closely with choosing Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed 500 Euros.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report emphasizes the desire for security and a safe bet, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its potential for positive deviation from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's stated preference for security would lead them to choose Lottery A. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (0), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the ""Bilanz"" (which translates to ""balance"" or ""account balance"") is ""quasi gleich"" (approximately equal) for A and B, suggesting they considered the overall value or outcome of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the risk of losing more with A, implying they considered the potential losses and the element of risk in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of the ""Bilanz"" being equal suggests they might have been looking at the overall or average outcomes, but there's no direct mention of calculating differences from an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 50% chance of a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery A but justified it by mentioning the risk of losing more, not explicitly the probability of positive differences or the aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate that they used the decision reason based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. While they chose Lottery A, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer in this scenario, their justification focuses on the risk of losing more rather than the specific criteria of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely the decision reason was used, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment of the choice with the reason's preference."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. The outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 16000 / 5 = 3200 Euros. This is the aspiration level. The decision reason considers the differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can calculate these differences for each outcome: for Lottery B, the differences are 6000 - 3200 = 2800 and 0 - 3200 = -3200; for Lottery A, the differences are 4000 - 3200 = 800, 2000 - 3200 = -1200, and 0 - 3200 = -3200. Now, we can see that the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the chance of winning something (not getting 0 Euros) with Lottery A being 25% higher than with Lottery B, implying they considered the probabilities of non-zero outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that as long as there's a higher chance of winning something (and not getting 0 Euros), the specific amount of the win is less important, as long as it's not 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual's focus is on the chance of winning something versus getting 0 Euros, which aligns with considering the outcomes in relation to a reference point (in this case, 0 Euros, rather than the calculated aspiration level of 3200 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the lottery that offers a higher chance of winning something (not 0 Euros), which can be seen as a simplified version of preferring positive outcomes over a reference point, but does not directly mention comparing differences from an aspiration level.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's justification shares some similarities with the decision reason (focusing on the desirability of outcomes above a certain threshold), it does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of outcomes above this level. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the individual used the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 75% (since the 0 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level). In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 50% (since only the 0 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level, and it occurs with 50% probability, but we also have to consider the -2000 Euro outcome which is above the aspiration level and occurs with 25% probability, thus the total probability of positive differences is 50% + 25% = 75%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything in Lottery A (75%) and the probability of losing in Lottery B (50% chance of losing more, but also mentions the loss at A is ""nur etwas höher"" - only slightly higher - in case of a loss).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the higher probability of not losing anything in Lottery A and the perceived high risk of losing more in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the probabilities of not losing and the magnitude of losses without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery A due to the higher probability of not losing anything and because the potential loss, although higher, is considered only slightly worse than in Lottery B. The individual's justification does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule, as it does not consider the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of outcomes to such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The justification provided focuses on the avoidance of losses and the comparative magnitudes of potential losses rather than the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 = 1668.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 5000 - 1668.33 = 3331.67 (positive) and 0 - 1668.33 = -1668.33 (negative); for Lottery A, 5 - 1668.33 = -1663.33 (negative). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference, while Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is always below the aspiration level). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low gain of Lottery A (""der Gewinn bei A ist sehr gering"") and the very low probability of the higher gain in Lottery B (""die Wahrscheinlichkeit des größeren Gewinns bei B so gering, dass dieser fast ausgeschlossen ist""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because the high gain in B is almost excluded due to its low probability, implying that the certainty of a small gain in A is preferred over the uncertainty of a high gain in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the outcomes and their probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the practical exclusion of the high gain in B due to its low probability, which indirectly touches upon the idea of probabilities but does not explicitly address the concept of aspiration levels or positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined, particularly in calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While the individual considers the outcomes and their probabilities, the focus is more on the practical implications of these probabilities rather than on the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Thus, there is some alignment in the consideration of outcomes and probabilities, but the specific application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high probability (99.9%) of not losing in Lottery A, implying they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on avoiding being the ""poor unlucky person"" who makes a loss, which suggests a consideration of the potential loss but does not explicitly mention comparing differences from an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's focus is more on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than on calculating or considering an aspiration level or the differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is about avoiding a significant loss with high probability, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations of the decision reason provided. The individual's focus is on avoiding loss rather than on calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1500 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 1500 Euros for Lottery A, 3000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, and -3000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is 0, positive differences occur for outcomes above 0 Euros. Proceeding to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered Option A as ""ganz gut"" (quite good) and was deterred by the possibility of losing more money with Option B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk of losing more money with Option B, which made them prefer Option A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (perceived goodness of Option A, risk of losing more with Option B). The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it, but they do consider the risk associated with Lottery B, which could imply an implicit consideration of potential losses and gains.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) with the individual’s justification (focusing on the risk of losing more money with Option B). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes risk aversion rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The final assessment is 20, indicating that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it, and their justification focuses more on risk aversion rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 0. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 0 = 3000 for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -3000 - 0 = -3000 for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 2000 - 0 = 2000 for the outcome of Lottery A. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B and compared it to the certain gain of 2000 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk of losing 3000 Euros was too high compared to the small additional amount that could be gained (2000 Euros for sure in Lottery A).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level, but it does involve considering the risk (which could be related to negative differences from an implicit aspiration level) and the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification focuses on the risk of a significant loss being too high compared to a certain, smaller gain, which implies a concern for avoiding negative outcomes (or differences) and preferring a positive, certain outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of an aspiration level or the explicit comparison of outcome differences to such a level as described in the decision reason. However, the concern for risk and the preference for a certain gain over a risky option with potential for higher reward suggest some alignment with the concept of preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (in this case, a certain positive outcome over a gamble with equal chances of a higher positive and a negative outcome). The assessment is closer to 0 because the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not explicitly match the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 ≈ 2666.67 and -3000 - 333.33 ≈ -3333.33; for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 ≈ 666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gaining 1000 Euros from Lottery A and the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 50% probability from Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because the potential loss in Lottery B was deemed too high and too risky, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual focused on the risk of a significant loss and the certainty of a gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or probabilities of being above or below such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual’s justification is based on avoiding a high-risk loss, which aligns with preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (or less negative) but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences). However, the individual's focus on avoiding risk and preferring a certain gain over a risky option with potential for significant loss indirectly resonates with the general idea of preferring positive outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason. Thus, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for positive or less risky outcomes, the specific application and consideration of the aspiration level and its associated probabilities are not mentioned, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (0 + 6000 + (-6000)) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 0 Euros for Lottery A (since its outcome is 0 Euros), 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, and -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given that Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the decision was difficult because 0 Euros (the outcome of Lottery A) is not a good compensation. This implies the individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries. The individual also frames the decision as ""Option B or not play,"" suggesting they considered the potential gain of Lottery B as a significant factor.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual uses the principle ""much money attracts"" (similar to the lottery principle), indicating they were drawn to the potential high reward of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual does consider the outcomes, there is no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual's focus on the potential high reward of Lottery B could implicitly relate to the concept of seeking positive differences from a baseline (in this case, 0 Euros).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B in this case because it offers a chance at a significant positive outcome. The individual's justification, based on the attraction to ""much money,"" aligns with preferring a lottery that offers a significant positive outcome, even if the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities or an aspiration level.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences, their focus on the potential gain of Lottery B and the framing of the decision suggest an implicit consideration of factors that align with the decision reason. However, the lack of explicit discussion about the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences introduces uncertainty.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while there are elements of the individual's decision-making process that align with the decision reason (such as being attracted to the potential high reward of Lottery B), the individual does not explicitly discuss the key components of the decision reason (aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences). Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there is a slight inclination to believe it was not directly applied as defined."
