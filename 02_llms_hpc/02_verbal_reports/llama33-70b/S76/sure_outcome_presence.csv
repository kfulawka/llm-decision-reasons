STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros, while Lottery B does not have a sure outcome but has a very high probability (99%) of winning either 2500 Euros or 2400 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery A and the absence of a sure outcome in Lottery B, along with the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the low probability (1%) of winning nothing in Lottery B and the chance to win 100 Euros more than in Lottery A. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities and potential gains of Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by weighing the low risk of winning nothing against the potential for a higher gain, indicating a willingness to take on a small risk for a potentially greater reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the presence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential gains), it appears the individual focused more on the risk and potential gains of Lottery B rather than the sure outcome of Lottery A.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification (taking a small risk for a potentially greater reward), it seems the individual's decision-making process did not prioritize the presence of a sure outcome as the primary factor.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. However, in the given lotteries (A and B), neither offers a sure outcome. Both lotteries have a chance of winning a specific amount of money and a chance of winning nothing (0 Euros). Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) cannot be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities since neither lottery provides a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the absence of a sure outcome in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the monetary difference between the possible winnings (100 Euros difference between 2500 Euros and 2400 Euros) and the difference in the percentage probabilities of winning (1% difference between 33% and 34% for the respective lotteries).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the lottery with the marginally higher risk (Lottery B, with a 33% chance of winning 2500 Euros) for a noticeably higher potential gain, despite it being only 1% less likely to occur than the alternative (Lottery A, with a 34% chance of winning 2400 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which is not considered by the individual as neither lottery offers a sure outcome. The individual focuses on the difference in potential winnings and the probabilities of those winnings.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is to prefer the lottery with a sure outcome, but since neither lottery has a sure outcome, this rule does not apply directly. The individual’s justification is based on a trade-off between the potential gain and the probability of that gain, not on the presence of a sure outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it is clear that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers a lottery based on the presence of a sure outcome, as neither lottery offers a sure outcome and the individual's deliberation process focused on different aspects (monetary difference and probability difference).

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 3000 Euros, while Lottery B offers a potential outcome of 4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a sure outcome, and Lottery B does not.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the relative heights of the potential winnings and the difference in winnings between the two lotteries, as well as the risk of getting nothing (0 Euros) with a 20% probability in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the risk of getting nothing in Lottery B against the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries, indicating that the risk was not worth the potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the risk of getting nothing in Lottery B and the sure outcome in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, which is consistent with the individual's justification that implies preferring the sure outcome of Lottery A over the riskier Lottery B.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome, as both lotteries have outcomes with probabilities less than 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that neither lottery has a guaranteed outcome, but both have a 0 Euro outcome with a certain probability. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the difference in probabilities (5% less for Lottery A) and the difference in potential winnings (higher for Lottery A). 
Second, the individual justifies the choice based on the consideration that the worst possible outcome in both cases is not a loss but rather a ""Nullsummenspiel"" (a zero-sum game), implying that the individual views the 0 Euro outcome as neutral, focusing on the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (difference in probabilities and potential winnings, and the nature of the worst outcome), it's clear that the individual did not explicitly consider the presence of a sure outcome because neither lottery offers one. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with a sure outcome) to the individual's justification (focusing on potential gain and viewing the worst outcome as neutral), it's evident that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason is inapplicable due to the absence of a sure outcome in both lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 90% probability, which can be considered a near-sure outcome due to its high probability, but it's not a perfectly sure outcome. Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 45% probability, which is not a sure outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the presence and magnitude of sure or near-sure outcomes in both lotteries. Since neither lottery provides a perfectly sure outcome, but Lottery A offers a higher probability of a positive outcome, this information can be derived and summarized as: Lottery A has a near-sure outcome of 3000 Euros, and Lottery B does not have a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the lower probability (less than 50%) of winning in Lottery B. They also consider the magnitude of the potential winnings in both lotteries, noting that the amount in B is twice as high as in A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it is the ""sichere Wahl"" (safe choice) due to the high probability of getting something. They also use the proverb ""Lieber den Spatz in der Hand als die Taube auf dem Dach"" (Better a bird in the hand than a dove on the roof), indicating a preference for a sure or near-sure gain over a potentially higher but less certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability of winning in Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on sure or near-sure outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically looks for a sure outcome, and the individual seems to interpret the high probability in Lottery A as a form of surety.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its high probability of a positive outcome, which they perceive as making it a ""sichere Wahl."" This aligns with the spirit of the decision reason, which prefers a sure outcome, even though Lottery A's outcome is not perfectly sure.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery A and their justification for choosing it as the ""safe"" option closely align with the decision reason's preference for a sure outcome. Although the individual does not strictly follow the decision reason by considering a ""sure"" outcome (since Lottery A's outcome is not perfectly sure), their emphasis on the near-surety of the outcome in Lottery A and the preference for this over the less certain but potentially higher gain in Lottery B indicates a strong alignment with the decision reason's underlying principle. Therefore, the assessment is high but not perfect, as the individual's application of the principle is nuanced and based on the interpretation of ""sicher"" (safe) rather than a strictly sure outcome."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. However, in the given decision problem, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome. Both lotteries have outcomes with very low probabilities of winning and high probabilities of winning nothing (0 Euros). Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) cannot be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, as neither lottery provides a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the very low probabilities of winning in both lotteries A and B and noted that these probabilities are close to each other. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that, given the low probabilities, they wouldn't seriously expect to win anyway, but with Lottery B, they would at least have the potential for a higher winning amount if they were to be positively surprised.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which is not considered by the individual since neither lottery offers a sure outcome. The individual focuses on the probabilities and potential winning amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a sure outcome) does not apply to the individual's justification, as the individual's decision is based on the potential for a higher winning amount in the case of an unexpected win, not on the presence of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A has an 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros and a 20% chance of 0 Euros, while Lottery B has a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery B and the absence of a sure outcome in Lottery A (since it has a mix of outcomes with different probabilities). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to consider the possibility of avoiding debt (or having a ""Nullsummenspiel,"" which translates to a zero-sum game, implying no loss or gain) in Lottery A, even if it's just theoretical, and acknowledges that Lottery B results in a certain, but lesser, debt.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice by referencing the ""Prinzip Hoffnung"" (principle of hope), indicating that the possibility, however small, of not losing money in Lottery A is a decisive factor. This principle seems to prioritize the avoidance of certain loss, even if the probability of avoiding loss is low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (theoretical chance of no loss in Lottery A vs. certain loss in Lottery B). While the individual does consider the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, the focus is more on the hope of avoiding loss in Lottery A rather than strictly preferring the sure outcome.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (hope of avoiding loss). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual seems to prioritize the hope of avoiding loss over the certainty of a lesser loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report suggests that the individual's decision-making process was influenced more by the hope of avoiding any loss, rather than a strict preference for a sure outcome. Since the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B in this case), and the individual's justification does not align with this preference, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a certain probability (80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B). The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a sure outcome, but the probabilities and the potential losses differ. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss amount and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, comparing the amount to be lost with the probability difference.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on weighing the potential loss against the probability of losing, noting that while the probability of loss is slightly higher in Lottery B, the amount to be lost is significantly lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's deliberation focuses more on the balance between potential loss and probability of loss, not explicitly on the presence of a sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based solely on the presence of a sure outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on a trade-off between the amount of potential loss and its probability, not directly on the sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the observation that the individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the presence of a sure outcome. Instead, the individual weighs potential losses against their probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."
9,"auch geringere) Verluste

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. However, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome in the traditional sense (a 100% probability of a specific outcome without any risk). Lottery A offers a -3000 Euros outcome with 90% probability, which can be considered a ""relatively sure"" loss, as mentioned in the verbal report, but it's not a sure outcome in the strict sense. Lottery B offers a -6000 Euros outcome with 45% probability and a 0 Euros outcome with 55% probability, meaning there's a chance to avoid loss, but again, no sure outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason involves identifying if either lottery provides a guaranteed outcome, which in this case, neither does in the absolute sense, but Lottery A's high probability of a loss could be misconstrued as a form of surety.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the probability of avoiding loss in Lottery B, noting it's over 50%, implying a comparison of the risk of loss between the two lotteries. The individual also notes that with Lottery A, there's a relatively secure, albeit smaller, loss. The justification for the choice seems to hinge on the perceived security or risk associated with each lottery's potential outcomes and their probabilities. The individual seems to weigh the certainty of a smaller loss against the possibility of avoiding any loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) with what the individual considered (probabilities of loss and the concept of a ""relatively sure"" loss), there's a partial alignment in that the individual discusses the near-certainty of a loss in Lottery A. However, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a sure outcome) doesn't directly apply since neither lottery offers a sure outcome. The individual's justification focuses more on the relative security of losses and the probability of avoiding loss rather than the presence of a sure outcome. Thus, while the individual's thought process touches upon aspects of certainty and risk, it does not strictly adhere to the decision reason's criteria of preferring a lottery based solely on the presence of a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's deliberation process involves considerations of certainty and risk, which are tangentially related to the concept of sure outcomes, the decision reason as stated (preferring the lottery with a sure outcome) does not directly guide the individual's choice as described in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more nuanced, involving the comparison of potential losses and the probabilities of avoiding loss, rather than a straightforward preference for a sure outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, both have a sure outcome of 0 Euros, but with different probabilities. Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a 99.8% chance of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the presence and probability of the sure outcome (0 Euros) in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of a loss between the two lotteries and decided based on the absolute amount of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the lottery with the smaller absolute loss, considering the difference in loss probabilities to be negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which is present in both lotteries. However, the individual focused on the difference in the probability of a loss and the absolute amount of loss, not directly on the sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a sure outcome, this reason does not directly apply as intended. The individual's justification is based on minimizing loss, given the negligible difference in loss probabilities, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule of preferring a lottery solely because it has a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on the difference in loss probabilities and the preference for the smaller absolute loss does not reflect a consideration for the presence of a sure outcome as the primary decision factor. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
11,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is no sure outcome since the probability of winning 1000 Euros is 50%, and there's an equal chance of winning 0 Euros. For Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. From the description, Lottery B has a sure outcome, and Lottery A does not.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of the outcomes, specifically mentioning a 50/50 chance as akin to a coin toss, and expresses a preference for a ""sichereren Variante"" (safer variant) to avoid the regret of ending up with nothing. This implies the individual is considering the certainty of the outcome as a factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the desire for financial security and a ""Nimm was du jetzt kriegen kannst"" (take what you can get now) mentality, indicating a preference for a guaranteed outcome over a gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty of the outcome and their preference for the ""sichereren Variante"".
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, which matches the individual's justification based on financial security and the desire to avoid the risk of getting nothing.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they both prioritize the presence of a sure outcome.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery A has a sure outcome of -500 Euros, while Lottery B has no sure outcome but a 50% chance of losing -1000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery A and the absence of a sure outcome in Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the guaranteed loss in one of the lotteries and weighs it against the risk of a higher loss but also the possibility of losing nothing in the other lottery. The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the potential upside of avoiding a loss altogether in Lottery B, despite acknowledging the risk of a greater loss. The described deliberation process revolves around the trade-off between a certain loss and a risky outcome with both a potential for a greater loss and a chance of no loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery A) with that considered by the individual (the trade-off between a certain loss and a risky outcome), it appears the individual did consider the aspect of a sure outcome but framed it in terms of ""garantierten Verlust"" (guaranteed loss) rather than a sure outcome being inherently preferable. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, but the individual's justification seems to prioritize the potential benefit of avoiding any loss in Lottery B over the certainty of a loss in Lottery A. This indicates the individual may not have used the decision reason as their primary criterion for making the decision, since they seem to weigh the potential for no loss in Lottery B more heavily than the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is no single sure outcome, but it does offer a range of outcomes including a possibility of winning 2000 Euros with 25% probability, in addition to the 25% chance of winning 4000 Euros and a 50% chance of winning nothing. Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability, meaning it does not have a sure outcome either. However, neither lottery provides a sure outcome in the traditional sense (100% probability of winning a specific amount). The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery, which in this case is absent in both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of winning any amount (""irgendetwas zu gewinnen"") and notes that Lottery A offers a higher probability of winning compared to Lottery B, even though the amounts are lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the higher probability of winning any amount with Lottery A, despite the lower potential winnings compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual instead talks about the probability of winning any amount, not specifically about sure outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, but since neither lottery offers a sure outcome, this rule does not directly apply as intended. The individual's justification, however, is based on the probability of winning, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on sure outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as defined (preferring the lottery with a sure outcome) because the verbal report does not indicate consideration of sure outcomes as the basis for the decision. Instead, the decision was based on the probability of winning any amount.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome, as both have probabilities associated with losing money and neither guarantees a fixed, non-zero outcome with 100% probability. However, the reason can still be conceptually applied by noting that neither lottery has a sure (non-zero) outcome, but it specifically looks for the presence of a sure outcome which is not directly applicable here since both lotteries involve risk. The relevant information from the lotteries is that both involve potential losses and have no guaranteed non-zero payouts.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing money in each lottery and notes that Lottery B has a higher overall probability of losing money (50% chance of losing 2000 Euros and a 25% chance of losing 4000 Euros, compared to a 25% chance of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A). The individual also acknowledges the absolute amount of potential loss in Lottery A is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual focuses on the comparative risk of losing money between the two lotteries, highlighting the higher probability of loss in Lottery B but also recognizing the greater magnitude of potential loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about preferring the lottery with a sure outcome, but since neither lottery offers a sure outcome, this aspect isn't directly addressed by the individual. Instead, the individual discusses probabilities and amounts of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual’s justification is based on the probabilities and magnitudes of losses, not on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which is the core of the decision reason. The individual does not mention preferring a lottery because it has a sure outcome, likely because neither does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the presence of a sure outcome. The individual discusses probabilities of loss and magnitudes of potential losses without referencing the concept of a sure outcome as a deciding factor. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 5 Euros with 100% probability, while Lottery B does not offer a sure outcome greater than 0 Euros (it offers 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a sure outcome of 5 Euros.
- Lottery B does not have a sure outcome greater than 0 Euros but has a very low probability of a high outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the sure outcome of 5 Euros from Lottery A and the low probability of the higher outcome from Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual preferred the sure outcome of 5 Euros (referred to as ""instant gratification"" and something that can be immediately used, such as for a meal) over the low probability of winning a higher amount from Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the sure outcome of Lottery A and the lack of a sure outcome in Lottery B that is greater than 0 Euros, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, and the individual justified their choice by preferring the sure outcome of 5 Euros over the uncertain higher outcome of Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual considered the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and preferred the lottery with the sure outcome, which is exactly what the decision reason prescribes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is a sure outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability. In Lottery B, while there is a very low probability of losing a significant amount (-5000 Euros with 0.1% probability), the outcome of 0 Euros with 99.9% probability is not considered a sure loss but rather a sure outcome of not losing (or gaining) anything in the context of losses. However, the decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which in this context, could be interpreted as preferring the lottery with a guaranteed, though negative, outcome. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of sure outcomes in both lotteries and their values.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential loss in Lottery B despite its low probability and compared it to the small, certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential high loss in Lottery B against the certain, but minor, loss in Lottery A, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the sure loss in Lottery A and the potential for a large loss in Lottery B, aligning with the decision reason's focus on sure outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, and the individual preferred Lottery A because it offered a sure, though small, loss over the risk of a much larger loss in Lottery B, which can be seen as aligning with preferring a sure outcome over an uncertain one.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they preferred the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery A) over the one with a potential for a large loss despite its low probability (Lottery B).

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery A has a sure outcome of 1500 Euros, while Lottery B has no sure outcome but rather a 50% chance of either gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A offers a guaranteed amount, whereas Lottery B does not.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers the potential gain in Lottery B not to be high enough to outweigh the perceived danger of high debt and the guaranteed security of Lottery A. The individual also mentions not wanting to regret their decision later. The information considered by the individual includes the potential outcomes of both lotteries, the risk associated with Lottery B, and the security of Lottery A. The individual's justification for their choice seems to prioritize avoiding risk and ensuring a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the presence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (the risk, potential outcomes, and guaranteed security), it appears that the individual did consider the aspect of a sure outcome, specifically highlighting the security of Lottery A. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, which aligns with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A based on its guaranteed security and the desire to avoid the risk of debt associated with Lottery B. This suggests that the individual likely used the decision reason to make their decision, as their reasoning process emphasized the importance of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros with 100% probability, while Lottery B has no sure outcome, offering 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a sure outcome, and Lottery B does not.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference in winnings between the two lotteries (implied by ""Der Gewinnunterscheid von A zu B"") and the high risk of a significant loss on the B side (""hohes Risiko von hohem Verlust auf der B-Seite""). They also consider the presence of a sure win in Lottery A (""eines sicheren Gewinns"").
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be drawn to Lottery A because the difference in potential winnings is enough to compensate for the high risk of loss in Lottery B, and the sure win in A is tempting (""um das hohe Risiko... zu kompensieren und mich angesichts eines sicheren Gewinns in Versuchung zu führen"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, which is directly mentioned by the individual as a factor (""eines sicheren Gewinns""). Thus, there is alignment in the information considered.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, and the individual's justification for potentially choosing Lottery A (the one with a sure outcome) is influenced by the presence of this sure outcome, among other factors. The individual's reasoning seems to align with preferring the sure outcome as a significant factor, though not the sole factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report indicates consideration of the sure outcome in Lottery A as a significant factor, aligning with the decision reason's preference for lotteries with sure outcomes. However, the report also mentions other factors (e.g., the difference in winnings, the risk of loss), suggesting the decision was not based solely on the presence of a sure outcome. Thus, while it is likely the decision reason played a role, it is not the only consideration, leading to a high but not absolute certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 1000 Euros, while Lottery B does not offer a sure outcome but rather a 50% chance of either gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery and its value. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the security of a guaranteed, relatively high win (referring to Lottery A's 1000 Euros with 100% probability) as more appealing than the gamble of potentially incurring high debts with a significant probability (50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B). The individual's justification for their choice emphasizes the importance of a guaranteed outcome over the potential higher reward in Lottery B, which is not deemed attractive enough given the risk of significant loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the presence of a sure outcome and its value) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual also focuses on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A as a key factor. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, which aligns with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because of its guaranteed win. The individual's emphasis on the ""Sicherheit eines garantierten, relativ hohen Gewinns"" (security of a guaranteed, relatively high win) directly corresponds with the decision reason's preference for a lottery with a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A has outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, both with 50% probability, meaning there is no sure outcome. Lottery B offers 0 Euros with 100% probability, which is a sure outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: Lottery A has no sure outcome, and Lottery B has a sure outcome of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50/50 chance of incurring significant debt with Lottery A, likening it to a coin toss, and noted the absence of loss risk but also the absence of a gain chance in the other option.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""sicherere Variante"" (safer option) to avoid the risk of loss, even though it meant forgoing the chance of a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome in each lottery) with that considered by the individual (risk of significant debt in Lottery A and the safer, loss-free nature of the other option), we see that the individual did consider the aspect of risk and surety, which aligns with the decision reason's focus.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the safer option to avoid loss), we observe that the individual's justification aligns with the decision reason's preference for a sure outcome, as the individual prioritized avoiding a potential loss over the possibility of a gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of the sure outcome and the decision to choose the option without risk of loss directly align with the decision reason's criteria, indicating certain use of the decision reason."
