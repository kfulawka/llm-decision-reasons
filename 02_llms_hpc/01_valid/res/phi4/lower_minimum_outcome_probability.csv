0,"of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome.assistantTo solve this problem, we will follow the outlined steps to determine which lottery the decision reason prefers.

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

- We need to identify the minimum outcome for each lottery and the probability of that outcome occurring.
- For Lottery A:
  - The outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros.
  - The minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
  - The probability of receiving 0 Euros is 1%.
- For Lottery B:
  - The only outcome is 2400 Euros.
  - The minimum outcome is 2400 Euros.
  - The probability of receiving 2400 Euros is 100%.

The relevant information derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities is:
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 1%.
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.

Since we can derive the necessary information (the probability of the minimum outcome) for both lotteries, we can proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome.
- For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 1%.
- For Lottery B, the probability of the minimum outcome (2400 Euros) is 100%.

Since 1% (Lottery A) is less than 100% (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
