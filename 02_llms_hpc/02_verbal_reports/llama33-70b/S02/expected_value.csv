STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) is calculated as follows:
EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros.
For Lottery A, the expected value is simply 2400 Euros since it has a 100% chance of yielding 2400 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the low probability of losing (0 Euros) in Lottery B and the possibility of gaining more than in Lottery A (the ""möglichen 100€"", which refers to the difference between the potential gain of 2500 Euros in Lottery B and the guaranteed 2400 Euros in Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the chance of losing is very low and the possibility of gaining an extra 100 Euros is not very unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's considerations focus on the low probability of losing and the potential for extra gain, not explicitly on expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification does not mention comparing expected values or making a choice based on which lottery has a higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the expected values of the lotteries or made their decision based on which lottery had a higher expected value, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the amounts of the two lotteries (100 Euros) and the difference in their probabilities (1 percentage point).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risky option), suggesting they preferred the option that offers a potentially higher reward despite its slightly lower probability of winning, because the differences in both the amounts and probabilities were not considered large.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered differences in amounts and probabilities but did not directly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" suggests they chose Lottery B, but their reasoning is based on the relative risks and rewards rather than explicitly on the expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the expected values of the lotteries or directly applying the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided does not clearly indicate that the decision was made based on expected values. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a desire for security, not wanting to gamble with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially considering the high sums involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on a desire for security and not wanting to risk losing, emphasizing the importance of having a guaranteed amount rather than risking it for a potentially higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (security, risk aversion, guaranteed amount): The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention the expected values of the lotteries but focus on the security aspect and the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring security and a guaranteed amount): The decision reason would lead to choosing Lottery B due to its higher expected value, but the individual's justification suggests a preference for Lottery A due to its guaranteed payout, which aligns with risk aversion rather than maximizing expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report emphasizes security and risk aversion as the basis for their decision, without mentioning or implying a consideration of the expected values of the lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

in dem Fall potentiell höherer Gewinn bei Lotterie B angelockt, da Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied von 5% nicht so groß erscheint

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B, indicating they are looking at the outcomes. The mention of the 5% difference in probabilities suggests they are also considering the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to hinge on the comparison of the potential gains and the perceived significance of the probability difference, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probability differences), it appears the individual is considering related but not exactly the same information. The individual discusses the potential for higher gain and the difference in probabilities without explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (focused on the potential for higher gain and the perceived significance of probability differences), it seems the individual's decision process does not directly align with calculating and comparing expected values as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), their justification does not directly reflect the calculation and comparison of expected values as specified by the decision reason, suggesting it is unlikely but not entirely impossible that the decision reason was used."
5,"der anderen Seite nicht locken konnte; außerdem war bei B bschreckend, dass es unter 50% waren

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as EV = (probability of winning * amount to win). For Lottery A, EV_A = 0.9 * 3000 = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV_B = 0.45 * 6000 = 2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual was attracted to the 90% probability of winning in Lottery A and was deterred by the less than 50% probability of winning in Lottery B. They also mention the ""doppelt so hohe Gewinn"" (double the winnings) of Lottery B, indicating they considered the amount to win in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of winning was very enticing, and the higher potential win of Lottery B was not enough to sway them, partly due to its lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities and the amounts to win separately, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same expected value. The individual, however, preferred Lottery A based on its higher probability of winning and was deterred by the lower probability of winning in Lottery B, not explicitly because of a comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the probabilities and the absolute amounts to win, rather than the expected values of the lotteries. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would not provide a basis for preferring one over the other, but the individual did express a preference based on other criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"sowieso verschwindend gering war das Gefühl, dass es relativ egal ist und ich dann ja auch auf den höheren Gewinn setzen kann

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries are equal in terms of expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the probability of winning is very low (""verschwindend gering""), which suggests they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that because the probability of winning is very low, it feels relatively indifferent (""relativ egal""), and thus they decided to go for the higher win (""höheren Gewinn setzen""). This indicates the individual focused on the potential gain when probabilities were perceived as low and similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the amount of potential gain). The individual did not explicitly mention comparing the expected values but focused on the high potential gain due to the low probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the higher potential gain due to low probabilities). The decision reason is based on a quantitative comparison of expected values, which are equal in this case, leading to indifference. The individual, however, chose based on the potential for a higher gain, not explicitly on expected values.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. Instead, they made a choice based on the perceived indifference due to low probabilities and the appeal of a higher potential gain. This approach does not align with calculating and comparing expected values as the decision reason suggests.

7,"attraktiv ist, erschienen mir die 20% für icht-Verlust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (-3000 * 1) = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are -3200 Euros for Lottery B and -3000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the definitive loss of Lottery A and the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B, as well as the difference in potential loss between the two lotteries (1000 Euros more loss in Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by weighing the attractiveness of avoiding a definitive loss against the potential for a greater loss in Lottery B, suggesting that the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B was not worth the additional 1000 Euros of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, which involve calculations of probabilities and outcomes. The individual considered probabilities (20% chance of no loss) and outcomes (definitive loss, potential for greater loss), but it's not clear if they explicitly calculated or compared expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between the certainty of loss and the potential for a greater loss, rather than explicitly stating a preference based on expected value. However, the individual's consideration of the 20% chance of no loss and the additional 1000 Euros of potential loss in Lottery B implies some form of comparison that could be related to expected value, albeit not explicitly stated in those terms.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered elements related to the decision reason (probabilities and outcomes), there is no clear indication that they explicitly calculated or compared expected values as the decision reason dictates. The individual's justification is more intuitive and based on the perceived value of avoiding a definitive loss versus the potential for a greater loss, rather than a straightforward application of expected value comparison. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but leaning towards it not being used as the primary basis for the decision."
8,"Verlustsumme entschieden (vermutlich weil 4000€ doch erschreckend viel klingt)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -750 Euros for Lottery A and -800 Euros for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a higher expected value (-750 Euros is greater than -800 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 5% difference (which likely refers to the difference in probabilities of losing between the two lotteries) and the absolute amounts of potential losses (4000 Euros being ""erschreckend viel"" or frighteningly large). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the smaller loss sum, implying they chose Lottery A because the potential loss of 3000 Euros was considered less severe than the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, the individual focuses on the difference in loss amounts and the severity of the potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A but justified this choice based on the smaller potential loss, not explicitly on the expected value.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (both prefer Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual used expected values as the basis for their decision. The report suggests a focus on the absolute amounts of potential losses rather than a calculated comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision was made based on the expected values of the lotteries. The justification provided by the individual is more aligned with a simplistic comparison of potential losses rather than a calculated consideration of expected outcomes."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and their associated probabilities, indicating a focus on the potential losses and their likelihoods. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the relatively lower probability of losing (though the loss is higher), specifically mentioning that the probability of loss in Lottery A is ""unter 50%"" (under 50%), which seems to be a key factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, with a specific focus on the probability of loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected value in their deliberation as described.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (focusing on the probability of loss being under 50% for Lottery A), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, especially since both lotteries have the same expected value but the individual chose based on a different criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -6 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A and finds it frightening, also noting that the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries is minimal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus is on the potential loss and the minimal difference in probabilities, without explicitly discussing the expected value or a systematic comparison of the two lotteries based on their expected outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential loss and the difference in probabilities, not on the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification, however, is based on the fear of loss and the minimal probability difference, not on comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, as there is no mention of calculating or comparing expected values in the verbal report.

11,", erscheint mir hier attraktiver, sicher Geld zu bekommen (das zusätzliche Guthaben hat mich in diesem Fall nicht risikobereiter gemacht)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 * 1) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are equal in this case.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the attractiveness of receiving a certain amount of money. The individual mentions that getting ""sicher Geld"" (secure money) appears more attractive, implying a preference for the certain outcome. The justification for the choice seems to be based on the certainty of the outcome rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. The individual also mentions that the additional credit did not make them more risk-tolerant.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome, attractiveness of secure money), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not seem to match the individual's justification for the choice (preferring the certain outcome). However, since the expected values of the two lotteries are equal, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries, which might align with the individual's consideration of the certainty of the outcome as a deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely, but not entirely certain, that the decision reason was used by the individual. The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected values suggests that a different decision process was used. However, the equal expected values of the two lotteries mean that the decision reason would not have led to a clear preference for one lottery over the other, which might be seen as indirectly aligning with the individual's consideration of the certainty of the outcome."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward: -500 Euros with 100% probability, so EV_A = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the calculation is: EV_B = (-1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = -500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional balance, possibly leading to a preference for the riskier option B due to being more risk-seeking. They also mention that having a 100% loss (Option A) is not attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the attractiveness of not having a guaranteed loss and possibly by their risk attitude, but they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (uncertainty about current balance relevance, influence of additional balance, risk attitude, attractiveness of not having a guaranteed loss): The individual does not mention expected values explicitly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (influenced by risk attitude and the attractiveness of avoiding a guaranteed loss): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there's no mention of comparing expected values to make the decision.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason (comparing expected values) to make their decision. Their deliberation process, as described, focuses more on risk attitude and the psychological impact of a guaranteed loss rather than a numerical comparison of expected outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something in each lottery and the height of the potential gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning something was higher, despite the potential gains being lower than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning and height of gains): The individual did not explicitly mention considering the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prefer the lottery with the higher probability of winning something): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritized the probability of winning over the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report indicates that they prioritized the probability of winning something over the potential gains, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, and the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being uncertain and having difficulty with decisions involving losses, being deterred by the high value of -6000 Euros in Lottery A, and acknowledging that losses are more probable in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the aversion to high losses and the higher probability of any loss in Lottery B, rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (difficulty with losses, high value of -6000 Euros, probability of losses): The individual's considerations do not directly reflect a calculation or consideration of the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (aversion to high losses and higher probability of losses in one lottery): The individual's justification does not indicate a preference based on expected value but rather on loss aversion and probability of losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on comparing the expected values of the lotteries, was used to make the decision. The focus on loss aversion and the difficulty with decisions involving losses, rather than a direct consideration of expected values, suggests that a different decision-making process was employed."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value is 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B and seems to consider the risk aspect of choosing Lottery B versus the certainty of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies not choosing Lottery B due to the very small probability of the large gain, implying that this low probability was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B, which indirectly relates to the expected value calculation but focuses more on the risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the expected values are equal, it would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, leans towards avoiding the risk associated with Lottery B due to its low probability of a large gain, rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention comparing expected values or explicitly state a preference based on higher expected value, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus on the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B and the risk aspect suggests that while the individual considered factors that influence expected value, their decision-making process was more influenced by risk aversion than a straightforward comparison of expected values. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward: -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is -5000 Euros * 0.1% + 0 Euros * 99.9% = -5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the monetary outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the extremely low probability of loss in Lottery B and compares it with the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certainty of a small loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities influenced their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which are based on the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes, aligning with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. However, the individual's justification focuses on the comparison of the low probability of a significant loss versus a certain small loss, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of expected values. The individual's reasoning seems more aligned with an intuitive or qualitative assessment rather than a strict calculation of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the key components that would influence an expected value calculation (outcomes and probabilities), but their justification does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, it focuses on a more qualitative comparison of risks, suggesting that while the individual considered relevant information, they may not have used the expected value as the primary decision rule. Thus, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice, but there's a slight possibility it played a role in their deliberation, hence a score of 20."
17,"zum Beispiel vor ein paar Durchgängen; Lieber den kleineren Gewinn auf der haben -Seite, Verlust zu 50% bei anderer Lotterie zu risikoreich

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (1500 * 1) = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the risk of loss (Verlust zu 50% bei anderer Lotterie zu risikoreich), which implies they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, particularly focusing on the risk aspect of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers the smaller, certain gain (Lieber den kleineren Gewinn auf der haben-Seite), indicating a preference for a guaranteed outcome over a risky one, even if the risky option has a potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and preference for a certain gain). While the individual does consider aspects of the lotteries (risk and certainty), there is no direct mention of calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preference for a certain, smaller gain due to the risk associated with the other option). The individual's justification aligns with preferring a certain gain (Lottery B) over a risky option (Lottery A), which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A. However, the individual's reasoning is based on risk aversion rather than an explicit comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly indicate the use of expected values to make the decision. Instead, it highlights a preference for certainty over risk, which happens to align with the decision reason's outcome in this case but does not demonstrate the application of the expected value rule as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of the expected value decision reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 2000 * 1 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. Thus, the relevant information is: Lottery A has an expected value of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has an expected value of 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""Reiz des definitiven Gewinns"" (the appeal of a definite win), which suggests they are considering the certainty of the outcome of one of the lotteries. They also mention ""keine Lust, mit mehr Risiko zu spielen"" (no desire to play with more risk), indicating they are considering the risk associated with each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to be based on the appeal of a certain win and the desire to avoid more risk, especially after experiencing losses in previous rounds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the win and risk). The individual does not explicitly mention expected values but focuses on the certainty of the win and the risk, which indirectly relates to the concept of expected value since a certain win (Lottery B) has a higher expected value than a risky option with a potentially higher loss (Lottery A).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (appeal of a definite win and avoiding more risk). While the individual's justification does not directly mention expected values, the preference for a certain win over a risky option aligns with preferring a higher expected value (in this case, 2000 Euros for Lottery B over 0 Euros for Lottery A), as the certain win (Lottery B) indeed has a higher expected value.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with the decision reason in terms of outcome preference (preferring the certain win, which corresponds to the higher expected value), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering expected values. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not a direct match.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice and some aspects of their reasoning process align with the decision reason (preferring the higher expected value), the explicit consideration and calculation of expected values as the basis for the decision are not clearly stated in the verbal report. Thus, there is uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used, but it seems unlikely based on the information provided."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1000 Euros * 100% = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain in Lottery A compared to the potential loss in Lottery B, noting the probability of winning in Lottery B is only 50%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery A over the potential higher but uncertain gain (and significant loss) in Lottery B, considering the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, which directly involves the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered the outcomes and the probability of winning in Lottery B, which aligns with the components needed to calculate expected value, though they did not explicitly mention calculating expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual preferred Lottery A because the certain gain was more attractive than the risky option of Lottery B, which implies a preference for a more secure, though potentially lower, gain over a riskier, potentially higher gain. This reasoning aligns with preferring a higher expected value when the certain gain (Lottery A) has a positive expected value and the risky option (Lottery B) has a zero expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not explicitly mention calculating expected values but focuses on the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery A over the risky outcomes of Lottery B, considering the probabilities. This implies an implicit consideration of the expected outcomes, aligning with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher expected value. However, since the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention expected values, the assessment is not 100. The reasoning provided in the verbal report, though, strongly suggests that the individual's decision was influenced by considerations akin to those of the decision reason, thus the assessment is higher than 50."

6000 zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen, da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner; einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 * 1 = 0. Thus, both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it indicates that the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""6000 [is] zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen"" which translates to ""6000 is too large a sum to gamble with,"" indicating they are considering the magnitude of the potential loss or gain. They also mention ""da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner"" which means ""since otherwise gains are smaller,"" suggesting a consideration of the potential outcomes in relation to their magnitude and perhaps frequency. Lastly, ""einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung"" translates to ""taking a break seems okay,"" which might imply a preference for avoiding risk or taking a safe option.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the magnitude of potential gains and losses and the idea of taking a break or avoiding risk, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of potential gains and losses, risk avoidance): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the expected values of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding large potential losses, considering the magnitude of outcomes): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual's justification seems to prioritize risk avoidance over expected value calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. Instead, their focus was on the magnitude of potential outcomes and avoiding risk, which does not align with the decision reason's emphasis on expected value calculation."
