   - Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.
   - The relevant information can be derived: Lottery A has a zero outcome, while Lottery B does not.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - Lottery B has no zero outcome, while Lottery A has a zero outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason requires evaluating whether there are zero outcomes in the lotteries.
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome with 67% probability.
   - Lottery B has a zero outcome with 66% probability.
   - Both lotteries have zero outcomes present; thus, the relevant information can be derived.

2. Summarize the information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason.
   - Lottery A: 0 Euros with 67% probability (Zero outcome present)
   - Lottery B: 0 Euros with 66% probability (Zero outcome present)

3. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - Since both lotteries have zero outcomes, the decision reason does not prefer one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
- Lottery A has a zero outcome (0 Euros) with a 20% probability.
- Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.
Based on the information given, we can derive whether each lottery has a zero outcome. Therefore, the decision reason can be strictly applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule:
- The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
- Lottery B does not have a zero outcome while Lottery A does.
Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The relevant information for the decision reason is whether each lottery includes a zero outcome.
   - Lottery A: 0 Euros with 80% probability.
   - Lottery B: 0 Euros with 75% probability.
   - Both lotteries have a zero outcome.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - By the decision reason, the lottery without a zero outcome is preferred.
   - Since both Lottery A and Lottery B include a zero outcome, neither is preferred according to the reason.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- Lottery A has a 55% probability of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 10% probability of 0 Euros.
- Both lotteries have a zero outcome.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Since both lotteries have a zero outcome, the decision reason cannot strictly prefer one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. 
The decision reason specifies a preference for lotteries that do not have a zero outcome. 
First, check if any of the lotteries (A or B) offer a zero outcome.
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 6000 Euros (0.1% probability) and 0 Euros (99.9% probability).
- Lottery B has two outcomes: 3000 Euros (0.2% probability) and 0 Euros (99.8% probability).
Both lotteries A and B have a zero outcome.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
Since both lotteries have a zero outcome, the decision reason cannot prefer one lottery over the other based on the given rule.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A outcomes: -4000 Euros with 80% probability, 0 Euros with 20% probability
   - Lottery B outcomes: -3000 Euros with 100% probability
   - Relevant information: The presence of a zero outcome in each lottery.

2. According to the decision reason, the reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome (20% probability).
   - Lottery B does not have a zero outcome (100% probability of -3000 Euros).

Applying the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred as it does not have a zero outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied:
   - Lottery A outcomes: -4000 Euros with 20% probability, 0 Euros with 80% probability. Contains a zero outcome.
   - Lottery B outcomes: -3000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability. Contains a zero outcome.
   - Based on the decision reason, we need to check if there is a presence of a zero outcome in each lottery.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - According to the reason, we prefer the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - However, both lotteries A and B have 0 Euros as one of the outcomes. This indicates that both lotteries have the zero outcome present.
   - Since both lotteries contain a zero outcome, the decision reason does not show a preference for either lottery.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
    - Lottery A has an outcome of 0 Euros with a 55% probability.
    - Lottery B has an outcome of 0 Euros with a 10% probability.
    - The decision reason is concerned with the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
    - Both lotteries have a zero outcome.
    - Therefore, the relevant information about the presence of zero outcomes can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
    - Since both lotteries A and B have a zero outcome, the reason does not prefer one lottery over another based on the zero outcomes.
    - Therefore, the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason concerns whether or not a zero outcome is present in the lotteries.
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome with 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B has a zero outcome with 99.8% probability.
   - Both lotteries have a zero outcome, so the relevant information can be derived.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery without a zero outcome should be preferred.
   - In this case, both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome.
   - Therefore, the decision reason does not have a clear preference between the two lotteries.

  - 500 Euros with 100% probability
- Relevant information to the decision reason: the presence of a zero outcome in the lotteries.
  - Lottery A has a zero outcome (0 Euros with 50% probability).
  - Lottery B does not have a zero outcome (500 Euros with 100% probability).
- The relevant information about the lotteries has been derived successfully.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
- Lottery A has a zero outcome.
- Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.
- Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner:
   - Lottery A outcomes: -1000 Euros (50%), 0 Euros (50%)
   - Lottery B outcomes: -500 Euros (100%)
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome (0 Euros), while Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.
   - The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.
   
2. Apply the decision reason:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome, and Lottery B does not.
   - Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied:
- Lottery A: 
  - Outcomes: 6000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability.
  - Relevant information: Includes a zero outcome.

- Lottery B:
  - Outcomes: 4000 Euros with 25% probability, 2000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 50% probability.
  - Relevant information: Includes a zero outcome.

As both lotteries include a zero outcome, the relevant information required by the decision reason is derived.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason:
- The reason specifies a preference for the lottery without a zero outcome. 
- Since both Lottery A and Lottery B include zero outcomes, neither lottery is preferred strictly following the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. First, assess the information relevant to the decision reason for each lottery.

For Lottery A:
- Outcomes: -6000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Probabilities: 25% for -6000 Euros, 75% for 0 Euros

For Lottery B:
- Outcomes: -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Probabilities: 25% for -4000 Euros, 25% for -2000 Euros, 50% for 0 Euros

2. Apply the decision reason to decide based on the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A has a zero outcome (0 Euros with 75% probability).
- Lottery B also has a zero outcome (0 Euros with 50% probability).

Since both lotteries include a zero outcome, according to the decision reason, the preference should be for the lottery without a zero outcome. However, since both lotteries have a zero outcome, this requirement likewise leads to indifference.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly.
   The decision reason is based on the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. 
   - Lottery A has an outcome of 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B has no zero outcome; it offers 5 Euros with 100% probability.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
   The reason prefers the lottery without a zero outcome. 
   - Lottery A has a zero outcome.
   - Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A has an outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%.
   - Lottery B does not have an outcome of 0 Euros; it has a single outcome of -5 Euros with a probability of 100%.
   - The decision reason is applicable since it concerns the presence of zero outcomes in the lotteries.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - According to the decision reason, the preferred lottery is the one without a zero outcome.
   - Lottery A contains a zero outcome (0 Euros with 99.9% probability).
   - Lottery B does not contain a zero outcome (only -5 Euros with 100% probability).

Therefore, following the decision reason's rule strictly leads us to prefer Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A outcomes: 3000 Euros (50%) and -3000 Euros (50%)
   - Lottery B outcomes: 1500 Euros (100%)
   - Relevant information: Presence or absence of a zero outcome in each lottery.
   - Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a zero outcome.
    
2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A non-zero outcomes: 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros
   - Lottery B non-zero outcome: 1500 Euros
   - Since both lotteries lack a zero outcome, the decision reason does not prefer one over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Evaluate whether the decision reason can be applied strictly to this decision problem. The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. 

- Lottery A offers outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, which means it does not contain a zero outcome.
- Lottery B offers an outcome of 2000 Euros, which means it also does not contain a zero outcome.

Given that neither lottery includes a zero outcome, it means that the relevant information for the decision reason (the presence of a zero outcome) cannot help differentiate between Lottery A and Lottery B. Therefore, the decision reason cannot be applied strictly.

Step 2: Since the relevant information cannot be derived (neither lottery has a zero outcome), the decision reason is indifferent between lottery A and lottery B. 

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the relevant information:
   - Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 50% probability, -3000 Euros with 50% probability.
   - Lottery B: 1000 Euros with 100% probability.
   - Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a zero outcome.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a zero outcome.
   - Since neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a zero outcome, the decision reason does not have a basis for preferring one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A has outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, with no zero outcome.
   - Lottery B has an outcome of 0 Euros.
   - The relevant information here is the presence or absence of zero outcomes in each lottery.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery without a zero outcome is preferred.
   - Lottery A does not have a zero outcome, while Lottery B has a zero outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
