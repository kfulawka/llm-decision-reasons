STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 2500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that they chose Lottery A because no losses are possible (which seems to be a misunderstanding since there is a 1% chance of losing in Lottery A) and because they perceive it as having a higher overall payout.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification is based on the perceived absence of losses and the higher overall payout, not directly mentioning the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (absence of losses and higher overall payout), we see that the individual does not directly consider the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason does.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification (focusing on no losses and higher overall payout), it's clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's reasoning does not explicitly address the differences between outcomes within each lottery as the basis for their decision.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. Since both lotteries have different maximum outcomes and the same minimum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries and the difference in the potential winnings. The individual mentions that the probabilities are ""ca. gleich"" (approximately equal), which suggests they considered the probabilities but did not focus on the exact differences. They also considered the potential for higher winnings in one of the lotteries.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the higher potential winnings in Lottery B when a win occurs, and the absence of potential losses. The individual initially felt indifferent but decided based on the potential for a higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused more on the potential for higher winnings and the absence of losses rather than the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the potential for a higher payout and no losses), it seems the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual chose Lottery B, which has a larger difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, contrary to what the decision reason would suggest.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of each lottery, the probability of not winning in Lottery A (20%), and the guaranteed but lower payout in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential gain is higher, despite the risk of winning nothing, which they perceived as low due to the 20% probability. They also compared the guaranteed payout in Lottery B, finding it lower than the potential gain in Lottery A, thus opting for the riskier option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the potential gain, the probability of not winning, and the comparison of potential gains between the two lotteries, not explicitly mentioning the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes as a deciding factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual, however, chose Lottery A based on the potential for a higher gain, not because of the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned as a factor in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the potential for a higher gain and the perceived low risk of not winning, indicating that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that in both cases, no loss can be incurred, implying they considered the minimum outcomes (0 Euros for both lotteries). They also mention that the probabilities do not differ strongly and that the gain (or win) in Lottery A is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by mentioning the higher gain in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, despite acknowledging that the probabilities do not differ significantly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration. The individual considered the fact that no loss can occur and compared the gains, but did not discuss the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on its higher gain, not the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, was used to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference, which in this case is Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that they chose Lottery A because no losses are possible (which seems to be a misunderstanding since both lotteries have a possibility of 0 Euros, implying a loss or no gain), and they are willing to take the riskier path for a higher payout. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification revolves around the absence of losses and the willingness to take on more risk for a higher potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes between the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (no losses and higher payout). The individual does not explicitly mention considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification (choosing the riskier option for a higher payout). The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its smaller outcome difference, but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different rationale.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the potential for higher rewards and the perception of no losses, which does not match the criteria of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Ich habe mich für B entschieden, da hier keine Verluste möglich sind und ich daher den Weg, mit einer zwar etwas unsicheren, aber höheren Auszahlung wählen würde.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the aspect of ""no losses"" (keine Verluste möglich) in Lottery B, implying they looked at the minimum outcomes of both lotteries. The justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the potential for a higher payout despite some uncertainty, not directly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with what the individual considered (potential for no losses and higher payouts), there seems to be a partial overlap in that both involve considering the outcomes, but the individual's focus was not on the differences between the outcomes within each lottery. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on the absence of losses and the potential for higher payouts). Therefore, the decision reason does not seem to be the primary basis for the individual's choice.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual chose Lottery A because the loss is smaller compared to Lottery B. The individual mentions that the loss in Lottery A occurs with 100% probability, but they prefer this certain loss over the riskier approach of Lottery B, which has a higher potential loss, even though it's not guaranteed. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the comparison of losses and the preference for a certain outcome over a riskier one.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with the information considered by the individual (comparison of losses and preference for certainty), it appears that the individual considered the outcomes of each lottery but framed their decision in terms of loss rather than the range of outcomes. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes) aligns with the individual's justification (preferring the certain loss of Lottery A over the potential higher loss of Lottery B) in the sense that both lead to the selection of Lottery A. However, the individual's reasoning is more focused on the avoidance of a higher potential loss and the preference for certainty rather than explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is |0 - (-4000)| = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is |0 - (-3000)| = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference, which would be Lottery B. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are similar but notes the possibility of losses, indicating they considered the potential outcomes (losses) of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on choosing the lottery with the lesser loss, implying they compared the potential losses of both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which translates to comparing the losses in this context since the maximum outcome for both is 0 Euros. The individual considered the losses, aligning with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference (or lesser loss in this case), which is Lottery B. The individual justified their choice by selecting the lottery with the lesser loss, which also points to Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on the difference between outcomes (lesser loss in this scenario) and the rule to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference (lesser loss). This alignment suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since there's no positive outcome, we consider 0 as the maximum in the context of ""maximum and minimum outcome"" which seems to refer to the absolute values of the outcomes or their impact) and the minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros, but since the actual outcomes are -3000 and 0, the difference is 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss (receiving 0 Euros) and the magnitude of the possible loss in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of not incurring a loss is higher, and the magnitude of the possible loss is considered ""geringer"" (smaller), which seems to be a misunderstanding since the loss in Lottery A is actually larger.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a criterion for the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (3000 Euros difference) over Lottery A (6000 Euros difference). However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule; instead, they mention the probability of not incurring a loss and misinterpret the magnitude of the loss.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. Since these differences can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting they are approximately equal, and the heights of the potential losses, recognizing that the loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the comparison of the loss amounts in the two lotteries, specifically that the loss in B is doppelt so hoch (twice as high) as in A, which led to their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and loss amounts), it appears the individual focused on the loss amounts, which aligns with considering the outcomes but specifically highlights the negative aspect.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery A because the loss is not twice as high as in B), the individual's reasoning is consistent with preferring a smaller loss, which indirectly reflects the decision reason's emphasis on outcome differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report aligns with the logic of the decision reason, which emphasizes the importance of the difference between outcomes within a lottery. The individual's focus on the loss amount and the comparative analysis between the two lotteries suggests they utilized a reasoning process that is consistent with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of no losses (or a neutral outcome) in Lottery B and the fact that the potential gain in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a higher potential gain without considering losses, but rather a ""neutraler Ausgang"" (neutral outcome), and is willing to take the risk for the higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential gain and the concept of a ""neutral"" outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different rationale, emphasizing the potential for a higher gain and a neutral outcome rather than the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not a factor mentioned in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is consistently -500 Euros, meaning the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is 0 Euros (since there is no variation). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are: 
- Lottery B has a difference of 1000 Euros between its maximum and minimum outcomes.
- Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of still having a chance to win 0 Euros with Lottery B, as opposed to the certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance to end up with 0 Euros, as opposed to the guaranteed loss of -500 Euros in Lottery A. The focus is on the potential to avoid loss rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the chance of avoiding a loss rather than comparing the ranges of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is centered around the possibility of not losing (ending up with 0 Euros) in Lottery B, not the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning (erzielen einen Gewinn) in each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning is higher overall compared to Lottery B, where the chance of winning is only 25%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery, while the individual considered the overall probability of winning. These are different aspects of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning. The individual does not mention the differences between outcomes as a factor in their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of earning 0 Euros and the overall probability of incurring a loss in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher probability of earning 0 Euros and perceived a higher overall probability of incurring a loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's consideration was based on the probabilities of specific outcomes and overall loss probabilities, not directly on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes (which would be Lottery A), but the individual's justification does not mention this aspect. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the probability of earning 0 Euros and the perceived probability of incurring a loss.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly consider the decision reason's criteria (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) when making their choice. The focus was on the probability of certain outcomes rather than the range of outcomes.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 5 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A to be very low (""nahezu null""), which made it seem unrealistic, and thus preferred the certain payout of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery B because it offers a certain, albeit small, gain, as opposed to the very low probability of a significant gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's reasoning. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning and the certainty of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (difference of 0 Euros). The individual preferred Lottery B but based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. The individual's decision was based on the perceived realism of the probability of winning and the preference for a certain outcome, rather than the specific rule of minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcomes are -5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of earning 0 Euros in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of the high probability of not losing anything (earning 0 Euros) and viewed the certain loss in Lottery B as undesirable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the probability of earning 0 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (difference of 0 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing the high probability of not losing as the reason, not the difference in outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason emphasizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the probability of outcomes and the desirability of avoiding a certain loss, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery B has a difference of 6000 Euros, and Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the possibility of loss or gain in Lottery B, noting that both outcomes are equally likely and of the same magnitude. They also considered the certainty of gain in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to Lottery B, which has an equal chance of a significant loss or gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the certainty of gain in A and the equal likelihood of loss or gain in B). While the individual's consideration of the certainty of gain in A and the risk in B aligns with the concept of evaluating outcomes, they specifically mention the equal likelihood and magnitude of loss or gain in B, which indirectly relates to the range of outcomes but does not explicitly discuss the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason does.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the certain gain over the risk of loss). The individual's justification can be seen as consistent with the decision reason's rule, as preferring a certain gain (Lottery A, with a difference of 0) over a lottery with a significant risk of loss (Lottery B, with a large difference between outcomes) aligns with preferring smaller outcome differences. However, the individual does not explicitly mention the comparison of outcome differences as their reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to the risky nature of Lottery B, aligns with the principle of avoiding large differences between maximum and minimum outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention the comparison of the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for the decision, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a strong indication that the decision reason might have influenced the choice, it is not explicitly stated, leading to a degree of uncertainty. Hence, the assessment is 70, indicating a likelihood that the decision reason was used but with some uncertainty since it's not directly stated in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome. The difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. The difference is 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (0 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential gains between the two lotteries (a difference of 1000 Euros between the maximum gain of Lottery B and the certain gain of Lottery A) and the risk of a high loss in Lottery B with the same probability as the gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because, despite the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B, the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B with equal probability to the gain was a deterrent, and the difference in potential gains was not deemed worth the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. The individual considered the difference in potential gains and the risk of loss, which aligns with considering the range of outcomes, although the individual's focus was more on the risk aspect rather than explicitly calculating the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes as the reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was influenced by the desire to avoid the high-risk, high-loss potential of Lottery B, which indirectly aligns with preferring a lottery with more certain and less risky outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's decision-making process, as described, shows an awareness of the risk and potential outcomes that aligns with the decision reason's focus on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the individual calculated or directly considered these differences as the primary reason for their choice. Instead, the risk of loss and the certainty of gain in Lottery A were key factors. Given this, while the individual's reasoning is consistent with the decision reason, it is not a perfect match, leading to a high but not certain assessment that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (6000 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher potential gain in Lottery A but also noted the lower probability of winning and the risk involved. They also considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by highlighting the certainty of the outcome, comparing it favorably to the riskier option of Lottery A, despite the potentially higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which directly relates to the risk or certainty of the outcomes. The individual considered the riskiness of Lottery A versus the certainty of Lottery B, which aligns with the concept of outcome differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (0 Euros difference). The individual chose Lottery B, citing its certainty as a primary reason, which indirectly reflects a preference for a smaller outcome difference (or no difference, in this case).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and their avoidance of the risk in Lottery A aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. While the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these differences, the emphasis on risk and certainty suggests that the concept underlying the decision reason (preference for smaller outcome differences) was influential in their decision-making process. However, since the report does not directly mention comparing outcome differences, the assessment is not a perfect match, hence a score of 80 rather than 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the equal probabilities of winning or losing in Lottery A and the certainty of not winning or losing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a safe option with no risk of loss, even though it means not winning either.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, focuses on the risk aspect and the certainty of not losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual’s justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, but based on the desire for safety and avoiding loss rather than explicitly considering the differences between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes. While the individual chooses Lottery B, the justification provided is based on avoiding risk and ensuring no loss, rather than the specific rule of preferring smaller differences between outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."
