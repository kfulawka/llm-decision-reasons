Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 1% probability. Since we can derive the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery), we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning (Gewinnchancen) and the specific probabilities of outcomes for both lotteries, focusing on the risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros in Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the overall chance of winning something (more or equal to what is offered by A) is high (99%) and the minimal risk (1% chance of 0 Euros) is deemed acceptable compared to choosing Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of the minimum outcome but in the context of its impact on the overall decision, focusing on the high probability of winning something. The decision reason specifically focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not the central consideration in the individual's reasoning as described.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (2400 Euros), which is higher than the 1% probability of the minimum outcome in Lottery B (0 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not align with this rule; instead, it emphasizes the high overall chance of winning and the acceptability of the minimal risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The verbal report shows the individual considered the overall winning chances and the minimal risk, not specifically preferring the lottery based on the probability of its minimum outcome as the decision reason dictates."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 67%, and for Lottery B, it is 66%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 67% for Lottery A and 66% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared all possibilities, noticing that Lotteries A and B are relatively similar. They focused on the probabilities, which they approximated as being about 1/3 for both, with Lottery B being 1% more probable. They also considered the difference in potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the small difference in potential winnings, Lottery B had a slightly higher probability of winning (by 1%), which they considered sufficient reason to choose B over A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was on the winning probabilities (approximated as 1/3 for both) and the slight difference in these probabilities, not directly on the probabilities of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (67% vs. 66%). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its slightly higher winning probability, not the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the probability of the minimum outcome, which would suggest choosing Lottery A due to its higher probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros). In contrast, the individual's decision was based on the slight difference in winning probabilities, leading them to choose Lottery B. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Verbal report:
Zwar wäre der Gewinn bei A höher gewesen mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit von 80% aber bei B gab es 100% einen hohen Gewinn. Dieser lag nur 1000 Euro unter A, aber dafür zu 100%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 20%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the higher potential gain of Lottery A with an 80% probability but also noted the certainty (100% probability) of a high gain from Lottery B, which was only 1000 Euros less than the potential gain from Lottery A. The individual's justification for the choice seems to weigh the trade-off between the potential higher gain of Lottery A and the certainty of a significant gain from Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused more on the maximum outcomes and their probabilities rather than the minimum outcomes directly. However, the mention of the certainty (100% probability) of a ""hohen Gewinn"" (high gain) from Lottery B indirectly touches upon the concept of the minimum guaranteed outcome, which aligns with the decision reason's consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome but does emphasize the 100% probability of a significant gain from Lottery B, which could imply an implicit consideration of the minimum outcome's probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not directly apply the decision reason as stated, there is an indirect consideration of the certainty of outcomes that aligns with the spirit of the decision reason. However, the primary focus of the individual's deliberation, as reported, seems to be on the balance between potential gains and their probabilities rather than explicitly on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. Thus, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there are hints that suggest it might have played a role, albeit not as the primary consideration."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 80%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries (1000 Euros higher for Lottery A) and the difference in probabilities of winning (5% higher for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a 5% higher probability of winning compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, but the individual's consideration was on the difference in winnings and the probabilities of winning, not specifically the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A with an 80% probability of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification was based on the higher probability of winning, which aligns with choosing Lottery B due to its 5% higher chance of winning, not the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the difference in potential winnings and the probabilities of winning, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."
5,"dafür ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 90% attraktiver für mich als nur zu 45% wie in Beispiel B. Daher habe ich die risikoärmere Wahl getroffen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 55%, and for Lottery A, it is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 55% probability
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 10% probability
This information is relevant to the decision reason as it allows us to compare the probabilities of the minimum outcome between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared both options and considered the potential winnings and their respective probabilities. Specifically, they noted that the potential gain from Lottery A is half that of Lottery B but that the probability of winning with Lottery A (90%) is more attractive than the 45% probability of winning with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery A because, despite its lower potential gain compared to Lottery B, its higher probability of winning (90%) made it the less risky choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 55% for Lottery B and 10% for Lottery A. However, the individual's justification primarily discusses the attractiveness of the higher probability of winning (90% for Lottery A), not the probability of the minimum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (55% chance of 0 Euros). In contrast, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A emphasizes its higher probability of winning, not its lower probability of the minimum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the higher probability of winning associated with Lottery A.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, both lotteries have a minimum outcome of 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of winning 0 Euros is 99.9%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the extremely low probabilities of winning in both lotteries (0.1% and 0.2%) and the fact that the amount to be won in Lottery A is higher. They also considered the scenario where they end up with 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, although the probability of winning is lower, the potential gain is higher, and they are willing to take the risk, assuming they will likely end up with 0 Euros anyway.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual's main consideration was the potential gain and the willingness to take a risk, not directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A with 99.9% probability of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the potential for a higher gain and the assumption that they would likely end up with 0 Euros, not because it had a higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not the basis for the individual's choice. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the potential for a higher gain and their willingness to take a risk, given the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"100%igen Verlust gab. Daher habe ich mich entschieden, trotz 1000€ mehr Verlust A zu wählen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with 80% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery, which is 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the difference in losses between the two lotteries (1000 Euros more loss in A) and the possibility of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A with a 20% probability, versus a 100% loss in Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A despite the higher potential loss was the possibility of avoiding any loss with a 20% probability.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability of the minimum outcome) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused more on the potential to avoid loss entirely rather than the probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual does mention the 100% loss in B, which indirectly relates to the decision reason. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case because its minimum outcome has a 100% probability. The individual's justification, however, does not directly align with this rule since they chose Lottery A based on the chance to avoid loss, not because it had a higher probability of its minimum outcome.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is a loss (either -4000 Euros or -3000 Euros). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities:
- Lottery A has a 20% probability of losing 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 25% probability of losing 3000 Euros.
Since the decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, we note that Lottery B has a higher probability (25%) of its minimum outcome compared to Lottery A (20%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual compared the gains and losses of both options, noting that both had high probabilities of loss (20% and 25%). They considered the probabilities of loss and the amounts of potential loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery A because it had a lower probability of loss compared to Lottery B, even though the amount of potential loss was higher. They acknowledged the risk but decided to take it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probabilities of loss. However, the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the lower probability of loss.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification (preferring the lower probability of loss) contradicts the decision reason's rule (preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome). The individual's decision was based on minimizing the risk of loss, not on following the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome (0 Euros) has a probability of 10%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome (0 Euros) has a probability of 55%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for both lotteries and the potential losses. They noted that Lottery A had a lower probability of the minimum outcome (10%) but a smaller loss, while Lottery B had a higher probability of the minimum outcome (55%) but a potentially larger loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the risk and the distribution of outcomes. They preferred the option where the probability of the minimum outcome was at least at half, rather than just 10%, indicating a preference for the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, despite acknowledging the potential for a larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual did consider these probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice, the individual's justification aligns with the decision reason's rule. The individual preferred Lottery B because it had a higher probability of the minimum outcome (55% vs. 10%), even though it meant potentially losing more.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's verbal report indicates that they considered the probabilities of the minimum outcomes and preferred the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, aligning perfectly with the decision reason provided. This suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes (-6000 Euros for A, -3000 Euros for B) and their probabilities (0.1% for A, 0.2% for B), noting that both are very unlikely.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual was deterred by the -6000 Euros in Lottery A and chose Lottery B despite acknowledging that the probability of getting -3000 Euros in B is higher than the probability of getting -6000 Euros in A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual chose Lottery B, which has a higher probability of its minimum outcome (-3000 Euros with 0.2% probability) over Lottery A (-6000 Euros with 0.1% probability), but the justification provided does not explicitly state that this choice was made because of the higher probability of the minimum outcome in B. Instead, the individual seems to have been deterred by the magnitude of the loss in A rather than explicitly preferring B due to its higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing B over A because it has a higher probability of its minimum outcome), but the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was made based on this specific reason. The justification provided focuses more on being deterred by the larger loss in A rather than explicitly preferring B due to the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's not clear that the decision reason was the basis for the choice, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability.
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 50% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of at least 500 Euros (minimum outcome).
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 0 Euros (minimum outcome).
This information is relevant to applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the difference in possible winnings between Lotteries A and B (500 vs. 1000 Euros) and the risk associated with Lottery B (50% risk of not winning).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the difference in possible winnings was not high enough to take a 50% risk, opting for the sure 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the risk (50% probability of not winning in Lottery B) and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a guaranteed (100% probability) outcome, which can be seen as preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome (since 100% is higher than 50% for the minimum outcomes of A and B, respectively).
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual’s decision process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritized the guaranteed outcome over the riskier option, which is consistent with preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification for choosing the guaranteed outcome over the riskier option aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher probability of the minimum outcome. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which is why the assessment is not 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with 50% probability, and there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros, which is a better outcome than the minimum of Lottery A but not the minimum outcome itself. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a 100% chance of its minimum outcome (-500 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 50% chance of its minimum outcome (-1000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk (50/50 probability) of Lottery B and the possibility of not having a loss (0 Euros outcome). They also mention a 2000 bonus, which seems unrelated to the direct comparison of the lotteries but influenced their decision to take the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance to have no loss, despite acknowledging the high risk (50/50 probability). They were willing to take this risk because of the potential to not lose any money and due to the existence of a bonus.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. However, the individual's justification focuses more on the upside of not losing any money (the 0 Euros outcome of Lottery B) rather than the probability of the minimum outcome (-1000 Euros for B and -500 Euros for A).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, Lottery A has a 100% chance of its minimum outcome, which would be preferred by the decision reason. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the chance to avoid any loss, not the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome. Instead, the individual focused on the potential to avoid loss and the presence of a bonus, indicating that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 75%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the number of possibilities to win and the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) in each lottery. They noted that Lottery A offered more possibilities to win than Lottery B, with a lower probability of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating they preferred the ""sicherere Variante"" (safer option), implying they chose based on a perceived lower risk or higher security, which they associated with having more chances to win and a lower probability of ending up with nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) in each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual's justification suggests they preferred the lottery (A) because it offered a perceived safer option due to more possibilities to win and a lower probability of winning nothing, which indirectly aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher probability of non-zero outcomes but does not directly state a preference for the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. Instead, the individual focused on the overall perceived safety and chances of winning, which led them to choose Lottery A. While there is some overlap in considering the probability of the minimum outcome, the primary basis for the individual's decision does not match the decision reason's criteria. Thus, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, also with a 25% probability, but there's an additional outcome of -2000 Euros with 25% probability. However, the minimum outcome across all possibilities in Lottery A is -4000 Euros, which occurs with 25% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 25% for both, considering the worst-case scenario in each.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of loss in both lotteries and the magnitude of the loss. They acknowledged that Lottery B has a lower probability of loss (25%) but a significantly higher loss amount if it occurs.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by accepting a loss but wanting it to be as low as possible, specifically not as high as the potential loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is the same for both lotteries (25%). However, the individual considered not just the probability but also the magnitude of the loss, which is not part of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, but since both lotteries have the same probability for their minimum outcomes, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on minimizing the magnitude of the loss, not solely the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus was on minimizing the magnitude of the loss rather than comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which is what the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A: 5 Euros, 100% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros, 99.9% probability
This information is relevant to the decision reason as it directly pertains to the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual mentions the high potential gain of Lottery B but notes its very low probability (0.1%).
- They highlight the high probability (99.9%) of getting 0 Euros from Lottery B.
- They compare the guaranteed 5 Euros from Lottery A to the potential outcomes of Lottery B, considering 5 Euros as ""rather little"" but preferable to 0 Euros.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed amount (5 Euros) over the high probability of getting nothing (0 Euros) from Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery.
- The individual considers the high probability of getting 0 Euros from Lottery B and the guaranteed 5 Euros from Lottery A, which aligns with focusing on the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome.
- The individual prefers Lottery A because it guarantees a minimum outcome (5 Euros) over the high probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, which implies they are choosing based on the preference for a guaranteed minimum outcome over a highly probable but less desirable minimum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason's focus on the minimum outcomes and their probabilities, and their justification for choosing Lottery A reflects a preference for the higher probability of a minimum outcome (in this case, a guaranteed outcome).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability
- Lottery B: -5 Euros with 100% probability
This information is sufficient for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the small loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B, the extremely low probability (0.1%) of a significant loss in Lottery A, and the high likelihood (99.9%) of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A. The individual was deterred by the extremely high potential loss in Lottery A, despite its low probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because of the certain loss of 5 Euros being more acceptable than the risk of a very large loss in Lottery A, even though the probability of that loss is very low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities but focused more on the magnitude of the potential loss and its probability rather than strictly on the probability of the minimum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. Lottery B has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (-5 Euros), which is higher than the probability of the minimum outcome in Lottery A (-5000 Euros with 0.1% probability). The individual chose Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's preference. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the deterrence by the high potential loss in Lottery A rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome), the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was more on the risk aversion to the large potential loss rather than on comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, and for Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery B's minimum outcome and 100% for Lottery A's minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains and losses of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A offers half the potential gain of Lottery B but with a 100% probability, whereas Lottery B has a 50% chance of gain and a 50% chance of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certain gain of Lottery A over the uncertain outcome of Lottery B, despite the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes but focuses more on the certainty aspect rather than directly comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring a certain gain over a risky option, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since the certain gain (Lottery A) has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome, but the individual does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome), the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made based on comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. The individual's focus on certainty and risk suggests an alignment with the spirit of the decision reason but does not directly follow its specific rule. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability (since it's a certain outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 50% probability of -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% probability of 2000 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential higher gain of Lottery A but also thought about a previous round where they likely lost money. They focused on the certainty of winning with Lottery B, despite the lower gain compared to a potential win with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to take the ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way) due to a previous potential loss, valuing the 100% chance of winning over the potential higher gain of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision. The individual's consideration was more about the certainty of gain and past experiences rather than the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, Lottery B has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (2000 Euros), which aligns with the individual's choice. However, the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly mention the probability of the minimum outcome as the reason for choosing Lottery B. Instead, it emphasizes the desire for a certain gain.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome), the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for the choice. The report focuses more on the desire for certainty and past experiences rather than the specific probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 1000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of -3000 Euros with 50% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all possibilities and focusing on the risk associated with Lottery B, noting it has a 50% chance of either a gain or a loss, which they find too risky despite the potential gain being three times higher than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing that the 50% risk of gain or loss in Lottery B is too high, implying that the certainty of a gain in Lottery A is preferred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual discusses the risk (which can be interpreted as considering the negative outcome) but emphasizes the certainty of the gain in Lottery A over the risk in Lottery B. While the individual does consider the risk (which relates to the minimum outcome in Lottery B), they frame it in terms of overall risk rather than specifically focusing on the probability of the minimum outcome as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implies a preference for certainty over risk, which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a certain (minimum) outcome but does not directly address the comparison of probabilities of minimum outcomes between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's focus on risk and certainty indirectly relates to the concept of the decision reason, which considers the probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual's justification does not directly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes or explicitly state a preference based on these probabilities. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not a clear match, leading to a lower assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 50% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing -6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B and the fact that Lottery A offers no gain or loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it presents no risk of loss or gain, specifically mentioning that the 50% chance of losing -6000 Euros in Lottery B was too risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with the minimum outcome of Lottery B (-6000 Euros) and the certainty of no loss or gain in Lottery A, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual chose Lottery A because it has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is higher than the 50% probability of the minimum outcome in Lottery B (-6000 Euros). The individual’s justification implicitly aligns with the decision reason’s rule by preferring the option with no risk of loss, which corresponds to preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome (in this case, no loss).
