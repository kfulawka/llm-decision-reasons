STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 (100%). 
- Lottery B: The outcomes and their probabilities are 2500 Euros with 33% probability, 2400 Euros with 66% probability, and 0 Euros with 1% probability. The probable outcomes are 2400 Euros.
- Lottery A: The outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability, which is considered probable.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. 
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 2400 Euros, since only the 2400 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold.
- For Lottery A, the average is 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A, the lack of potential loss in Lottery B (noting the 1% chance of winning nothing), and the potential for a €100 higher gain with Lottery B compared to Lottery A. They also mentioned disregarding the actual probability of winning 2500 Euros over 2400 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the small risk (1% chance of winning nothing) against the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B, without fully considering the probabilities of the different outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is 2400 Euros. However, the individual's consideration of the potential higher gain with Lottery B and the dismissal of the probability for the 2500 Euros outcome suggest they did not directly compare the averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (2400 Euros) under the decision reason's criteria, the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, was swayed by the potential for a higher gain and the minimal risk of no gain, not directly applying the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not apply the decision reason as defined, which focuses on the average of probable outcomes and their comparison. The verbal report indicates the individual was influenced by the potential for a higher gain and the perceived minimal risk, rather than directly comparing the averages of the probable outcomes of the two lotteries based on the given probability thresholds."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are two outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, for both lotteries, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, it would be indifferent between the two lotteries because both have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible gains/losses and the percentages. They noted the difference in gains (100€) and the difference in percentages (1%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by considering the potential additional value of 100€ to be better than the 1% difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would only consider the 0 Euros outcomes for both lotteries since they are the only probable outcomes. The individual, however, considered the differences in potential gains and percentages, not specifically focusing on the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries because both have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros). The individual, however, chose Lottery A based on the potential additional value of 100€ over the 1% difference in probabilities, not because of a preference based on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The decision reason would lead to indifference, but the individual made a choice based on different criteria (the value of additional potential gain versus the percentage difference). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is greater than 50%. 
- For Lottery A, there is one outcome (3000 Euros) with 100% probability, which is probable.
- For Lottery B, there are two outcomes: 4000 Euros with 80% probability (probable) and 0 Euros with 20% probability (not probable).
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason includes:
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 3000 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery A versus the 80% chance of winning in Lottery B, and the potential regret of losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery A because they would regret missing out on the sure win if they chose Lottery B and ended up with nothing, even though Lottery B offers a higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 3000 Euros and for Lottery B is 4000 Euros. However, the individual's consideration was more about the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the potential regret of not winning in Lottery B, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the desire for a certain win and the avoidance of potential regret, not explicitly because of the average probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's choice was driven by the desire for certainty and the avoidance of regret, rather than the comparison of average probable outcomes between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, for Lottery B, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable, and for Lottery A, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since 0 Euros is the only probable outcome), and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason is indifferent between the two lotteries based on the given probabilities and outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual visualized the probabilities as fractions (1/5 for 20% and 1/4 for 25%) and thought about the difference in probabilities and the difference in the monetary outcomes (1000 Euros) between the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the 5% difference in probabilities seemed significant, but the 1000 Euros difference in outcomes did not seem large enough to justify the lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of outcomes with probabilities higher than 50%. However, the individual's consideration was more about the comparison of probabilities and the difference in outcomes rather than focusing on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different consideration (the perceived significance of the probability difference versus the outcome difference).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on a different analysis of probabilities and outcomes, not on comparing the averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason prescribes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 3000 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros (since only the 3000 Euro outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both lotteries and compared them, noting that the probability of winning in Lottery B is higher than winning double the amount in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a higher probability of winning, which aligns with preferring the safer option to avoid regret over not taking the more secure chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 3000 Euros. The individual considered the higher probability of winning in Lottery B but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since the higher probability contributes to a higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's reasoning about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason, which prefers Lottery B due to its higher average of probable outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not a perfect match, leading to an assessment that is above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros with 0.1% (0.001) probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% (0.999) probability. The 0 Euro outcome is the only probable outcome because its probability (0.999) is higher than 0.5.
For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 0.2% (0.002) probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% (0.998) probability. The 0 Euro outcome is the only probable outcome because its probability (0.998) is higher than 0.5.
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros since only the 0 Euro outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable in both cases.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains/losses and the percentages of the lotteries. They noted that the possible gain was twice as high in Lottery A as in Lottery B, but the percentage chance of winning was twice as high in Lottery B as in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential gain in Lottery A, the percentage chance of winning was higher in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the outcomes with probabilities higher than 0.5. However, the individual's consideration was on the potential gains and the percentages, without explicitly calculating or considering the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification was based on the comparison of potential gains and winning percentages, not on the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual considered different aspects (potential gains and winning percentages) and did not apply the specific rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so its single outcome is always considered probable. 
- Lottery A has one probable outcome: -4000 Euros with 80% probability.
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: -3000 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is -4000 Euros (since only one outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it's -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery B because -3000 is greater than -4000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B versus the high probability of losing 4000 Euros in Lottery A but also notes the 20% chance of losing nothing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a chance, albeit small, of not losing any money, which is seen as better than a certain but smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are -4000 for Lottery A and -3000 for Lottery B. The individual, however, focuses on the possibility of not losing anything in Lottery A and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its higher average probable outcome (-3000 vs. -4000), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the desire to have any chance of avoiding loss, not directly comparing the average probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the average of probable outcomes, leading to a preference for Lottery B, whereas the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the presence of a small chance of no loss, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is greater than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (75%) is higher than 50%.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their calculation of the average of these outcomes for each lottery. Since both lotteries have only one probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual recognized that both lotteries involve losses and noted the 5% difference in the probability of no loss (or 0 Euros outcome) between Lottery A and Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the ""potentiell höheren Verlust"" (potentially higher loss), which seems counterintuitive given the usual preference for lower losses. However, the individual's focus was on the difference in probabilities of avoiding a loss, not directly on the magnitude of the losses or the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the 0 Euros outcome for both lotteries, resulting in an average of 0 for both. The individual, however, focused on the difference in probabilities of not losing and the potential for a higher loss, not on calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the decision reason would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, does not align with this rule, as they chose based on a different criterion (the potential for a higher loss and the difference in probabilities of no loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would lead to indifference between the two lotteries, whereas the individual's choice was based on different criteria (the potential for higher loss and the difference in probabilities of avoiding a loss). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 0.5. For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 0.5. Therefore, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros for Lottery B and -3000 Euros for Lottery A. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros (since only the -3000 Euro outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher probability of not losing anything, but this seems to be a misunderstanding since Lottery A actually offers a higher probability (90%) of not losing anything (i.e., getting -3000 Euros is considered losing, and 0 Euros is considered not losing, but the individual's statement about preferring the higher probability of not losing anything is misapplied given the lotteries' descriptions). The statement seems to reflect a focus on avoiding loss but is inaccurately applied to the provided options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on the calculation, would prefer Lottery B (average of 0 Euros) over Lottery A (average of -3000 Euros) if considering only the probable outcomes as defined. However, the individual's consideration, as stated, is about the probability of not losing anything, which aligns with considering outcomes but is misinterpreted in the context of the lotteries provided.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would suggest preferring Lottery B based on the calculation of probable outcomes. However, the individual's justification, as stated, does not accurately reflect the application of this rule given the misinterpretation of ""not losing anything"" in the context of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The final assessment is 0 because, despite the individual's mention of considering probabilities and the desire to avoid loss, the application of this consideration does not align with the decision reason's rule regarding the average of probable outcomes. The individual's stated reasoning about preferring the higher probability of not losing anything is misapplied to the given lotteries, indicating a misunderstanding of the decision problem's structure rather than an application of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is greater than 0.5. Therefore, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is greater than 0.5. Therefore, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
Since both lotteries have only one probable outcome (0 Euros), and this outcome is the same for both, we need to calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. 
- The average probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
- The average probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
Given that both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on the probable outcomes alone.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential to lose money or for nothing to happen in both lotteries, noting that for a doubled loss (in Lottery B), there was half the probability compared to Lottery A. They also noted that 0.1% (probability of losing in Lottery B) is significantly less than 0.2% (probability of losing in Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the potential loss being doubled, the probability of this loss (0.1%) was perceived as significantly less than the 0.2% probability of losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, are the same for both lotteries (0 Euros). The individual, however, focused on the comparison of loss probabilities and the fact that one lottery offers a potential loss that is twice as large but half as likely as the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome. However, the individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the relative probabilities of loss and the magnitude of potential loss, not on comparing the average probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to both having the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), but the individual chose based on a different criterion (comparing probabilities and magnitudes of potential losses). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is probable since 100% is higher than 1/1 or 100%. The relevant information for Lottery A is the 1000 Euros with 50% probability and the 0 Euros with 50% probability. For Lottery B, it's the 500 Euros with 100% probability. Since both outcomes in Lottery A have a 50% probability, they are both considered probable. For Lottery B, the single outcome is also probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the trade-off between a certain gain and the potential for no gain (0 Euros) with Lottery A, noting the 50% probability of winning nothing and comparing the potential winnings of Lottery A to the certain gain of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the certain gain (Lottery B) over the potential higher but uncertain gain of Lottery A, citing the security of the gain as the reason, even though it was lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the certainty of gain in Lottery B versus the uncertainty of Lottery A, which aligns with considering probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. However, the individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes. The individual chose Lottery B, which has an average probable outcome of 500 Euros, the same as Lottery A's average probable outcome. The decision reason would be indifferent in this case since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes, but the individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of the gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's consideration of the certainty of gain and the potential for no gain aligns with aspects of the decision reason, but the explicit calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes are not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for choosing the certain gain over the potential higher but uncertain gain does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially since the averages are equal. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there's only one outcome, so it's always considered probable. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable because their probabilities are exactly 50%, which meets the criteria since it's not less than 1/2.
- Lottery A has one outcome: -500 Euros with 100% probability, which is considered probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering their current balance (""mein Guthaben"") and the specific chance of not losing anything with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers the 50% chance of not losing anything (Lottery B) over the certainty of losing (Lottery A), indicating a desire to avoid a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, is the same for both lotteries (-500 Euros). However, the individual's consideration seems to focus more on the aspect of avoiding a certain loss rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since their average probable outcomes are equal. The individual, however, expresses a preference for Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing, which aligns with a risk-averse perspective but doesn't directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice might superficially align with what the decision reason could suggest in terms of preferring an option that offers a chance to avoid loss, the verbal report does not demonstrate a clear application of the decision reason's specific rule regarding the average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion and avoiding certain losses rather than explicitly comparing the average outcomes of the lotteries based on their probabilities."
13,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. The probable outcomes for Lottery B are 0 Euros with 75% probability. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. The probable outcomes for Lottery A are 0 Euros with 50% probability. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and potential winnings of both lotteries, visualizing them as balls (Kugeln) to understand the chances better. They noted that Lottery B has a higher potential gain but also a higher risk of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B by weighing the risk of winning nothing (75% for Lottery B vs. 50% for Lottery A) against the potential winnings (6000 Euros for Lottery B vs. 4000 or 2000 Euros for Lottery A), deciding that the potential high reward of Lottery B was worth the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold (1/2 for Lottery B and 1/3 for Lottery A). The individual, however, considered the overall risk and potential gain, not specifically calculating or mentioning the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have an average of probable outcomes as 0 Euros based on the decision reason's criteria, the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on a different consideration, focusing on the balance between risk and potential reward rather than the specific rule of averaging probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus was on the risk-reward tradeoff rather than the specific probabilities and averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros (50% probability) since it's the only outcome meeting the criteria.
For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros (75% probability) because it exceeds the 50% threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially looked at the percentages because Lottery A had 3 possible outcomes. They then realized both lotteries only offered losses, which made the numbers (probabilities) less interesting to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they had a higher probability of making no losses, which led them to choose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities, whereas the individual considered the probability of not making a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual chose based on the higher probability of no loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher probability of the 0 Euro outcome but does not directly apply the decision reason’s rule about averaging probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus was on avoiding losses with higher probability, which, while related to the concept of outcomes and their probabilities, does not demonstrate the application of the specific decision reason provided. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility of indirect influence due to the consideration of probabilities and outcomes."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is one outcome (5 Euros with 100% probability), so the threshold for a probable outcome is 1/1 = 1 (or 100%). Since 100% is higher than the threshold, the 5 Euros outcome is considered probable. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes (5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability), so the threshold for a probable outcome is 1/2 = 0.5 (or 50%). Only the 0 Euros outcome meets this criterion because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcomes are 5 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 5 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain outcome of Lottery A (5 Euros with 100% probability) and the low-probability high-reward outcome of Lottery B (5000 Euros with 0.1% probability). They also considered the implications of winning or not winning each amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the practical impact of the amounts and the probabilities, mentioning that 5 Euros is not a significant amount but that winning 5000 Euros would be a significant success. However, they also note that not winning the 5000 Euros is not considered a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are 5 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The individual considered the certain outcome of Lottery A and the potential significant gain from Lottery B but did not explicitly discuss averages of probable outcomes based on the defined probability threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems more focused on the subjective value of the outcomes and their probabilities rather than a straightforward calculation of averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate that they used the specific decision reason of comparing the averages of probable outcomes based on the given probability threshold. While they considered the outcomes and their implications, their justification does not align closely with the decision reason's rule, suggesting that this specific reason was not the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the probability threshold for an outcome to be considered probable is 1/1 = 1, which is inherently met since the only outcome has a 100% probability. 
For Lottery A, the -5000 Euros outcome has a 0.1% probability, which is less than 0.5, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 99.9% probability, which is greater than 0.5. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the -5 Euros outcome has a 100% probability, making it a probable outcome.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference in the amount of potential loss between the two lotteries, noting that the certain loss of 5 Euros is significantly less than the potential loss of 5000 Euros, despite the low probability of the latter.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the certain loss of 5 Euros is perceived as minimal compared to the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even though the chance of losing 5000 Euros is very low. The individual also mentions the potential for regret if they were to choose Lottery A and then lose 5000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is -5 Euros. The individual considers the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities but does not explicitly discuss averaging probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, Lottery A has a higher average (0 Euros) than Lottery B (-5 Euros), which would suggest preferring Lottery A based on the decision reason. However, the individual chooses Lottery B, citing the significant difference in potential loss amounts and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its higher average of probable outcomes (0 Euros vs. -5 Euros), but the individual chooses Lottery B based on a different rationale (focusing on the perceived minimal loss and potential regret). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, which exactly meets this threshold, but since the instruction is ""higher than,"" neither outcome strictly meets the criteria for being probable under this reason. However, for the sake of analysis, we'll consider how the reason might apply given the context: Lottery B has two outcomes, both with 50% probability, which are -3000 Euros and 3000 Euros. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so any outcome with a probability greater than 1/1 = 1 is considered probable, which is the 1500 Euros with 100% probability. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is straightforward: 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, since neither outcome exceeds the probability threshold, the calculation based strictly on the reason's criteria would not consider either outcome, but this seems to be a border case that might be interpreted in the context of the decision. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the certain gain of 1500 Euros in Lottery A and potentially the consideration of both outcomes in Lottery B due to their equal probability, though technically, neither is ""probable"" by the reason's strict definition.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions choosing the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) over the ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on preferring a certain gain over the potential for loss, which suggests a risk-averse approach.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the certain gain and the potential loss, which aligns with considering the outcomes of the lotteries but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is about avoiding potential loss and preferring a certain gain, which does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's reasoning seems more aligned with risk aversion than with the specific calculation of averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report suggests a focus on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain over potential loss, which does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the average of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so the single outcome is considered probable by default. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery B: Both outcomes are probable (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros).
- Lottery A: The single outcome is probable (2000 Euros).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) and compares it to a ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of one lottery and the risk of loss in the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides in favor of the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) over the ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), suggesting their decision is based on the preference for a guaranteed positive outcome over a risky option that includes a potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves considering all probable outcomes of each lottery. The individual seems to focus on the aspect of a ""safe gain"" versus a potential loss, which aligns with considering the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risky nature of Lottery B but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery A (2000 Euros) over Lottery B (0 Euros average). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring a safe gain over a potential loss, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's outcome since Lottery A offers a guaranteed positive outcome, but the individual does not explicitly discuss averaging outcomes or comparing averages between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the ""sicheren Gewinn"" and avoidance of ""potentiellen Verlust"" aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A over B), but the specific process of calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome of the decision, the process described does not clearly match the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, which has a probability of 1, making it probable. The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery B, the average of the probable outcomes is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is 1000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery A and the 50-50 chance of either gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros from Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certainty of a gain over the potential for a higher gain or a loss, even if the potential gain is three times as high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery B is 0 and for Lottery A is 1000. The individual considers the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss or higher gain, which aligns with evaluating outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual prefers Lottery A due to the certainty of gain, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since the certain gain (1000 Euros) is indeed a higher average outcome compared to the average of probable outcomes of Lottery B (0). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's reasoning about preferring certainty over potential risk aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes as the basis for the decision. The focus on certainty and risk suggests an understanding that aligns with the decision reason's preference for a higher average of probable outcomes, but it does not directly demonstrate the use of this specific decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not clear that the decision reason was directly used, leading to an assessment below the midpoint."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery B, there is only one outcome with a probability of 1, which is also considered probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery A, both 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros are probable; for Lottery B, 0 Euros is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual first looks at the lottery with a certain outcome (Lottery B), noting that it offers no change. Then, they consider Lottery A, recognizing its 50-50 probability and the equal magnitude of potential gain or loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because they would rather have no change than take a 50% risk of losing 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is 0 Euros. The individual considers the certainty of no change in Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A but does not explicitly calculate or compare averages of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would result in a tie since both lotteries have an average of 0 Euros. The individual's justification is based on a preference for avoiding risk rather than directly comparing averages of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes to make a choice. The individual's focus is on avoiding risk and preferring no change over a potential loss, rather than calculating and comparing averages of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
