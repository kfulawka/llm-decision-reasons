To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. 

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for Lottery A is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for Lottery B is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros.

Since we can derive the relevant information (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes for both lotteries), we can proceed to apply the decision reason.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and the minimum outcomes. Comparing the differences calculated:
- Lottery A has a difference of 2500 Euros.
- Lottery B has a difference of 2400 Euros.

Since 2400 Euros (the difference for Lottery B) is less than 2500 Euros (the difference for Lottery A), according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred over Lottery A.
