STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, (2500-1825), (2400-1825), and (0-1825); for Lottery B, (2400-1825). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can derive the relevant information for this reason from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report states, ""Ansehen aller Informationenda B einen garantierten Gewinn hat, Entscheidung für B,"" which translates to ""Considering all information, B has a guaranteed gain, decision for B."" From this, we can summarize the information considered by the individual as the guaranteed gain of Lottery B. The individual's justification for the choice is that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed gain of Lottery B), we see they do not directly align. The individual focused on the guarantee of gain rather than calculating and comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level. Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual's justification (preferring the guaranteed gain), it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision seems based more on the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculated aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision problem involves choosing between two lotteries, A and B, with different monetary outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. This means the aspiration level is 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference and a 66% chance of a negative difference, while Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference and a 67% chance of a negative difference. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing the probabilities of getting zero (noting that Lottery B has a one percentage point lower probability of getting zero) and the potential gain (noting that the possible gain in Lottery B is 100 Euros higher). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the comparison of the probabilities of getting zero and the difference in potential gains between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the direct comparison of probabilities of getting zero and the difference in potential gains, without explicit mention of an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual’s justification. The individual seems to make a choice based on a direct comparison of the potential gains and the probability of not winning, rather than the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of positive differences from such a level in their decision-making process. The focus is on direct comparisons of outcomes and probabilities, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery A, the differences are (4000 - 2333.33) = 1666.67 Euros and (0 - 2333.33) = -2333.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is (3000 - 2333.33) = 666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the guaranteed win at Lottery B and the possible win at Lottery A, noting that despite the higher possible win at A, they chose B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on the guarantee of Lottery B being more appealing despite its lower value compared to the possible win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not directly match the individual's focus on the guarantee versus the possible win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which does not align with the individual's justification that emphasizes the guarantee of Lottery B over the potential higher reward of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level calculated from the mean of all outcomes. The individual's focus on the guarantee of Lottery B versus the potential higher reward of Lottery A does not indicate the use of the aspiration level concept or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Lottery A has a 20% probability of a positive difference (2250), and Lottery B has a 25% probability of a positive difference (1250). Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""Ansehen aller InfosZufallsauswahl, da beide Lotterien ziemlich ähnlich"", which translates to ""Looking at all the information, a random selection, since both lotteries are quite similar"". The individual considered all the information but found the lotteries to be similar, leading to a random selection. The justification for the choice seems to be the perceived similarity between the two lotteries rather than a detailed analysis of outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and probabilities of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (all information but concluding similarity), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the specific factors of the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice (similarity and randomness) does not align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences). The decision reason involves a specific calculation and comparison that is not mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we first need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. The outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros (from Lottery A), 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros (from Lottery B). The aspiration level = (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 6000 Euros, the difference is 6000 - 2250 = 3750; for 0 Euros (from Lottery A), the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250; for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 2250 = 750; and for 0 Euros (from Lottery B), the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250. Now, we consider the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) is 45%. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (3000 Euros) is 90%. According to the decision reason, the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences is preferred, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the size of the gain (Gewinn) and the probability (Wahrscheinlichkeit) of winning in both lotteries, noting that the gain in Lottery B is half as large as in Lottery A but the probability is twice as high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite the gain being half as large, the probability of winning is twice as high, and since the game is played only once, these factors favor Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the size of the gains and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual’s preference for Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning. However, the individual's reasoning does not explicitly match the decision reason's process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision to choose Lottery B aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a positive outcome), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly used the aspiration level calculation or focused on the probability of positive differences as described in the decision reason. Thus, while there is some alignment in the final choice, the reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."
6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. This aspiration level is relevant for comparing the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. The reason then prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. This can be applied to the given decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries (""gering ist (1 von 1000 vs 2 von 1000)"") and the potential for a higher gain (""möglichen doppelt so hohen Gewinn"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the potential for a higher gain despite the low probabilities, indicating a focus on the magnitude of the potential win relative to the comparison between the two options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on the comparison of potential gains and the low probabilities, not explicitly on an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the lottery with the potential for a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn"" (twice as high a gain), which suggests a consideration of the magnitude of outcomes but does not directly address the concept of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. However, the individual's focus on the higher potential gain could indirectly relate to the concept of seeking a positive difference, but it lacks the explicit consideration of an aspiration level and its associated probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the potential for higher gains, which could be tangentially related to the concept of positive differences, the explicit process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences from that level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a slight possibility of indirect relevance."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0 - (-1000)) is 20% (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros), and in Lottery B, there's no positive difference since -3000 - (-1000) = -2000 is negative. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived, focusing on the probability of achieving outcomes better than the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and notes that with Lottery A, there's at least a chance (1 out of 5, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the given probabilities, as the actual chance of not losing anything with Lottery A is 20%, or 1 out of 5, which might be correctly interpreted in the context of the verbal report) of not losing anything.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because there's a chance of not losing anything, implying the consideration of avoiding loss or the presence of a potential positive outcome (not losing) influenced the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes being better than this level. The individual considered the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A, which aligns with considering positive outcomes (in this case, avoiding loss) but doesn't explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of better outcomes across both lotteries based on such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the chance of not losing, which can be seen as a form of positive outcome but doesn't directly reference the comparison of probabilities of being above an aspiration level across both options.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's focus on avoiding loss and the presence of a chance for a ""positive"" outcome (not losing) shares some conceptual similarity with the decision reason's focus on positive differences from an aspiration level, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of better outcomes based on such a level. Therefore, the assessment leans towards uncertainty, as the individual's decision process seems to intuitively align with aspects of the decision reason but lacks explicit mention of key components.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros (from Lottery A), and -3000 Euros, 0 Euros (from Lottery B).
- The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -4000 / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between each outcome and this aspiration level. 
For Lottery A, the differences are: -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750.
For Lottery B, the differences are: -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the loss (Verlust) associated with each lottery and its probability, noting that the loss in Lottery B is smaller but also somewhat more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, even though it is somewhat more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the size of the loss and its probability, not on an aspiration level or differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the smaller loss in Lottery B, regardless of the aspiration level concept.
Based on these comparisons, the decision reason's specific process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences from it does not match the individual's focus on the size and probability of losses.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, it's -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, it's -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the positive difference (2250) occurs with 10% probability (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the positive difference (2250) occurs with 55% probability (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros). Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability of a positive difference from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss of Lottery B being double that of Lottery A but noted that the possibility of getting 0 Euros (no loss) is higher with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher possible loss, the higher probability of no loss (getting 0 Euros) was more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the higher probability of no loss (0 Euros) in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of a positive outcome relative to an implied reference point (though not explicitly calculating an aspiration level).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher probability of the 0 Euro outcome being a positive difference. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, based on the higher probability of not incurring a loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the higher probability of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery B aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, even though the aspiration level itself is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification and the decision reason's rule, though the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention an aspiration level. The individual's focus on the probability of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros) as a positive outcome indirectly supports the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an implied reference point."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 2250 with a probability of 99.9% and 99.8%, respectively, but the negative differences are different. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report states that ""the loss at B is only half as high as at A, even with double the risk (2 in 1000 instead of 1 in 1000), therefore B"". The information considered by the individual is the magnitude of the potential loss and the risk (probability) of the loss. The individual's justification for the choice is that the lower loss at B, despite the higher risk, makes B preferable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of potential loss, risk of loss). The individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, but focuses on the loss and risk. Second, compare the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual's justification (preferring B due to the lower loss despite higher risk). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the loss and risk rather than the probability of positive differences. However, the individual's consideration of the loss and risk might indirectly relate to the decision reason, as the lower loss at B could be seen as a factor in the aspiration level calculation. Given these comparisons, it seems uncertain whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative); for Lottery A, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros (no difference). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference (but a 100% probability of no difference, which could be considered as not negative), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""Ansehen aller InfosEntscheidung für A bei garantiertem Gewinn,"" which translates to ""Considering all the information, decision for A with a guaranteed win."" The individual considered all the information and chose Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (all the information, focusing on the guaranteed win of Lottery A). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (guaranteed win). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes certainty rather than the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level. Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference, the relevant information for the decision reason is the presence of a positive difference in Lottery A and its probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report translates to ""Looking at all the information, with A, there is at least a chance of not losing anything."" This indicates the individual considered the possibility of not losing with Lottery A, which aligns with the outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery A. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the aspect of avoiding loss or having a chance of no loss, which is implicit in the consideration of Lottery A's outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the presence of a positive difference and its probability in Lottery A) with that considered by the individual (the chance of not losing with Lottery A), we see a partial alignment. The individual focuses on the aspect of not losing, which is related to the positive difference (0 Euros being better than -500 Euros aspiration level) but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice (focusing on the chance of not losing) does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences), but it touches upon the concept of valuing the positive outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery A, which is part of the decision reason's consideration.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while there are elements in the verbal report that align with the considerations of the decision reason (such as valuing the chance of not losing, which relates to the positive difference), the report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as required by the decision reason. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but the report suggests that the individual's thought process was not fully aligned with the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the winning probability is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of the aspiration level and the consideration of differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the winning probability, which does not directly relate to the aspiration level or the specific calculation of positive differences as described in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level, while the individual chose based on the general notion of a higher winning probability without mentioning the aspiration level or the specific differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on a higher winning probability, which does not align with the specific rule of the decision reason that considers the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual calculated or considered an aspiration level or the specific differences between outcomes and this level, which are crucial components of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as follows:
AL = (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -12000 / 5 = -2400 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery B are: -6000 - (-2400) = -3600 and 0 - (-2400) = 2400.
For Lottery A, the differences are: -4000 - (-2400) = -1600, -2000 - (-2400) = 400, and 0 - (-2400) = 2400.
The decision reason considers the probability of positive differences. For Lottery B, the positive difference (2400) occurs with 75% probability, and for Lottery A, positive differences (400 and 2400) occur with 25% + 50% = 75% probability.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and its probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller, even though the loss is more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the size and probability of losses, which seems related but not directly focused on the aspiration level or positive differences as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the smaller possible loss, even if more probable.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on the magnitude and probability of losses rather than the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences from this aspiration level for each outcome are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 = -1666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 = 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 = -1671.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a guaranteed outcome (no probability of a positive difference in the context of the aspiration level, as the outcome is below the aspiration level), and Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference (and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference), we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the low probability of winning a higher amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because its win is guaranteed, whereas Lottery B only offers a chance (1 in 1000) to win a higher amount. The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the uncertainty and low probability of the higher outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the guarantee of the win in Lottery A and the low probability of the higher win in Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the guaranteed outcome, which implies a focus on certainty rather than the probability of exceeding an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's focus is more on the guarantee versus the risk, without mentioning or implying the calculation of an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 = -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67; for Lottery A, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss of Lottery B, its low probability, and the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high loss is very unlikely compared to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of the aspiration level and the consideration of differences between outcomes and this level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the likelihood of the high loss and the comparison of losses, not explicitly on the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the calculations or the rule specified by the decision reason. The focus on the probability of the high loss and the comparison of losses between the two lotteries does not explicitly reflect the consideration of an aspiration level or the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, calculate the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level = (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery B are (3000 - 500) = 2500 and (-3000 - 500) = -3500. For Lottery A, the difference is (1500 - 500) = 1000. The decision reason considers the probability of positive differences, which for Lottery B is 50% (since only one outcome is positive relative to the aspiration level) and for Lottery A is 100% (since the single outcome is positive relative to the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's report mentions that they looked at all the information and decided on Lottery A because the gain is guaranteed. This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A as a key factor in their decision. The justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the guaranteed win, which suggests the individual valued the certainty of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed gain in Lottery A), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both involve considering the outcomes of the lotteries. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of a win in Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's preference for higher probabilities of positive outcomes but does not directly mention the aspiration level or the specific calculation of probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while there is a slight connection between the decision reason and the individual's thought process (both consider the desirability of positive outcomes), the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason (aspiration level, probabilities of positive differences) are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos Entscheidung für A bei garantiertem Gewinn"", which translates to ""Considering all information, decision for A with guaranteed win"". The individual considered all the information and chose Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the guaranteed nature of the outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (all information, guaranteed win), it appears that the individual did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. The individual's justification for the choice (guaranteed win) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences). However, the guaranteed win of Lottery A implies a 100% probability of a positive difference (1333.33) from the aspiration level, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for higher probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason, but the choice of Lottery A due to its guaranteed win could be seen as indirectly aligned with the decision reason's preference. However, the lack of explicit mention of the aspiration level or the decision reason's specific criteria in the verbal report suggests that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the decision. Thus, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason not being used but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 1000 Euros

The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 333.33 ≈ 2666.67 and -3000 - 333.33 ≈ -3333.33
- For Lottery B: 1000 - 333.33 ≈ 666.67

The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and a 50% chance of a negative difference, and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (given the calculated aspiration level), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it guarantees a positive difference from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain, while Lottery A has a possible loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a gain, implying a preference for avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on the guaranteed gain of one lottery and the possible loss of the other, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which aligns with choosing Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to choosing Lottery B but is based on the presence of a guaranteed gain and the avoidance of possible loss, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's justification seems more aligned with a risk-averse attitude or a preference for guaranteed outcomes rather than the specific calculation and comparison involved in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice matches the outcome of applying the decision reason, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason's specific process (involving aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences) was used. The individual's reasoning appears to be more intuitive or based on a different criterion (guaranteed gain vs. possible loss)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference (because its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of a win with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because a win is possible, implying that the potential for a positive outcome was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual does mention the possibility of a win, which aligns with considering positive outcomes, there's no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the possibility of winning, which indirectly relates to positive differences but does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the comparative probabilities of positive outcomes between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the possibility of a win with Lottery A aligns partially with the concept of seeking positive outcomes, a key aspect of the decision reason. However, the verbal report lacks explicit consideration of the aspiration level and comparative probabilities of positive differences, which are central to the decision reason. Thus, while there's a slight alignment, it's not sufficient to conclude that the individual used the decision reason as defined."
