Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows:
- EV(A) = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01)
- EV(A) = 825 + 1584
- EV(A) = 2409 Euros

For Lottery B, the expected value is straightforward since there's only one outcome:
- EV(B) = 2400 * 1 = 2400 Euros

The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can indeed be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it indicates that Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions looking at all options and focusing on the winning options of Lottery A, indicating consideration of the potential gains and possibly their probabilities.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a possibility of winning more than Lottery B, with a very low probability of winning nothing. This suggests the individual considered the potential for higher gains and the low risk of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and low risk of losing), it seems the individual considered aspects that could relate to expected value but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (possibility of winning more with a low risk of nothing), there's an alignment in the sense that both involve preferring an option based on its potential for greater reward, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention expected value or a systematic comparison of the two lotteries based on this criterion.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align with the spirit of preferring higher potential rewards but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment indicates that while there are elements of the individual's decision process that align with considering the potential for higher rewards (a key aspect of expected value), the explicit calculation and comparison of expected values as the basis for the decision are not clearly described in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used in its precise form, but there is some conceptual overlap in the decision-making process."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the similarity between the options and the difficulty of calculating the expected value mentally. They also considered the similarity in the potential winnings and the probability of winning something in each lottery. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the probability of winning something, rather than directly calculating or comparing the expected values.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (similarity of options, difficulty of mental calculation, similarity in winnings, and probability of winning), there is a mismatch. The individual did not explicitly consider or calculate the expected values. Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of winning something because the winnings are similarly high), the rule and justification do not align. The individual's decision was based on the perceived likelihood of winning rather than the calculated expected value of each lottery.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value.

Verbal report:
Ich habe mich für B entschieden, weil dort der mathematische Erwartungswert des Gewinns höher ist. Zudem sind 80% immer noch eine relativ hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""mathematische Erwartungswert des Gewinns"" (mathematical expected value of the win) and the ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) of 80% for Lottery B, indicating they considered the expected value and the probability of winning for Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher ""mathematische Erwartungswert des Gewinns"" and an 80% winning probability is considered ""relativ hoch"" (relatively high).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (expected value and winning probability of Lottery B), it's clear the individual considered the key factor of expected value.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (choosing Lottery B because of its higher expected value), the individual's justification aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report directly mentions considering the expected value of the lotteries and choosing the one with the higher expected value, which perfectly aligns with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions recognizing a parallel to another task and considering the options multiple times, indicating a thoughtful approach. However, the key information considered is the ""erwartbare Gewinn"" (expected gain or win), which directly relates to the expected value of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because ""dort der erwartbare Gewinn höher ist"" (the expected gain is higher there), which indicates that the decision was based on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (expected gain), we see a direct match. The individual considered the expected gain, which is essentially the expected value of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose Lottery A because it has a higher expected gain), we find that the individual's decision aligns with the rule of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. Both lotteries have the same expected value of 2700 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (referred to as ""Gewinnerwartung"") of both lotteries and believed them to be equal. They also considered the probability of winning something in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher probability of winning something (i.e., not ending up with 0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values and found them to be equal, which aligns with the actual calculation. However, the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since their expected values are equal.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing either lottery or being indifferent since they have the same expected value, but it does not consider the probability of winning as a tie-breaker. The individual, however, used the probability of winning something as the justification for choosing Lottery B, not the expected value as the sole criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value as the sole criterion for their choice, since they based their decision on the probability of winning something, not on the expected value, which they believed to be equal for both lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6. For Lottery B, EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as both lotteries having an expected value of 6 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, recognizing they are equal, and also considered the probability of winning any amount in each lottery.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a higher probability of winning any amount, despite the lower amount won, given that the probabilities of winning are very low in both cases.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the expected value, which is the key piece of information for the decision reason. However, the individual also considered the probability of winning any amount, which is not directly part of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. The individual, however, chose based on the probability of winning, not strictly adhering to the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual considered the expected value, a key component of the decision reason, but ultimately made the decision based on the probability of winning any amount, not the expected value. Since the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the higher expected value and the individual chose based on a different criterion (probability of winning), it indicates the decision reason was not used as the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we proceed as follows:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is -3000 Euros (since it has a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the expected value can be calculated as (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the possible outcomes of the lotteries and then specifically mentioned calculating or estimating the expected gain (though referred to as ""erwartbaren Gewinn,"" which translates to ""expected gain,"" it's clear from the context they meant the expected value, considering the losses) of Lottery B, finding it to be lower than that of Lottery A. 
Second, the individual justified their choice of Lottery A over Lottery B based on the ""mathematischen Gewinnerwartung"" (mathematical expectation of gain), which translates to considering the mathematical expectation or expected value, and also mentioned weighing the risk of losing more with Lottery B against the chance of losing nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual did consider the expected outcomes, specifically mentioning the comparison of expected values between the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification for the choice, the individual chose Lottery A because its expected loss was less severe, implying they preferred the option with the ""higher"" expected value in the context of minimizing loss.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did consider and apply the decision reason that focuses on the expected value of each lottery to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, meaning it prefers the lottery with the lesser negative expected value in this context. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of -800 Euros for Lottery A and -750 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the options, looked at the loss amounts and probabilities, and thought about the expected outcomes (""Gewinnerwartungen überschlagen"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the expected loss (""erwartbare Verlust"") is smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, which aligns with the individual considering the expected outcomes and choosing based on the smaller expected loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value (or lesser negative value in this case), which matches the individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B because it has a smaller expected loss.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as both involve comparing the expected outcomes of the lotteries and choosing the one that is less negative.

Since the expected values can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is the probability of losing something in each lottery. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is that Lottery A has a lower probability of losing something. The individual focuses on the probability of loss rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probability of loss), it appears they are not directly aligned. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preference for the lower probability of loss), they seem to be based on different criteria. The decision reason is about maximizing expected value, while the individual's justification is about minimizing the risk of loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries have the same expected value of -6 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the parallel to a previous decision, noticed that the expected value is the same for both lotteries, and acknowledged that it's very unlikely to lose anything in both cases.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, in the unlikely event of losing, the amount to lose is less with Lottery B. They found this decision very difficult.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the expected value, noting it was the same for both lotteries, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the magnitude of the potential loss in the unlikely event of losing, not directly on the expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual did consider the expected value, a key component of the decision reason, but their justification for choosing Lottery B was based on a different criterion (the magnitude of potential loss), rather than the expected value itself. This indicates that while the individual was aware of the expected values, the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) was not the primary basis for their choice, as both lotteries had the same expected value and the individual's decision was swayed by other factors."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason to the given decision problem, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (500 Euros * 1) = 500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, we find that the individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A as a key factor (""einen Gewinn sicher habe""). They also mention that the expected gain is the same for both lotteries (""Der erwartbare Gewinn ist bei beiden Lotterien jedoch gleich""). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on having a guaranteed win, despite acknowledging equal expected values.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the expected values and noted they were equal. However, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not directly apply since the expected values are equal. The individual's justification for the choice (guaranteed win) does not align with the decision reason's rule, which solely considers expected value. Given that the individual's decision was based on the certainty of the gain rather than strictly following the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, it suggests the decision reason was not the primary basis for the choice.

The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same expected value of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery A and viewed the potential loss of 1000 Euros as less severe compared to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because there is a chance to lose nothing and the potential loss seemed less severe compared to the certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration is more about the possibility of not losing and the perceived severity of losses rather than directly comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention expected values or a comparison based on them. Instead, the individual focuses on the chance of avoiding loss and the relative severity of potential losses.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived, and it indicates indifference between the two lotteries based on expected value alone.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered all possibilities and then re-examined the options, focusing on the expected gain and the probability of winning. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the perceived higher probability of winning, not explicitly on the expected value, even though they mention that the expected gain is the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (expected gain and probability of winning), it seems the individual was aware of the concept of expected gain but made the decision based on the probability of winning.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning because they perceived it as such, despite acknowledging equal expected gains), it appears the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason's rule since they chose based on a different criterion (winning probability) after acknowledging equal expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied by calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. 
- For Lottery A: EV = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros.
- For Lottery B: EV = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros.
Both lotteries have the same expected value, which is relevant information for the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual considered the options and noticed a parallel to another task.
- They thought about choosing A based on a previous experience with similar gains but were deterred by the higher loss amount in A.
- The individual preferred a higher probability of losing but with a lower amount.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The justification is based on the preference for a lower loss amount over the probability of losing, indicating a consideration of the potential losses and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (parallel to another task, higher loss amount, preference for lower loss):
- The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preference based on loss amounts and their probabilities):
- The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since it focuses on the aversion to higher loss amounts rather than comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of expected values to make the decision. Instead, it highlights a preference based on loss aversion and probability of loss, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = 5000 Euros * 0.1% + 0 Euros * 99.9% = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have an equal expected value, but the outcomes and their probabilities differ significantly.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the options, recalled a similar decision task, noted the equal expected values of the two lotteries, and recognized the significant difference in potential winnings and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the equal expected values, the probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B was extremely low, making the guaranteed 5 Euros in Lottery A more appealing for its certainty of winning something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the expected values and noted they were equal, which aligns with the decision reason's requirement. However, the individual's final choice was more influenced by the certainty of the outcome rather than strictly following the expected value rule.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest indifference since both lotteries have the same expected value. However, the individual preferred Lottery A due to its guaranteed payout, indicating that while the expected value was considered, it was not the sole or decisive factor in the choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual considered the expected values of the lotteries, which is a key component of the decision reason. However, the final decision was based more on the certainty of winning and the extremely low probability of the high payout in Lottery B, rather than strictly preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. Since the expected values were equal, the decision reason alone would not lead to a preference for one lottery over the other, but the individual's justification introduces additional considerations beyond just expected value, indicating the decision reason was not the primary basis for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-5 * 1) = -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible winnings of both lotteries and calculated the expected value of each, finding them to be the same (-5 Euros for both). They also considered the probability of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery A as very low and the loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B as certain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid the certainty of losing 5 Euros, despite both lotteries having the same expected value, because the significant loss in Lottery A was seen as highly unlikely to occur.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the expected values, which are central to the decision reason, and found them to be equal. However, the decision reason alone would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was not based solely on the expected value (since they acknowledged both lotteries had the same expected value) but on the desire to avoid a certain loss, even though the expected values were equal. This indicates the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, as they chose based on additional considerations (certainty of loss vs. probability of loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did consider the expected values of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. However, their choice was ultimately based on avoiding a certain loss rather than strictly following the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. Since both lotteries had the same expected value, and the individual's decision was swayed by factors outside the decision reason (probability of significant loss vs. certainty of a smaller loss), it's clear the decision reason was not the primary basis for their choice. Thus, the assessment is that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the options, looked at the potential outcomes, and thought about the risk of losing 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because its expected value is higher and to avoid the risk of losing 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value and the risk, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, and the individual chose Lottery A because its expected value is higher, which directly aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 2000 * 1 = 2000 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is that Lottery A has an expected value of 0 Euros and Lottery B has an expected value of 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential winnings of Lottery A, noting its expected value is 0 Euros, and recognized that Lottery B offers a sure win of 2000 Euros. They also acknowledged the higher potential gain of Lottery A but considered the risk of losing -3000 Euros.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certainty of winning 2000 Euros over the possibility of winning 3000 Euros due to the associated risk of losing -3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the expected outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) and the certain outcome of Lottery B (2000 Euros), which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice, it appears the individual made a decision based on a preference for certainty over potential higher gain with risk, rather than explicitly stating a preference for the higher expected value. However, the individual's consideration of the expected value of Lottery A and the certain value of Lottery B indicates an awareness of the expected values, even though the final decision seems to be more influenced by the desire for certainty.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual considered the expected values of the lotteries but based their decision more on the preference for certainty rather than explicitly choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. Therefore, while there is some alignment with the decision reason, the primary motivation behind the choice seems to differ, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is 1000 Euros * 1 = 1000 Euros. Since the EV of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A, the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes and their probabilities, which are given. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, recognizing it to be 0 Euros, and compared it with Lottery B, which offers a guaranteed 1000 Euros. They also considered the aspect of security versus risk, mentioning the preference for the certainty of winning 1000 Euros over the chance to win 3000 Euros with a 50% risk of losing 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B over Lottery A based on the mathematical comparison of expected values and a preference for security over risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of the lotteries, which is the key information for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which aligns with the individual’s mathematical comparison leading them to choose Lottery B because it has a higher expected value than Lottery A. Additionally, the individual's consideration of security versus risk further supports the alignment with the decision reason, as the preference for the certain outcome (1000 Euros) can be seen as a practical application of choosing the higher expected value in the context of their personal preferences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual directly mentions calculating and comparing the expected values of the two lotteries and uses this comparison as a primary reason for their decision, which perfectly aligns with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery B, the expected value is 0 Euros since it offers 0 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions looking at all options multiple times and notes that the expected value for both lotteries is the same.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B to avoid losing something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the expected values and correctly identified them as being equal.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding loss), it's clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries given their equal expected values, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (avoiding loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the fact that although the individual considered the expected values of the lotteries, their justification for choosing Lottery B (to avoid losing something) does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value, especially since the expected values are equal and the decision reason would suggest indifference."
