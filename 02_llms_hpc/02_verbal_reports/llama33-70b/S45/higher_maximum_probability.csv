STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome of 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% for the outcome of 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 2400 Euros
- Lottery B: 66% chance of 2400 Euros, 33% chance of 2500 Euros, and 1% chance of 0 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities of winning (Gewinnchancen) and the risks associated with each lottery, specifically mentioning that at Lottery B, there was a 99% chance of winning an amount equal to or greater than what could be won at Lottery A, with only a 1% risk of winning 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because they perceived the chances of winning to be higher and were willing to take the minimal risk (1% chance of 0 Euros) associated with it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the overall chances of winning and the associated risks, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of the maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% chance of winning. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different rationale, focusing on the perceived higher chances of winning and the acceptance of a minimal risk, rather than the maximum probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of winning. The individual's focus was on the overall risk and perceived chances of winning rather than the specific criterion of maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. In this case, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher maximum probability (67% vs 66%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared all possibilities, noting that Lotteries A and B are relatively similar. They focused on the probabilities, which they approximated to be around 1/3 for both, with Lottery B being 1% more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the small difference in potential winnings, Lottery B offered a 1% higher probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its higher probability of 0 Euros (67% vs 66%). However, the individual focused on the probabilities of winning (approximately 1/3 for both), not the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is to choose the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual chose based on the slightly higher probability of winning (1% more for Lottery B), not the maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason as defined, which prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Instead, the individual's decision was based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning, not the maximum probabilities of the outcomes."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% for winning 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain from Lottery A with an 80% probability and the guaranteed gain from Lottery B. They compared the difference in potential winnings (1000 Euros less for B) against the certainty of winning with B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the higher potential reward of Lottery A and the certainty of the reward from Lottery B, focusing on the fact that B offers a high gain with 100% probability, which is only 1000 Euros less than A’s potential.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and probabilities), we see that the individual did consider the probabilities, specifically highlighting the 100% probability of winning with Lottery B.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (emphasizing the 100% probability of B as a significant factor), it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with considering the maximum probability as a critical factor, given their emphasis on the 100% guarantee of Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report indicates a clear consideration of the maximum probability of each lottery, with a particular emphasis on the 100% probability of winning with Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability. This suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."
4,"dafür die Wahrscheinlichkeit etwas niedriger als bei B. Somit habe ich B gewählt, da hier die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu gewinnen mit 5% höher lag als bei A.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the maximum probability of each lottery. The relevant information for this reason is the probability of the highest outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 20% (the probability of winning 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 25% (the probability of winning 3000 Euros). This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the potential gain and the probability of winning for each lottery. They noted that Lottery A offers a higher gain but with a lower probability compared to Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the fact that the probability of winning with B is 5% higher than with A. This indicates the individual focused on the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries when making their decision.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual did focus on the probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery B with a 25% probability of winning. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B because it has a higher probability of winning (by 5%) directly aligns with the rule of the decision reason. Therefore, the information considered and the justification provided by the individual match the criteria and rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100"
5,"dafür ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 90% attraktiver für mich als nur zu 45% wie in Beispiel B. Daher habe ich die risikoärmere Wahl getroffen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% for a gain of 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% for a gain of 0 Euros, but since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability regardless of the outcome, we look at the highest probability associated with any outcome in each lottery. Thus, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 90% and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 55%. The information relevant to the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the comparison between the two lotteries, noting that the potential gain in Lottery A is half that of Lottery B but with a higher probability (90% vs. 45%). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its higher probability, which they find more attractive, leading them to choose the ""risikoärmere Wahl"" (less risky option).

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the probabilities associated with the positive outcomes), it's clear that the individual focused on the probabilities but specifically highlighted the attractiveness of the higher probability in Lottery A. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which aligns with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A based on its higher probability. However, the decision reason specifically considers the maximum probability without necessarily focusing on the outcome, whereas the individual's decision seems to weigh the probability against the potential gain, emphasizing the risk aspect.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 

This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, as the individual's justification aligns with preferring the higher probability. However, it's not a perfect match since the decision reason is solely about maximum probabilities, and the individual's decision seems to also consider the risk aspect in relation to the gain, not just the probability in isolation."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 99.9% (for 0 Euros) and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 99.8% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries (0.1% and 0.2%) and the amounts to be won. They also considered the high likelihood of ending up with 0 Euros in both cases.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the lower probability of winning, the potential gain was higher. They acknowledged the risk but decided to take it for the chance at a higher reward, assuming they would likely end up with 0 Euros anyway.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is related to the probability of not winning (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B). However, the individual's consideration was more on the probability of winning and the potential gain, rather than the maximum probability of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 99.9% probability of not winning. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the potential for a higher gain despite the lower probability of winning, not directly on the comparison of the maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's choice was influenced by the potential gain and the assumption of likely ending up with 0 Euros, rather than a direct comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for a loss of 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for a loss of 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability of 80% for a loss of 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B: Maximum probability of 100% for a loss of 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared both options and noted the difference in potential losses between A and B. They also considered the probability of losing 0 Euros in Lottery A (20% chance) versus the guaranteed loss in Lottery B (100% chance).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A despite its higher potential loss because of the 20% chance of losing nothing, which was not available in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 80% for A and 100% for B. The individual, however, focused on the difference in losses and the specific probabilities of certain outcomes (20% chance of no loss in A, 100% loss in B), not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (100% probability). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not mention the maximum probability as a deciding factor but rather the presence of a 20% chance of avoiding loss.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The individual's decision was influenced by the potential to avoid loss with a certain probability, not by directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the gains and losses of both options and noted the high probabilities of losses (20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of a loss was lower (20% compared to 25% for Lottery B), despite acknowledging the higher loss amount if the loss occurs.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability (which is the probability of the most likely outcome, 0 Euros in both cases), but the individual's main consideration was the probability of loss, not the maximum probability of any outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher maximum probability (80% for 0 Euros), but the individual's justification was based on the comparison of loss probabilities (20% vs. 25%), not the probabilities of the most likely outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the focus was on the probability of loss rather than the maximum probability of any outcome. However, the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its higher maximum probability) coincidentally matches the individual's choice, but for different reasons.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This score reflects that while the individual's choice coincides with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's criteria, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual to make the decision."
9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 90% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of each outcome for both lotteries, noting the 10% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A and the 55% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the potential losses and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential loss, the probability of not losing (getting 0 Euros) was at least half, which was more favorable compared to the 10% chance of not losing in Lottery A. They prioritized the higher probability of avoiding loss over the amount of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 90% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B. The individual considered the probabilities but focused more on the comparison of the probabilities of getting 0 Euros in each lottery rather than the maximum probabilities across all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with 90%. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the probability of avoiding loss being at least half, not directly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they did not prioritize the lottery with the higher maximum probability but instead focused on the probability of avoiding loss.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, the maximum probability for both lotteries is the probability of receiving 0 Euros (99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B). Since the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: 
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 99.9%
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 99.8%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the low probabilities of the negative outcomes in both lotteries and was deterred by the -6000 Euros in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because, despite being deterred by the -6000 Euros in Lottery A, they noticed that the probability of receiving -3000 Euros in Lottery B (0.2%) is higher than the probability of receiving -6000 Euros in Lottery A (0.1%). However, the focus here seems to be on the comparison of the probabilities of the negative outcomes rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B), while the individual focused on the probabilities of the negative outcomes (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B) and the magnitude of the negative outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.9% > 99.8%). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not align with this rule; instead, it's based on a comparison of the probabilities of the negative outcomes and their magnitudes. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for winning 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential winnings between Lotteries A and B (500 Euros vs. 1000 Euros) and the risk associated with Lottery B (50% probability of winning).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the difference in potential winnings was not high enough to take a 50% risk, leading them to choose the certain 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the risk (probability) and the potential winnings but not explicitly the maximum probability as a standalone criterion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of winning. The individual chose Lottery A but justified it based on the risk and potential reward rather than explicitly stating a preference for the higher maximum probability.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) but the justification provided does not directly match the decision reason's rule (focusing on maximum probability). The individual's focus was more on the risk-reward tradeoff rather than the maximum probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for the choice. The justification provided by the individual focuses on different aspects (risk and reward difference) rather than the maximum probability, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary consideration."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of -500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not having a loss with Lottery B, acknowledged the 50/50 risk, and was influenced by the presence of a 2000 Euro bonus which made them willing to take the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance to avoid loss, despite recognizing the high risk, and the bonus made the risk more acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's considerations were more about the presence of risk and the potential for no loss, along with the influence of a bonus. The individual did not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a 100% probability for one of its outcomes, which is higher than any probability in Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the potential to avoid loss and the bonus, not on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes. The individual's focus was on the risk, potential for no loss, and the bonus, without mention of comparing the probabilities as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), but since there are multiple outcomes with the same highest probability, we also note that there are outcomes with 25% probability each for 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros. However, according to the reason, the focus is on the maximum probability, which is 50% for Lottery A. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery: 75% for Lottery B and 50% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the number of possibilities to win and the associated probabilities, noting that Lottery A offers more possibilities to win with a 50% chance of not winning (implied by the 50% probability of 0 Euros), compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it seemed ""sicherer"" (safer), implying a preference for the option with potentially more stable or guaranteed outcomes, given the comparison of probabilities and the presence of more winning possibilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the number of possibilities to win and the associated probabilities, particularly focusing on the aspect of safety or stability (implied by the term ""sicherere Variante"").
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Instead, the individual emphasizes the aspect of safety and the presence of more winning possibilities in Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual's focus was more on the perceived safety and the distribution of winning possibilities rather than the maximum probability of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros).
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros).
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of loss and the magnitude of potential loss for both lotteries, focusing on the higher loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by considering the risk of a high loss, suggesting a preference for a lower potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, whereas the individual focused on the probability and magnitude of loss, not directly on the maximum probability of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason’s rule is about preferring the higher maximum probability, which does not directly align with the individual’s justification that emphasizes avoiding high losses.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was more on the potential losses and their magnitudes rather than on the maximum probabilities of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for winning 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The information is: Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 99.9%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the high probability of winning 0 Euros (99.9%) in Lottery B and the guarantee of winning 5 Euros in Lottery A. They also acknowledged the low probability of winning a high amount in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that, despite 5 Euros being a relatively small amount, they would rather have this than 0 Euros, indicating a preference for a guaranteed, albeit small, win over a highly probable loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual. The individual did consider the high probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B and the certainty of winning in Lottery A, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B is based on preferring a guaranteed win (5 Euros) over a highly probable loss (0 Euros), which aligns with preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability for a positive outcome (in this case, any win is a positive outcome compared to 0 Euros).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, closely aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability for a positive outcome. The individual's focus on the high probability of winning nothing in Lottery B and the guarantee of winning something in Lottery A, and their justification for choosing the guaranteed win, indicates that they used a reasoning process consistent with the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is that the individual certainly used the decision reason to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for losing 5 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery B. They also thought about the low probability but high magnitude of loss in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery A, the potential for such a large loss was daunting, even though the most likely outcome in Lottery A was winning 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused more on the outcomes and their associated probabilities rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the avoidance of a large potential loss and the certainty of a small loss), it seems the individual's decision was not directly based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries but rather on the perceived risk and certainty of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on avoiding a potential large loss and the certainty of a small loss, rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 100% for a gain of 1500 Euros
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the possibilities of each lottery, noting that Lottery A offers half the gain of Lottery B but with a 100% probability, whereas Lottery B has a 50% chance of both gain and loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual preferred the certain decision with a 100% gain, indicating a preference for the guaranteed outcome over the risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes, focusing on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the maximum probability of each lottery. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with a 100% probability for a gain. The individual's justification also favors the certain gain, suggesting alignment with the decision reason's rule. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritized the lottery with the higher maximum probability (100% for Lottery A).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the gain and loss outcomes). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the gain outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential higher gain of Lottery A, the risk of loss in the previous round, and the certainty of gain in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to take the safe option after potentially losing money in a previous round, despite acknowledging the lower potential gain compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential gain, risk of loss in a previous round, certainty of gain). The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose the safe option due to previous potential loss and despite the lower gain). The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the gain and past experiences rather than the comparison of maximum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason (comparing maximum probabilities) to make the decision. Instead, the decision was influenced by the desire for a certain gain after a potential previous loss and the acknowledgment of lower potential gain in Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all possibilities and weighing the risk of Lottery B against its potential gain, noting that the 50% chance of winning or losing is too high a risk, even though the potential gain is three times higher than in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by emphasizing the risk associated with Lottery B, implying that the certainty of gain in Lottery A is preferred over the gamble of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk associated with the 50% chance of winning or losing in Lottery B, and the certainty of gain in Lottery A), we see that while the individual discusses the risk, they do not explicitly mention the maximum probability as the basis for their decision.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (emphasis on risk and certainty), it appears that the individual's justification aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher maximum probability (Lottery A, with 100% probability of gain), but does not directly state this as the reason.
Given these comparisons, while the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason, the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the maximum probabilities as the decision criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not explicitly mention the maximum probability as the decision criterion, leaving some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 50% probability of losing -6000 Euros as being too risky. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it involves neither gain nor loss, implying a preference for avoiding risk. The described deliberation process focuses on the risk aspect and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and certainty of outcomes), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the maximum probability as defined by the decision reason. Instead, the individual focused on the presence or absence of risk. However, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) would lead to preferring Lottery A because it has a 100% probability of a certain outcome, aligning with the individual's choice but not necessarily for the same reason. The individual's justification emphasizes risk avoidance rather than the comparison of maximum probabilities. Therefore, while the outcome chosen by the individual aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's criteria.
