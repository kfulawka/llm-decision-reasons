STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. The decision reason focuses on the minimum outcome of each lottery, which can be directly derived from the information given about the lotteries. Therefore, we can apply this reason.

Next, we identify the minimum outcomes for each lottery:
- For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, which occurs with a 1% probability.
- For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros, which occurs with a 100% probability.

Now, we apply the decision reason. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome. Comparing the minimum outcomes:
- Lottery A's minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
- Lottery B's minimum outcome is 2400 Euros.

Since 2400 Euros is more favorable than 0 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.
