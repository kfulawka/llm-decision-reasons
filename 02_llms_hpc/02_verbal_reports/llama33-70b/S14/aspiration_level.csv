STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, (2500-1825), (2400-1825), and (0-1825); for Lottery A, (2400-1825). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Relevant information includes the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probability of earning at least as much with Lottery B as with Lottery A, mentioning a 99% chance. This indicates the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the high probability of earning at least as much as with Lottery A, indicating a focus on the likelihood of achieving a certain level of earnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and this level) with that considered by the individual (probability of earning at least as much with Lottery B as with Lottery A), there seems to be a partial overlap in focus on outcomes but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual's justification (focusing on the high probability of earning at least as much as with Lottery A), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since the aspiration level and its direct comparison are not mentioned. However, the individual's focus on the probability of achieving a certain earnings level indirectly relates to the concept of comparing outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of differences from this level as outlined in the decision reason. While there is a focus on the probability of achieving certain earnings, which is somewhat related to the concept of positive differences, it does not align closely with the specific rule of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but with some minor elements of the decision process vaguely related to the reason's principles."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 2500 - 1225 = 1275, 0 - 1225 = -1225, 2400 - 1225 = 1175, and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference (2400 Euros) and Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference (2500 Euros), the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual compared the outcomes of Lottery A and Lottery B (A E1 with B E1), specifically mentioning the 1% difference in probabilities and the 100 Euro difference in outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that the 1% difference in probabilities is not significant enough to justify earning 100 Euros less.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and probabilities of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (1% difference in probabilities, 100 Euro difference in outcomes). The individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the difference in earnings and the probability difference). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason to make the decision, as they did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason. The individual's focus on the difference in earnings and the probability difference does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level = (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the last two probabilities and the amount of 3,000 Euros as a sufficient sum.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual did not want to worsen the probability for an additional 1,000 Euros, indicating a focus on the trade-off between the amount of money and the probability of receiving it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the sufficiency of the 3,000 Euros and the trade-off with probability, which indirectly relates to the concept of aspiration level but does not directly calculate or mention it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification implies a preference for a certain outcome over a riskier one with a higher potential reward, aligning with preferring positive differences (in this case, the guaranteed 3,000 Euros over the risk of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B).

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the sufficiency of the amount and the reluctance to take on more risk for a higher potential reward suggests an alignment with the principle of preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (or less negative) deviations from an aspiration level, even though the aspiration level itself is not explicitly calculated or mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 4000 - 1750 = 2250, 0 - 1750 = -1750, 3000 - 1750 = 1250, and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information for the decision reason: 
- Aspiration level: 1750 Euros
- Differences: 2250, -1750, 1250, -1750
- Probabilities of positive differences for each lottery: For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 3000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared the two outcomes and considered the higher risk and potential for higher winnings. They also considered the 5% difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual preferred taking on more risk to potentially win more, indicating that the 5% higher probability (of winning something in Lottery A, implied from context) was not enough to make them choose the lower potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the potential for higher winnings and the difference in probabilities, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences to it.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A because it has a 25% chance of exceeding the aspiration level, whereas Lottery B has a 20% chance. The individual's justification focuses on the willingness to take more risk for higher potential winnings and the insufficient difference in probabilities to choose the lower winnings, which does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about probabilities of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

Considering these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process involved risk preference and potential winnings but did not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly mention or imply the use of an aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus was more on the risk and potential winnings, which, while related, does not directly align with the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report does not explicitly mention calculations or specific probabilities and outcomes but emphasizes a preference for a ""sicheren, kleineren Taler"" (a certain, smaller amount) over risking getting nothing. This implies the individual considered the aspect of certainty and the avoidance of getting nothing.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to be based on a preference for certainty and avoiding the risk of getting nothing, rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries' outcomes and an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (certainty, avoiding risk of getting nothing). There's a partial overlap in that both consider the outcomes, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty and avoiding risk). The individual's justification aligns with preferring a more certain outcome (Lottery B offers a higher probability of a positive outcome), but it does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's emphasis on preferring a certain, smaller amount over risking nothing partially aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (since Lottery B, which is preferred by the reason due to its higher probability of a positive outcome, offers a more certain gain), but the verbal report does not demonstrate a clear application of the decision reason's specific criteria (aspiration level, differences, and probabilities of positive differences). Thus, while there's a superficial alignment in the preference for the more certain option, the underlying reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros; for 6000 Euros, the difference is 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive differences are associated with winning (3000 Euros or 6000 Euros), we need to calculate the probability of winning for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of winning (and thus having a positive difference) is 0.2%, and for Lottery B, it is 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the two outcomes and considered the low probabilities of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because the probability of winning 3000 Euros is so low that they might as well choose the lottery with the higher potential win (6000 Euros), implying a consideration of the potential outcomes in relation to their perceived value or appeal given the low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, which aligns with the information needed to apply the decision reason. However, the aspiration level and the concept of positive differences from this level are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual's justification seems to focus more on the absolute potential win given the low probabilities rather than the relative differences from an aspiration level. The individual's reasoning does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of using an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual considers the outcomes and their low probabilities, the justification provided does not explicitly reflect the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the consideration of outcomes and probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference (1000) and an 80% chance of a negative difference (-3000), while Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference since its outcome is always -2000 away from the aspiration level. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of loss (80% Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit) and the idea of having a fixed loss (festen Verlust).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize having a fixed loss over the possibility of a variable loss, even if the variable loss has a lower expected value. This is indicated by the statement ""da würde ich lieber mit einem festen Verlust rechnen können,"" which translates to ""I would rather be able to count on a fixed loss.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discusses the probability of loss and the preference for a fixed loss, without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 20% chance of a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level. However, the individual's justification emphasizes a preference for a fixed loss, which aligns more closely with choosing Lottery B, as it offers a certain, albeit fixed, loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The individual's emphasis on preferring a fixed loss over a variable loss, regardless of the probabilities involved, suggests a different decision-making process than the one outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as: AL = (-3000 + 0 - 4000 + 0) / 4 = -4000 / 4 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery A are: (-3000 - (-1000)) = -2000 Euros and (0 - (-1000)) = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are: (-4000 - (-1000)) = -3000 Euros and (0 - (-1000)) = 1000 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 1000 Euros with probabilities of 75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared Lottery A (E1) and Lottery B (E2), focusing on the difference in potential losses and the probability of losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the difference in potential loss compared to Lottery A is not as high, and the probability of losing is perceived as lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the differences in potential losses and the probabilities of losing, which seems to align with the concept of evaluating outcomes in relation to a reference point (aspiration level) but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on a perceived lower difference in potential loss and a lower probability of losing, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring the higher probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason provided, especially in terms of calculating an aspiration level and prioritizing the probability of positive differences from it. While there's a mention of comparing differences and probabilities, the focus and the specific rule applied do not directly match the decision reason. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there's a slight possibility of some indirect influence, hence the assessment is closer to certainty of non-use than complete uncertainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level (-2250 Euros), the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level (-3750, 2250 for Lottery A; -750, 2250 for Lottery B), and the probabilities associated with these differences (45% for -3750, 55% for 2250 in Lottery A; 90% for -750, 10% for 2250 in Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the lotteries and comparing the potential losses (3k vs 6k), also acknowledging the higher probability of the 3k loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their potential choice by stating they could more easily tolerate a 3k loss than a 6k loss, even though the probability of the 3k loss is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential losses and their comparability, which aligns with considering differences from an aspiration level, though the aspiration level itself is not explicitly mentioned.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the ease of tolerating losses, which indirectly relates to the preference for outcomes relative to a certain threshold (aspiration level), but does not explicitly discuss probabilities of positive differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's consideration of loss tolerance and implicit comparison of outcomes suggests some alignment with the decision reason's focus on differences from an aspiration level. However, the explicit consideration of probabilities and the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences are not clearly articulated in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30

This assessment reflects that while there are elements in the verbal report that suggest the individual considered aspects related to the decision reason (such as comparing losses), the explicit use of the aspiration level and the rule regarding probabilities of positive differences are not clearly evident. Thus, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there is some indication of related considerations, leading to an assessment below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus calculated as: (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being better than -2250 Euros) and a 0.1% chance of a negative difference. Lottery B has a 99.8% chance of a positive difference and a 0.2% chance of a negative difference. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the outcomes, specifically focusing on the -6000 Euros outcome of Lottery A and its low probability, indicating an awareness of the potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the significant loss associated with Lottery A (""6k.. auch wenn die Wahrscheinlichkeit sehr gering ist, zu verlieren wäre für mich zu viel""), suggesting that the potential loss, despite its low probability, was a decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries. Instead, the individual focuses on the potential significant loss of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A due to its 99.9% chance of a positive outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B's 99.8%. However, the individual's justification centers around avoiding the significant loss, not explicitly on comparing the probabilities of positive outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's emphasis on avoiding a significant loss, despite its low probability, does not reflect the decision reason's specific criteria for choosing between the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros; for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of getting 500 Euros from Lottery B and the potential to invest it to make more, as well as the lower probability of getting 1000 Euros from Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the certainty of getting 500 Euros from Lottery B and the potential to invest it, compared to the lower probability of getting 1000 Euros from Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual does consider the certainty of outcomes and the potential for growth, which could be related to the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the outcome from Lottery B and its potential for growth, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from a calculated aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The report focuses more on the certainty of the outcome from Lottery B and its potential for investment, rather than explicitly calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While there is a vague connection between the certainty and potential for growth considered by the individual and the concept of aspiration levels, it does not clearly align with the specific rule of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but with some minor consideration of related concepts."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery A, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome), and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the probability of losing nothing (0 Euros) in Lottery B versus the certainty of losing 500 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to take the chance (50% probability) of not losing anything rather than losing 500 Euros for sure. This indicates the individual values the possibility of avoiding a loss, which aligns with considering differences from a certain reference point (like an aspiration level).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual’s consideration of avoiding a loss and taking a chance on not losing anything can be interpreted as focusing on the potential for a ""positive"" outcome (not losing) versus a certain loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B because it offers a 50% chance of not losing (a positive difference from the aspiration level of -500 Euros). The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B is based on preferring a 50% chance of not losing anything over a certain loss, which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome (or less negative, in this context).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, aligns with the core concept of the decision reason, which involves preferring an option based on the probability of achieving a better outcome relative to a reference point (aspiration level). While the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences, their focus on avoiding a certain loss in favor of a chance at no loss reflects a similar underlying preference structure as the decision reason. However, the lack of explicit mention of these key components of the decision reason prevents a perfect match, hence the assessment is not 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2400 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1600 Euros (4000-2400), -1400 Euros (2000-2400), and -2400 Euros (0-2400); for Lottery B, 3600 Euros (6000-2400) and -2400 Euros (0-2400). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 25% chance of a positive difference of 1600 Euros, 25% chance of a negative difference of -1400 Euros, and 50% chance of a negative difference of -2400 Euros.
- Lottery B: 25% chance of a positive difference of 3600 Euros, and 75% chance of a negative difference of -2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered where they could most likely win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they could win at least a nice sum with 50% probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the probability of winning at least a nice sum, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason.

14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Relevant information for this reason includes the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes that are better than this level in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered how long it would take to earn back the potential losses (6k for Lottery A, 2k/4k for Lottery B) and compared the loss amounts and their probabilities between the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the magnitude of potential losses and their recoverability, noting that although the probability of losing is higher in Lottery B, the loss amount is smaller and more manageable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level, whereas the individual considered the recoverability of losses and the magnitude of loss amounts. There's a conceptual overlap in considering the impact of losses, but the individual's focus does not directly align with calculating an aspiration level or explicitly comparing probabilities of outcomes better than this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of outcomes better than the aspiration level, while the individual preferred the lottery with potentially smaller, more manageable losses, despite a higher probability of losing. The individual's justification touches on the concept of loss aversion and manageability rather than directly applying the rule based on an aspiration level and probabilities of exceeding it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While there's a conceptual overlap in considering the impact of losses, the individual's justification is more closely related to loss aversion and the practicality of recovering from losses rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make their decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1683.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 5000 - 1683.33 = 3316.67 and 0 - 1683.33 = -1683.33; for Lottery A, 5 - 1683.33 = -1678.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probability of a positive difference in Lottery B is 0.1% and in Lottery A is 0%, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the idea of having ""something little"" (in German: ""etwas wenig Geld"") as opposed to ""no money"" (in German: ""gar keinem Geld"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they prefer having a small amount of money over having no money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the general idea of having some money versus no money, without explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on a preference for having some money over none, which aligns with avoiding the negative difference (having no money) but does not explicitly address the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on having some money versus no money aligns with avoiding negative outcomes but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was used, although it touches on the general idea of preferring positive outcomes. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but allows for a small possibility due to the alignment on preferring positive outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros, 0 Euros, and -5 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (-5000 + 0 + (-5)) / 3 = -5005 / 3 = -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 for -5000 Euros, 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 for 0 Euros, and -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 for -5 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is negative, a positive difference means an outcome higher than -1671.67 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros is above the aspiration level with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery A, the outcome of -5 Euros is also above the aspiration level but with a probability of 100%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B and mentions the low chance of losing 5000 Euros. They also mention the fixed loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A but express confidence in being able to recover this amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual tends towards Lottery B because of its high probability of resulting in 0 Euros, despite acknowledging the small risk of a significant loss. They seem to downplay the potential loss of 5000 Euros, suggesting they believe they could recover from it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes against it, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or compare outcomes in such a calculated manner. They focus on the probabilities and potential recoverability of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of outcomes above the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while considering probabilities, does not explicitly mention comparing outcomes against an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level. Instead, they seem to weigh the likelihood of outcomes and their personal ability to recover from potential losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's specific rule of comparing outcomes to an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences. The individual's focus is more on the practical aspects of the outcomes and their personal confidence in recovering from potential losses, rather than on a calculated aspiration level and its implications. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros.
- Lottery A offers 1500 Euros.
The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500.
- For Lottery A: 1500 - 500 = 1000.
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 
Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1000), and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (2500) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-3500).
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information for the reason includes the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions considering the probability of losing and the security of having 1,500 Euros in hand, implying they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by preferring the security of 1,500 Euros over the potential loss of 3,000 Euros, indicating a focus on avoiding loss and valuing certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual’s focus on security and avoiding loss as described.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual’s justification emphasizes the avoidance of potential loss and the value of a certain gain, not explicitly the probability of positive differences.
Based on these comparisons, while the individual’s decision to prefer Lottery A could align with the outcome of the decision reason (since Lottery A provides a certain positive outcome relative to the aspiration level), the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences based on an aspiration level calculated from the mean of all outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's justification focuses on security and avoiding loss rather than explicitly on the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level, indicating that while the decision outcome might align with the decision reason, the reasoning process described does not clearly follow the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level and the differences can be calculated from the given outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be considering the idea of preferring a certain, smaller gain over a risky option that could result in a larger loss than what they currently have. This is indicated by the phrase ""Lieber den Spatz in der Hand als die Taube auf'm Dach,"" which translates to ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"" suggesting a preference for certainty over risk.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for having a smaller, certain amount of money rather than risking losing more than they currently have. This is further emphasized by ""lieber einen kleineren Betrag sicher haben als mit einem Risiko mehr zu verlieren, als man schon hat,"" which translates to ""rather have a smaller amount for sure than to risk losing more than one already has."" This suggests the individual is prioritizing avoiding loss and valuing certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss, without explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: While the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, the individual's justification revolves around preferring certainty and avoiding potential large losses. Although both involve risk aversion, the specific criteria (aspiration level and probability of positive differences) mentioned in the decision reason are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific steps and criteria outlined in the decision reason, even though both reflect a risk-averse attitude. The individual's focus is more on the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of potential large losses rather than on the calculated aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as specifically defined, was used by the individual, given the lack of direct reference to the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences in the verbal report. However, it does not rule out that the individual's decision-making process might share some underlying principles with the decision reason, such as risk aversion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 0. 
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 0 = 3000 and -3000 - 0 = -3000.
- For Lottery A: 1000 - 0 = 1000.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% probability of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing probabilities and considering the security of the choice (""den sicheren Weg"").
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose the ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way) because they prefer ""den Spatz in der Hand"" (a bird in the hand), implying a preference for a certain outcome over a risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual’s focus on the security of the choice and the preference for a certain outcome.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its 100% probability of a positive outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring a certain outcome, which indirectly aligns with the outcome of the decision reason but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations of the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While the individual's choice and the decision reason's preference both lead to choosing Lottery A, the underlying reasoning processes appear to differ. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and -6000 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (0 + 6000 - 6000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 0 - 0 = 0, 6000 - 0 = 6000, and -6000 - 0 = -6000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing probabilities and considering the potential loss of 6k Euros, indicating they looked at the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on their reluctance to lose 6k Euros, suggesting that the potential for loss was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences from this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the potential loss and compared probabilities, which aligns with considering outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B in this scenario because it has a 50% chance of a positive outcome (6000 Euros), whereas Lottery A has no chance of a positive outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability). However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize avoiding loss, which could indirectly relate to the concept of positive differences but doesn't directly apply the rule as stated.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and comparing probabilities shows some alignment with the considerations involved in the decision reason, but there is no clear indication that the aspiration level was calculated or that the preference was based on the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there are some related concepts, the direct application of the decision reason as described is not evident in the verbal report."
