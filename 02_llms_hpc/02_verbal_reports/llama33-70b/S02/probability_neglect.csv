STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a fixed outcome of 2400 Euros, while Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of 2500 Euros. The probabilities of the lotteries can be derived and compared. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (2500 Euros for Lottery B and 2400 Euros for Lottery A) and the assessment of the probability differences as negligible or not. Since the decision reason can be applied by comparing these maximum outcomes and considering the negligible probability differences, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing (0 Euros) in Lottery B and the potential gain of 100 Euros (implied by the difference between 2500 Euros and 2400 Euros) as factors in their decision. They mention the low probability of 0 Euros in Lottery B, indicating they are aware of the probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning the very low probability of losing and the potential, not entirely unlikely, gain of the extra 100 Euros. This suggests they weighed the potential benefits against the very low risk of the worst outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and considers probability differences negligible. The individual considered the potential gain (maximum outcome difference) and the very low probability of the worst outcome, aligning with considering the maximum outcome and acknowledging the low impact of the worst outcome's probability.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual chose Lottery B, which has a more favorable maximum outcome (2500 Euros vs. 2400 Euros), and justified this choice by referencing the potential gain and the negligible risk of the worst outcome, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus on the potential gain (the difference in maximum outcomes) and their acknowledgment of the low probability of the worst outcome in Lottery B suggest they used a reasoning process that aligns with the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that they ignored or deemed negligible the differences in probabilities between the two lotteries based on a thorough comparison of all outcomes and their probabilities. The individual's reasoning seems to be influenced by the potential upside and the minimal downside risk, which is consistent with preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome but does not fully articulate the consideration of probability differences as negligible.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the maximum outcomes are 2400 Euros and 2500 Euros, respectively. The probabilities of winning are 34% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B, which can be considered negligible in difference (1% difference). Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (2500 Euros for B and 2400 Euros for A) and the assessment that the probability difference (1%) is negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the maximum outcomes (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1%) between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risky variant), implying they chose the option with the potentially higher payoff despite slightly lower probability, because the probability difference was not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered both the outcome difference and the negligible probability difference, aligning with the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligibly different. The individual chose the lottery with the higher maximum outcome (Lottery B, 2500 Euros) because the difference in probabilities was not significant, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of both the maximum outcomes and the negligible difference in probabilities, along with their choice justification based on these factors, strongly suggests that they used the decision reason to make their decision. The verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's criteria for preferring one lottery over the other, indicating a high certainty that the decision reason was used."
3,"inn bei Lotterie B (auch da es sich um relativ hohe Summen handelt -> besser haben als Spielen)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a guaranteed 3000 Euros, while Lottery B offers 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The maximum outcome of Lottery B (4000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (3000 Euros). The decision reason can be applied by comparing these outcomes and considering the probability differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""Sicherheitsbedürfnis"" (need for security) and not wanting to gamble with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially considering the high sums involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the desire for security and avoiding the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and considers probability differences negligible. The individual, however, focuses on the security aspect and the risk of not winning in Lottery B, rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, is centered around avoiding risk and valuing security, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align closely with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on security and risk avoidance does not indicate a consideration of the maximum outcomes in the manner described by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 25% probability, and Lottery B offers 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The maximum outcomes are 4000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A. The difference in probabilities is 5% (25% - 20%), which could be considered negligible depending on the individual's perspective. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the lotteries (4000 Euros for B, 3000 Euros for A) and the difference in their probabilities (5%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential for a higher win in Lottery B and noted that the probability difference of 5% did not seem significant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the higher potential gain of Lottery B and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of the probability differences. The individual considered the higher potential win (maximum outcome) of Lottery B and the small difference in probabilities, aligning with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its higher maximum outcome and the belief that the 5% probability difference is not significant, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns closely with the decision reason, considering both the maximum outcomes and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90 
This assessment indicates a high degree of certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the close alignment between the decision reason's criteria and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B. However, it is not a perfect match, as the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on a rule of preferring the higher maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, hence not a 100% certainty."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 90% probability, and Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The maximum outcome of Lottery B (6000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (3000 Euros). However, the probability difference (90% for A vs. 45% for B) is significant, not negligible. Thus, while the reason can technically be applied, its conditions regarding negligible probability differences are not met in this scenario.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual was attracted to the 90% probability of winning in Lottery A and found the less than 50% probability of Lottery B unappealing. They also mention the higher potential winnings of Lottery B but seem to prioritize the higher probability of winning in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the low probability of winning in Lottery B, which discouraged them from choosing Lottery B despite its higher potential payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences, but the individual's focus was more on the probabilities themselves rather than their differences being negligible.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible, but the individual chose based on the attractiveness of the high probability of winning in Lottery A, not directly because of the maximum outcome being more favorable in Lottery B.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's choice was influenced by the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the deterrent effect of the low probability in Lottery B, rather than a comparison of maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences.

6,"o verschwindend gering war das Gefühl, dass es relativ egal ist und ich dann ja auch auf den höheren Gewinn setzen kann

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In the given lotteries, A and B, the probabilities of winning are 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Although these probabilities are very low, the difference between them (0.1%) is also very small, which could be considered negligible. The maximum outcomes are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and it would prefer Lottery B due to its more favorable maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the probability of winning is ""verschwindend gering"" (extremely low), which indicates they considered the low probabilities of both lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that because the probability of winning is extremely low, it feels ""relativ egal"" (relatively equal), and they decide to go for the higher win, implying they chose based on the maximum possible outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the low probabilities and the maximum outcomes, aligning with the decision reason's criteria.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual’s justification (choosing the higher win because the probabilities are extremely low and thus relatively equal), we find a strong alignment. The individual's justification mirrors the decision reason's rule, suggesting that the decision reason was likely used.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90
This assessment indicates a high level of certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, based on the alignment between the decision reason's criteria and the individual's justification for their choice, as described in the verbal report. However, it's not a perfect match due to the subjective interpretation of ""negligible"" probability differences and the individual's informal description of their decision process."
7,"ist, erschienen mir die 20% für icht-Verlust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. For Lottery B, there's a 20% chance of 0 Euros (no loss) and an 80% chance of -4000 Euros. For Lottery A, there's a 100% chance of -3000 Euros. The maximum outcome (most favorable in terms of loss being less) for Lottery B is 0 Euros (20% chance of no loss), and for Lottery A, it's -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the probabilities associated with these outcomes. However, the reason specifically considers the differences in probabilities as negligible, which might not directly apply here due to the significant difference in probability distributions (0% chance of no loss in A vs. 20% in B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the definitive loss aspect of both lotteries and weighed the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B against the higher loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seemed to justify their choice based on the trade-off between the probability of avoiding loss (20% in Lottery B) and the amount of loss in each lottery, suggesting that the potential to avoid loss in Lottery B was not worth the increased potential loss compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and considers negligible probability differences. The individual considered the potential for no loss and the amount of loss, which aligns with focusing on outcomes but also heavily weighs the probability of those outcomes, not necessarily treating the probability differences as negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, indicates a consideration of both the outcome and the probability, not necessarily prioritizing the maximum outcome solely based on its favorability without considering the probability of achieving that outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason provided, particularly because the individual heavily considered the probabilities of the outcomes, not treating them as negligible. The focus on the trade-off between the amount of potential loss and the probability of avoiding loss does not directly match the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used this specific decision reason to make their choice."
8,"summe entschieden (vermutlich weil 4000€ doch erschreckend viel klingt)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences in probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum outcome of -3000 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of -4000 Euros. The probabilities of the lotteries are 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B, with a 5% difference. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A, -4000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (25% for A, 20% for B). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential losses (5% difference between the probabilities) and the magnitude of the potential losses (4000 Euros being ""erschreckend viel"", or frighteningly much).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the smaller loss amount, implying that the magnitude of the potential loss was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's consideration of the 5% probability difference suggests they did not consider this difference negligible. However, the individual's focus on the magnitude of the losses aligns with considering the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (less negative), which is Lottery A with -3000 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing the smaller loss amount (Lottery A) aligns with this rule, but their reasoning is based more on the perceived impact of the loss rather than explicitly stating the probabilities are negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision to choose Lottery A because of its smaller loss amount aligns with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the individual's consideration of the probability difference and the emotional impact of the larger loss introduces uncertainty about whether they truly considered the probability differences negligible as the decision reason requires. Therefore, while there is alignment in the outcome choice, the process described in the verbal report does not perfectly match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a score above the midpoint but not at certainty."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's -3000 Euros. The probabilities of winning (or in this case, losing) are 45% for A and 90% for B. The decision reason can be applied by comparing these outcomes and probabilities. However, it's crucial to note that the probability differences here (45% vs. 90%) are quite significant, not negligible, which might already suggest a deviation from the decision reason's criteria.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the initial results, considered the higher potential loss in Lottery A but also its lower probability compared to the more probable but less severe loss in Lottery B. They expressed uncertainty due to the trade-off between the magnitude of loss and its probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after hesitation, citing the probability of loss being ""under 50%"" as a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's deliberation heavily weighs the probabilities and their comparison, not just the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are deemed negligible. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the probability being under 50% for Lottery A, indicating that the probability itself, not just the outcome, played a crucial role in their decision.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason, as they considered the probability differences significant enough to impact their choice, contrary to the reason's premise of negligible probability differences.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a maximum loss of -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and Lottery B offers a maximum loss of -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) are indeed very close, and their difference could be considered negligible. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes (-6000 Euros for A, -3000 Euros for B) and the negligible difference in probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as ""definitiv beängstigender"" (definitely more frightening) and notes that the difference in probabilities is ""äußerst minimal"" (extremely minimal). This indicates the individual considered the maximum loss amount and the probability difference.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the fear associated with the larger loss and acknowledges the minimal difference in probabilities but does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum outcome in a positive context. Instead, the fear of the larger loss seems to guide their deliberation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the maximum loss and the minimal probability difference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's justification seems to be more about avoiding the larger loss due to fear rather than explicitly preferring a more favorable maximum outcome. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual preferred one lottery over the other based on having a ""more favorable"" maximum outcome in a general sense; instead, it highlights fear of loss.

Given these comparisons, while the individual considers aspects relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences), their justification seems more fear-driven regarding the loss rather than a straightforward application of preferring a more favorable maximum outcome due to negligible probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are some elements in the verbal report that align with the decision reason (consideration of outcomes and probability differences), the primary driver of the individual's decision appears to be the fear of the larger loss rather than a direct application of the decision reason's rule to prefer based on the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are nearly equal."
11,"cheint mir hier attraktiver, sicher Geld zu bekommen (das zusätzliche Guthaben hat mich in diesem Fall nicht risikobereiter gemacht)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum (and guaranteed) outcome is 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the assessment of probability differences. Since Lottery B has a 100% probability of its outcome, and Lottery A has a 50% probability of its maximum outcome, the probability differences are not negligible according to most interpretations. However, the decision reason's core is to compare maximum outcomes when probability differences are deemed negligible, so we need to see how the individual approached this in their verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to focus on the attractiveness of receiving money securely, implying they considered the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries as a significant factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual mentions that the prospect of getting money securely appears more attractive, especially in contrast to previous experiences with losses. This suggests they are prioritizing the certainty of a gain over the potential for a higher but riskier gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's verbal report emphasizes the attractiveness of a secure gain, which aligns more with considering the certainty of an outcome rather than comparing maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification emphasizes security over potential maximum gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's focus is on avoiding risk rather than maximizing potential gain under conditions of similar risk, as implied by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the understanding that the individual's decision-making process, as described, prioritizes the security of a guaranteed outcome over the potential for a higher gain, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes under the specific condition of negligible probability differences. The individual's emphasis on security and risk avoidance does not indicate the use of the decision reason as described."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros (which is more favorable than the maximum outcome of Lottery A, which is -500 Euros), and Lottery A has a fixed outcome with 100% probability, while Lottery B has a 50% probability of a negative outcome and a 50% probability of a neutral outcome. The probabilities of the lotteries can be derived and compared. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (-500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B) and the consideration that the probability differences between the two lotteries could be seen as negligible due to the specific nature of Lottery A having a 100% chance of a negative outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional funds, suggesting they considered their personal financial situation and how it might affect their risk-taking behavior. They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive, indicating they considered the outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to have been influenced by the idea of not wanting a guaranteed loss (Variante A) and possibly by the appeal of the less risky option in terms of potential for a better outcome (Variante B), even though they describe it as ""risk-freudigere"" (more thrill-seeking or risk-loving), which might suggest an attraction to the gamble itself.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of not having a guaranteed loss (which aligns with preferring a more favorable maximum outcome), but their deliberation also included personal financial considerations and risk appetite, which are not directly part of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification focuses on avoiding a guaranteed loss and possibly the thrill of the gamble, which indirectly aligns with preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (Lottery B) but doesn't explicitly mention comparing maximum outcomes or considering probability differences as negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60

This assessment indicates a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with significant uncertainty. The individual's focus on avoiding a guaranteed loss and the appeal of a potentially better outcome aligns somewhat with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the individual's deliberation process, as described, includes factors (personal financial situation, risk appetite) not directly addressed by the decision reason, and does not explicitly mention comparing the lotteries based on their maximum outcomes when probability differences are considered negligible."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the probabilities and maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The relevant information for this reason includes the maximum outcomes of each lottery (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes. However, the decision reason specifies that differences in probabilities are considered negligible, implying the focus is on the maximum outcomes when probabilities are deemed similar or not significantly different.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the probability of winning something in each lottery and the amount of the potential winnings. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the higher probability of winning something, even though the potential winnings in Lottery B are lower than in Lottery A. The report suggests the individual prioritized the likelihood of receiving any positive outcome over the maximum potential gain.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and the consideration of negligible probability differences) with what the individual considered (probabilities of winning and amounts). The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probabilities are not significantly different, but the individual's justification emphasizes the higher probability of winning any amount in Lottery B, not specifically the maximum outcome of each lottery. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of any win, regardless of the maximum outcome). Therefore, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not match the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In the given lotteries, A and B, the maximum outcomes are -6000 Euros for Lottery A and -4000 Euros for Lottery B. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, and given that both lotteries have outcomes with 25% probability, we can derive that the relevant information for this reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (-6000 Euros for A and -4000 Euros for B). However, the reason might not directly apply because it seems to be tailored for situations where one outcome is more favorable (positive), but in this case, both maximum outcomes are negative.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being uncertain and notes the high value (in terms of loss) of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, also acknowledging that losses in general make decisions harder for them. They further mention that Lottery B has a higher probability of resulting in a loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be deterred by the high potential loss in Lottery A and recognizes the higher likelihood of any loss in Lottery B. However, the justification is not explicitly clear in terms of which lottery they prefer based on these considerations.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considers the high value of the loss in Lottery A and the higher probability of any loss in Lottery B, which aligns partially with considering outcomes but does not directly reflect comparing maximum outcomes due to negligible probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are similar. The individual's justification, however, seems more influenced by the aversion to high losses and the recognition of higher loss probabilities in B, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes based on their favorability.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, especially since the reason is described in terms of preferring more favorable outcomes, which typically implies positive outcomes, and the decision problem involves negative outcomes (losses).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their deliberation process seems more influenced by loss aversion and probability of loss rather than a straightforward comparison of maximum outcomes due to negligible probability differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (5000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (5 Euros). However, the probability of achieving this outcome in Lottery B is very low (0.1%). The decision reason's applicability hinges on whether the individual considers the probability differences negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of choosing the riskier option (Lottery B) and the small probability of winning the large prize in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the probability of the large win in Lottery B was too small to be enticing, despite the potential for a greater reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences. The individual considered the potential outcomes and the small probability of the large win in Lottery B but did not explicitly state that they considered the differences in probabilities as negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the unattractiveness of the low probability of the large win, which suggests that the probability was not considered negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the small probability of the large win in Lottery B and their decision based on this factor suggest that they did not consider the probability differences negligible, as required by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros (which is more favorable than -5 Euros in Lottery A), and for Lottery A, it's -5 Euros. The difference in probabilities between the two lotteries is significant for the -5000 Euros outcome in Lottery B but negligible for the context of comparing the maximum outcomes since the focus is on the best possible outcome each lottery can offer. Thus, the decision reason can be applied by considering the maximum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the extremely low probability of loss in Lottery B and compares it to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the extremely low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certainty of a small loss in Lottery A, suggesting the small certain loss might be perceived as less significant or ""irrelevant"" in comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, which aligns with the individual considering the outcomes and their probabilities, especially focusing on the ""enormously low probability"" of loss in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification hints at downplaying the significance of the certain loss in Lottery A compared to the potential but highly improbable loss in Lottery B, which could be interpreted as leaning towards preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (Lottery B, with a maximum outcome of 0 Euros).

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process aligns with considering the more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros for Lottery B vs. -5 Euros for Lottery A) and acknowledges the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery B, which is in line with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1500 Euros. The probabilities are 50% for the positive outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the outcome in Lottery B. However, the decision reason considers negligible differences in probabilities, which might not directly apply here due to the significant difference in probabilities (50% vs. 100%). Nonetheless, the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss in Lottery A (50% chance of losing 3000 Euros) and the certainty of a smaller gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the smaller, certain gain over the risk of a significant loss, indicating a risk-averse stance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's primary concern was the risk associated with Lottery A, not directly comparing the maximum outcomes under the premise of negligible probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing Lottery A for its more favorable maximum outcome if ignoring significant probability differences, which does not align with the individual's risk-averse justification for choosing Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, rather than comparing the maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences, indicates that the decision reason was not used."

wieder klar der Reiz des definitiven Gewinns, besonders nach den vielen Verlust-Entscheidungen der letzten Durchgänge keine Lust, mit mehr Risiko zu spielen

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. 
In this case, Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 3000 Euros and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 2000 Euros. 
The probabilities of Lottery A are 50% for both outcomes, while Lottery B has a 100% probability of the single outcome. 
The decision reason can be applied to this decision problem by comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Relevant information for the decision reason: 
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 3000 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 2000 Euros
- Differences between probabilities: The difference between 100% (Lottery B) and 50% (Lottery A) is significant, but the decision reason specifies that if these differences are considered negligible, it prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions the ""Reiz des definitiven Gewinns"" (the appeal of a definitive win), implying they considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B. 
They also mention ""nach den vielen Verlust-Entscheidungen der letzten Durchgänge"" (after many loss decisions in the last rounds), suggesting past experiences influenced their decision. 
Additionally, they express ""keine Lust, mit mehr Risiko zu spielen"" (no desire to play with more risk), indicating a consideration of risk.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification seems to focus on the appeal of a guaranteed win and the desire to avoid more risk, given their past experiences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. 
However, the individual's consideration seems more focused on the certainty of the win and the avoidance of risk, rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible. 
The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the appeal of a definitive win and avoiding more risk, which does not directly align with preferring the lottery based solely on its maximum outcome when ignoring probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described, since their focus was more on risk avoidance and the certainty of a win rather than comparing maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences in probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, but with only a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the assessment of their probabilities. Since Lottery A offers a guaranteed outcome and Lottery B offers a higher maximum outcome but with a lower probability, the decision reason can indeed be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: 
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 1000 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 3000 Euros
- Probabilities: The probability difference is significant (100% for A vs. 50% for B), which may affect the application of the reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the guaranteed win in Lottery A compared to the potential loss and win in Lottery B, noting the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the guaranteed win in Lottery A was more attractive than the possibility of a higher win in Lottery B, especially considering the 50% probability of winning in B and the potential for a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the higher but probabilistic win of Lottery B, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes. However, the individual also heavily weighed the probability of winning in Lottery B, which introduces a consideration (probability) that the decision reason suggests should be deemed negligible if similar.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, indicates a strong consideration of the probability, suggesting that the probability difference was not deemed negligible by the individual.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report shows some alignment with the decision reason in terms of considering the maximum outcomes, but the significant emphasis on the probability of winning in Lottery B and its impact on their decision suggests that the probability differences were not considered negligible. This indicates that the decision reason, as defined, was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

6000 zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen, da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner; einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences in probabilities are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a fixed outcome of 0 Euros with 100% probability, and Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability. The maximum outcome of Lottery B is more favorable (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (0 Euros). The decision reason can be applied here as it involves comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk, implying they considered the potential loss of Lottery B. They also seem to consider the concept of taking a ""Durchgang Pause"" (a round of pause), which might imply opting for a safer choice or a break from risk, in this context, possibly choosing Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the risk associated with the large sum of 6000 Euros and the idea of it being acceptable to choose a safer option (implied by ""einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung"" - taking a break seems okay).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, seems more concerned with the risk of losing a large sum, which indirectly relates to the maximum outcomes but is more about risk aversion than directly comparing maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing Lottery B because of its more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible. However, the individual's justification leans towards avoiding risk, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome, rather than directly comparing the maximum possible outcomes of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process was more influenced by risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed outcome rather than a direct comparison of the maximum possible outcomes as suggested by the decision reason.
