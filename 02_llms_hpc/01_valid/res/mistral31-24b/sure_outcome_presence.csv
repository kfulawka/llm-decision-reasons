0,"Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries:

- Lottery A has no sure outcome; all outcomes have probabilities less than 100%.
- Lottery B has a sure outcome of 2400 Euros with 100% probability.

Since we can determine the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery, we can apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery B has a sure outcome of 2400 Euros, while Lottery A does not have any sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
1,"6% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason requires identifying the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A: The outcomes are 2500 Euros with 33% probability and 0 Euros with 67% probability. There is no sure outcome.
- Lottery B: The outcomes are 2400 Euros with 34% probability and 0 Euros with 66% probability. There is no sure outcome.
Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the decision reason cannot be applied to the decision problem.

2,"000 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1:** Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
- Lottery A has two possible outcomes: 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability.
- Lottery B has one possible outcome: 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
- The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome. Lottery B has a sure outcome of 3000 Euros.
- The relevant information is the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery B.
- The decision reason can be applied as we can derive the relevant information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

**Step 2:** Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- According to the decision reason, if there is a sure outcome in a lottery, then the decision reason prefers that lottery.  Since only Lottery B has a sure outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:
Step 1:  Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. In this case, both Lottery A and Lottery B do not have a sure outcome. Each lottery has a 0 Euros outcome, which is not a sure outcome.
Since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the decision reason cannot be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:**
   - The decision reason requires identifying the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
   - Lottery A: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, and 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability. There is no sure outcome.
   - Lottery B: 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, and 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability. There is no sure outcome.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A: No sure outcome (both outcomes have probabilities other than 100%).
   - Lottery B: A sure outcome of -3000 Euros (100% probability).
   - The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason requires information about the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A has no sure outcome.
- Lottery B has no sure outcome.
- The relevant information is present in the problem. Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, this means we can not strictly apply the decision rule. Therefore, we are INDIFFERENT between the lotteries.

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.**

The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because we can determine if there is a sure outcome in each lottery. A sure outcome is an outcome that occurs with 100% probability.

Let's summarize the relevant information about the lotteries:

- Lottery A: No sure outcome (both outcomes have less than 100% probability).
- Lottery B: No sure outcome (both outcomes have less than 100% probability).

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

Since neither lottery A nor lottery B has a sure outcome, the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

500 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.**STEPS:**

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries:

- Lottery A: No sure outcome (50% chance of 1000 Euros and 50% chance of 0 Euros)
- Lottery B: Sure outcome of 500 Euros (100% chance)

Since we can determine the presence of a sure outcome in both lotteries, we can apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome. Lottery B has a sure outcome of 500 Euros, while Lottery A does not have a sure outcome.

**FINAL ANSWER:** B"
11,"00 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- Lottery A has two possible outcomes, -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, with probabilities of 50% each.
- Lottery B has one outcome, -500 Euros, with a probability of 100%.

The decision reason can be applied because the relevant information about the presence of a sure outcome can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Lottery A does not have a sure outcome, as both outcomes have probabilities less than 100%.
- Lottery B has a sure outcome, -500 Euros, with a probability of 100%.

According to the decision reason, the lottery with a sure outcome is preferred. Therefore, Lottery B is preferred.
FINAL ANSWER: B"
12,"a sure outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.**STEPS:**

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- Lottery A has outcomes of 6000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability.
- Lottery B has outcomes of 4000 Euros with a 25% probability, 2000 Euros with a 25% probability, and 0 Euros with a 50% probability.
- The decision reason is based on the presence of a sure outcome (a guaranteed amount of money).

For both lotteries, all outcomes are associated with probabilities less than 100%. In other words, neither lottery has a sure outcome.

Since the relevant information (a sure outcome) cannot be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we are indifferent between the lotteries.
