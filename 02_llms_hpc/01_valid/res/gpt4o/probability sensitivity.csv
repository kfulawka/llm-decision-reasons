probability sensitivity
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
  - The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 
  - Lottery A offers 2500 Euros with 33% probability, 2400 Euros with 66% probability, and 0 Euros with 1% probability.
  - Lottery B offers 2400 Euros with 100% probability.
  - The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of obtaining each outcome.

2. Summarize the information relevant to the decision reason:
  - Lottery A: 33% for 2500 Euros, 66% for 2400 Euros, 1% for 0 Euros.
  - Lottery B: 100% for 2400 Euros.

3. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
  - The reason prefers the lottery with higher probability of obtaining a favorable (higher or non-zero) outcome.
  - Lottery B has a 100% probability of 2400 Euros, while Lottery A has probabilities spread across three different outcomes (33%, 66%, 1%).

Considering the decision reason prefers the lottery with higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome, Lottery B is preferred because it has a 100% chance of winning 2400 Euros, compared to lower probabilistic outcomes in Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Analyze the lotteries and identify the relevant information based on the decision reason. The decision reason highlights the importance of the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome:
- Lottery A offers 2500 Euros with a 33% probability.
- Lottery B offers 2400 Euros with a 34% probability.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the problem:
- Compare the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome (winning a positive amount of money) from both lotteries.
- Lottery A's probability of obtaining 2500 Euros is 33%.
- Lottery B's probability of obtaining 2400 Euros is 34%.

Since the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome is higher in Lottery B (34%) compared to Lottery A (33%), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Determine the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome for both Lottery A and Lottery B. 
   Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with a probability of 80%, and Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%.
2. According to the decision reason, the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome is preferred.
3. Compare the probabilities: Lottery A has an 80% probability, whereas Lottery B has a 100% probability.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - The decision reason specifically considers the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome in each lottery.
   - In Lottery A, the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (4000 Euros) is 20%.
   - In Lottery B, the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (3000 Euros) is 25%.
   - The relevant information about the probabilities can be derived directly from the lotteries presented.

    - Relevant information includes the outcomes and their respective probabilities. Defined favorable outcome as the less negative loss.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
    - For Lottery A, the favorable outcome is losing 0 Euros, which has a probability of 20%.
    - For Lottery B, the favorable outcome is losing -3000 Euros, which has a probability of 100% (since -3000 Euros is less negative than -4000 Euros).
    - The probability of obtaining a favorable outcome in Lottery B (100%) is higher than the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome in Lottery A (20%).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
