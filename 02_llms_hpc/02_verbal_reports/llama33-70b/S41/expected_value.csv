STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of both lotteries.
- For Lottery A: (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros.
- For Lottery B: (2400 * 1) = 2400 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of Lottery A (2409 Euros) and Lottery B (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""das sehr geringe Verlustrisiko"" which translates to ""the very low loss risk."" This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect, specifically the low risk of losing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states ""ist dem Gewinn trotzdem nicht wert"" which translates to ""is not worth the gain despite that."" This implies the individual weighed the potential gain against the risk and made a decision based on this comparison. However, the statement does not explicitly mention the calculation or consideration of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and its worth compared to the gain). The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention the expected value, focusing more on the risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (comparing risk to potential gain). The individual's justification does not directly align with the rule of choosing based on the higher expected value, as it emphasizes the risk aspect over the direct comparison of expected monetary outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report focuses on the risk aspect and the value of the potential gain in relation to this risk, rather than explicitly considering or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, was not the primary consideration in the individual's decision-making process."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (higher probability) and compares it to ""nur 100 Euro mehr Gewinn"" (just 100 Euros more winnings), indicating they considered the probabilities and the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual implies that a higher probability is more important than a slightly higher potential gain, suggesting they valued the likelihood of winning over the magnitude of the win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason relies on expected values, which are not directly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual discusses probabilities and the difference in potential winnings, not the calculated expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between probability and potential winnings, not explicitly on which lottery has the higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of expected values to make their decision, and their justification focuses on a different aspect (probability vs. potential winnings). While it's possible they intuitively considered factors that align with the decision reason, there's no clear evidence they explicitly used the expected value calculation to prefer one lottery over the other. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but not entirely certain due to the indirect nature of the verbal report."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 Euros * 0.8) + (0 Euros * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 1) = 3000 Euros. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual, the report mentions ""kein Risiko"" which translates to ""no risk"" and ""100 Prozent Gewinn"" which translates to ""100 percent gain"". This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect and the certainty of gain.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice, the mention of ""no risk"" and ""100 percent gain"" implies the individual preferred the option that guaranteed a win without any chance of loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its 100% probability of winning 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and certainty of gain), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected monetary values but rather the risk and certainty aspects.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with no risk and 100% gain), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with calculating and comparing expected values. The individual's focus was more on the risk aspect rather than the expected monetary gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the conclusion that the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, did not involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Instead, the individual focused on the absence of risk and the certainty of gain, indicating a different decision-making criterion."

Geldsumme von 1000 ist das höhere Risiko wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 800 Euros for Lottery A and 750 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Geldsumme von 1000 ist das höhere Risiko wert,"" which translates to ""A sum of money of 1000 is worth the higher risk."" This suggests the individual considered the potential monetary gain and the risk involved but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice based on the risk being worth a certain amount of money, but the exact reasoning process or criteria for this justification are not clearly outlined in terms of expected value calculations.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (monetary gain and risk). The individual's considerations do not explicitly match the information required for the decision reason (expected values), as there's no mention of calculating or comparing the expected monetary outcomes of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (risk being worth a certain amount of money). The decision reason's rule is based on a specific, calculable criterion (expected value), whereas the individual's justification is more qualitative and does not directly reference expected values or a comparable quantitative analysis.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries to make their decision. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual considered the expected values of the lotteries as the basis for their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on expected value alone.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the importance of a ""sicherer Gewinn"" (safe win) at a high probability (""fast 90 ProzentWahrscheinlichkeit""), indicating they considered the probability of winning in their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that the certainty of winning (""sicherer Gewinn"") at a high probability is more important than the sum or difference in outcomes, suggesting their decision is influenced by the risk aspect rather than purely by the expected monetary value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning, certainty of a safe win): The individual focuses on the probability of winning and the concept of a ""safe win,"" which is not directly related to calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a safe win at a high probability over the potential sum or difference): The individual's justification does not mention or imply a comparison of expected values but rather emphasizes the importance of a high probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on the certainty and probability of winning rather than on the expected monetary value of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value to make a decision, and the individual's justification does not align with this rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is 3000 * 0.002 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is 6000 * 0.001 = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The expected values of both lotteries are equal.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""volles Risiko"" (full risk) and ""halbierten Chancen auf einen höheren Gewinn"" (halved chances of a higher win), indicating they considered the risk and the potential for a higher gain, as well as the comparative probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk and the potential for a higher gain with one lottery compared to the other, suggesting a consideration of the trade-off between risk and potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention expected values or calculations. Instead, it discusses risk and comparative chances of higher gains.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, seems to weigh the risk and potential higher reward without explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the expected values of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on risk and potential for a higher gain does not align with the decision reason's rule of choosing based on expected value.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is -3000 Euros since it has a 100% chance of occurring. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""risikoreich"" which translates to ""risk-rich"" or ""high risk,"" indicating an awareness of the risk involved in one of the options. They also mention ""nur -1000 mehr bei falscher Entscheidung,"" which translates to ""only -1000 more in case of wrong decision."" This suggests the individual is considering the potential loss difference between the two options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus on the difference in potential loss (""nur -1000 mehr"") implies they are considering the outcomes of the lotteries but does not directly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating expected values but does discuss the risk and the difference in potential losses, which is related but not the same as expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to choose the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification seems to focus more on the risk and the potential additional loss rather than directly on which lottery has a higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process. While they discuss risk and potential losses, which are related concepts, there is no clear indication that they calculated and compared the expected values of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the calculation shows that Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""geringeres prozentuales Risiko überwiegt dem potentiellen Geldverlust,"" which translates to ""the lower percentage risk outweighs the potential financial loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities (percentage risk) and the potential financial losses of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of the risk (probability of loss) and the amount of potential loss, indicating a consideration of both probability and outcome magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values based on outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and potential losses, which are components of the expected value calculation, but there's no direct mention of calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the balance between risk and potential loss, not explicitly on maximizing expected value. While related, these are not the same criteria, as the individual does not directly compare the expected monetary outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates consideration of probabilities and potential losses, which are elements of the expected value calculation. However, there is no explicit mention of calculating or comparing expected values, and the justification provided does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. Therefore, while there are some related considerations, it appears unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Riskoreich, aber gute prozentuale Verteilung,"" which translates to ""Risk-rich, but good percentage distribution."" This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect (possibly the magnitude of potential losses) and the probability distribution of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but hints at a consideration of risk and probability distribution.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected value, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems to consider risk and probability, which are components of calculating expected value but are not the same as calculating it directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would lead to indifference. The individual's justification, as far as can be discerned, does not clearly align with preferring based on expected value but rather considers risk and probability distribution in a more qualitative manner.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the expected values of the lotteries or a preference based on which lottery has the higher expected value.

To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""0.1 Prozent weniger Risko"" (0.1 percent less risk), which suggests they are considering the probabilities of the outcomes. However, the statement seems to be incomplete or misinterpreted, as the actual comparison should involve the probabilities of losing (or winning) in both lotteries and how that affects their decision. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that the ""Summe bei B"" (the sum or amount at stake in B) is ""weniger nicht wert"" (less worth) due to ""0.1 Prozent weniger Risko"" (0.1 percent less risk), which seems to imply a comparison of the risk (or probability of loss) rather than the expected value directly. The statement is somewhat ambiguous but suggests a focus on risk rather than expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and risk). The individual's consideration does not directly align with the calculation of expected values, as they discuss risk rather than the monetary outcomes multiplied by their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (comparing risk). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a comparison of expected values between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 Euros * 100%) = 500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sicherer Gewinn ist besser als das Verlustrisiko,"" which translates to ""a certain gain is better than the risk of loss."" This suggests the individual considered the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize avoiding loss or preferring a certain gain over a gamble that includes a risk of loss, even if the expected values are the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss, not directly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference for the certain gain (Lottery B) over the gamble (Lottery A), not based on expected value but on risk aversion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain over a gamble, which does not align with the decision reason that solely considers the expected value of the lotteries. Since the individual's justification for the choice does not match the rule of the decision reason, and the information considered by the individual (certainty of gain vs. risk of loss) does not directly relate to the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values), it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. 
For Lottery A: (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros.
For Lottery B: (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Euros.
The expected values of both lotteries are equal. This information is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""gleiches Risiko für 0"" which translates to ""same risk for 0"" and ""sichere Variante"" which translates to ""safe variant"". This suggests the individual considered the risk of getting 0 Euros and the presence of a safer option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk aspect and the idea of a safer option, but does not explicitly mention expected values or a comparison of monetary outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, which were calculated as equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses risk and safety, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the expected values are equal, it would be indifferent. The individual’s justification, focusing on risk and safety, does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule of comparing expected values.

First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""weniger Risiko durch höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit bei 0"", which translates to ""less risk through a higher probability of 0"". This implies the individual considered the risk aspect, specifically focusing on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on minimizing risk by choosing the option with a higher probability of the 0 Euro outcome, which is perceived as less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (risk, specifically the probability of the 0 Euro outcome): The individual's focus is on risk and the probability of the 0 Euro outcome, not directly on the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (minimizing risk by focusing on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome): The decision reason and the individual's justification are based on different criteria; the decision reason is about maximizing expected value, while the individual's justification is about minimizing risk based on the probability of a specific outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the decision reason based on expected values to make the decision. Instead, the decision seems to be influenced by a risk perception related to the probability of avoiding a loss (0 Euro outcome).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5 Euros * 100%) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""bei dem Unterschied kann man Risiko nehmen,"" which translates to ""with this difference, one can take a risk."" This suggests the individual is considering the difference between the two options and the concept of risk. However, the specific information considered (e.g., probabilities, outcomes) is not explicitly mentioned.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to imply a willingness to take a risk based on the difference between the lotteries, but it does not clearly outline the criteria used for this decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The report focuses more on the concept of risk and difference, not directly on expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, hints at a consideration of risk, which is not directly related to the expected value rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason based on expected values to make the decision. The focus on risk and difference in the report does not align with the decision reason's criteria of comparing expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5. For Lottery B, the expected value is EV_B = (-5 * 1) = -5. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being convinced by a ""99% chance of no loss,"" which implies they considered the high probability of not losing any money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement suggests that the high probability of not incurring a loss was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which were not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focused on the probability of not losing money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. In this case, both lotteries have the same expected value (-5), so the decision reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of no loss, not the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was influenced by the high probability of not losing money, rather than the expected value of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value to make a decision, and this aspect is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report, it suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sicherer Gewinn,"" which translates to ""safe gain"" or ""certain win."" This indicates the individual considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report implies the individual preferred a certain outcome over a risky one, without explicitly mentioning expected values or calculations.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, while the individual's report focuses on the certainty of the gain. These are related but distinct; certainty of gain directly relates to the risk aspect rather than the calculated expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual's justification, based on seeking a ""safe gain,"" also leads to the selection of Lottery A, but through a different rationale (avoiding risk rather than comparing expected values).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on a ""safe gain"" aligns with choosing Lottery A, which has the higher expected value according to the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply a comparison of expected values between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while the outcome of the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the process described does not clearly indicate the use of expected values as the basis for the decision. This suggests that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value. To apply this reason, we calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2000 Euros * 1) = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery B and 2000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""sichere Variante für Geldgewinn,"" which translates to ""safe option for money gain"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the aspect of safety or certainty in gaining money. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies the individual preferred the safe option, which aligns with preferring a certain gain over a risky option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (safety or certainty of gaining money). While the decision reason focuses on expected values, the individual seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome. However, the concept of safety can indirectly relate to the preference for a lottery with a positive expected value, especially when one option (Lottery A) offers a guaranteed positive outcome. Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preference for the safe option). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention expected values but does imply a preference for a certain gain, which aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (since Lottery A has a higher expected value and is the safe option).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates that while there is some alignment between the decision reason and the individual's justification, the verbal report does not directly reference expected values. The individual's focus on safety and certainty indirectly supports the choice that would be made based on expected values, but it does not explicitly demonstrate the use of expected values in the decision-making process. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, suggesting a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with some uncertainty due to the indirect nature of the evidence."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = 1000 * 1 = 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sicherer Gewinn ohne Risiko,"" which translates to ""safe gain without risk."" This implies the individual considered the aspect of risk or certainty in the decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report suggests the individual's focus was on avoiding risk and achieving a certain gain, which aligns with preferring a lottery that offers a guaranteed outcome over one with uncertain outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, it emphasizes the desire for a ""safe gain without risk.""
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, focusing on a ""safe gain without risk,"" also leads to the selection of Lottery B, as it is the only option offering a guaranteed gain.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. However, the outcome of both the decision reason and the individual's justification leads to the selection of Lottery B. The verbal report does not provide a clear indication that the individual calculated or considered the expected values of the lotteries but does show a preference for the certain outcome, which coincidentally aligns with the lottery having the higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and the decision reason's outcome coincide, the verbal report does not demonstrate that the individual used the specific decision reason of comparing expected values to make the decision. The emphasis on avoiding risk and seeking a certain gain suggests a different rationale for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 Euros (0 * 1). For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the monetary outcomes and their respective probabilities. The relevant information summarized is that both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""zu großes Risiko bei Lotterie B,"" which translates to ""too much risk in Lottery B."" This indicates the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about the risk of Lottery B, implying that the risk was a significant factor in the decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was about the risk of Lottery B, not explicitly about the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on risk, not expected value, suggesting a different basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report focuses on the risk of Lottery B as the reason for their choice, which does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. Since the decision reason is based on expected values and the individual's justification is based on risk, it is clear that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
