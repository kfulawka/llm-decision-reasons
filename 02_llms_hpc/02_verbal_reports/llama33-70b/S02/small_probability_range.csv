STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing (0 Euros) in Lottery B and the potential gain of 100 Euros more than the guaranteed amount in Lottery A, noting that the probability of losing is very low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the possibility of losing (0 Euros) is very unlikely, and the potential extra gain is not entirely improbable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the low probability of losing and the potential for extra gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing the ranges of probabilities but rather focuses on the low risk of loss and the potential for additional gain in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's choice is justified by the low risk of loss and the potential for extra gain, not by comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (32% for A and 34% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sizes of the lotteries' outcomes (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1 percentage point).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risky option) because the difference in probabilities was not large.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, while the individual considered the difference in outcomes and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, not within them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 32% difference. The individual, however, justified their choice based on the riskiness of the option and the small difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, not the difference within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification and the factors they considered do not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of security and the risk associated with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially given the high sums involved. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on a desire for security and not wanting to gamble with the risk of not winning, especially with high sums at stake.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, while the individual's considerations were more about the risk and security associated with the probabilities, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its certainty, but the justification is based on a desire for security and avoiding risk rather than explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus was on security and risk aversion. Therefore, while the outcome matches, the reasoning process described does not directly align with the decision reason provided."
4,"B angelockt, da Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied von 5% nicht so groß erscheint

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as 75% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 25%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicit, as 80% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 20%. The difference is 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the potential higher gain in Lottery B and the probability difference between the two lotteries, mentioning that a 5% difference does not seem large.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the attractiveness of the higher potential gain in Lottery B and the perceived small difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery) is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the basis for the decision. The individual mentions a ""Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied von 5%"" (probability difference of 5%), which might be related to the probabilities of winning (25% vs 20%), but does not directly refer to the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as stated in the decision reason.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice does not directly align with the rule of the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual calculated or considered these specific differences (25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B) as the basis for the decision.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (6000 Euros, but since the outcome is not relevant for this calculation, we consider the lower probability which is actually for the 0 Euros outcome, thus 55%) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual was attracted to the 90% chance in Lottery A and found the less than 50% chance in Lottery B unappealing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of winning was very enticing, and the lower probability of winning in Lottery B, specifically being under 50%, was off-putting, despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was 80% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the attractiveness of the 90% chance in Lottery A and the unattractiveness of the less than 50% chance in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 10% difference. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the appeal of the high probability in Lottery A and the deterrence of the low probability in Lottery B, without explicitly referencing the difference in probability ranges as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, they were swayed by the absolute probabilities of winning in each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, giving a difference of 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 99.6% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of winning is very low (""verschwindend gering""), which suggests they considered the low probabilities of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual feels it's relatively indifferent because of the low probabilities and decides to go for the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn""), implying they focused on the potential gain due to the indifference caused by low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences in probability ranges, but the individual's report focuses on the low probabilities and the potential for higher gain, not explicitly on the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.6% difference vs. 99.8% for Lottery B). However, the individual's justification is based on the indifference due to low probabilities and choosing the higher potential gain, not on comparing the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery or used this criterion to make their decision. Instead, their focus was on the low probabilities of winning and the potential for a higher gain, which does not align with the decision reason provided."
7,"lust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 0% (100% - 100%)
- Lottery B: Difference = 60% (80% - 20%)
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the definitive loss (in Lottery A) and the possibility of no loss (20% chance in Lottery B) along with the potential loss difference between the two lotteries (1000€ more loss in Lottery B if the loss occurs).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the attractiveness of avoiding a definitive loss against the potential greater loss in Lottery B, considering the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B not worth the additional 1000€ potential loss compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities (0% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B), while the individual considers the attractiveness of outcomes and the trade-off between the certainty of loss and the potential for a larger loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery A with a difference of 0%), but the individual's justification is based on the perceived value of avoiding a definitive loss versus the risk of a larger loss, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the individual's focus is on the outcomes and the perceived value of risk, suggesting that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the outcome 0 Euros has a probability of 75%) and the maximum probability is 25% (for the outcome -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the outcome 0 Euros has a probability of 80%) and the maximum probability is 20% (for the outcome -4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 5% difference (which likely refers to the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries for their respective negative outcomes, 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B) and the magnitude of the potential losses (4000 Euros being ""erschreckend viel"" or very frightening).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the lottery with the smaller loss sum (Lottery A, with a loss of 3000 Euros), implying that the magnitude of the loss was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the difference in probabilities of the negative outcomes and the magnitude of the losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (20% difference). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the smaller loss sum and the impact of the 5% difference in probabilities, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, they focused on the difference in the probabilities of the negative outcomes and the magnitude of the potential losses. This suggests that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make the decision."
9,"unter 50%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 10% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the initial results, felt great uncertainty because Lottery B, although offering only half the loss of Lottery A, had a high probability of that loss. The individual considered the probability of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after lengthy hesitation because the probability (of losing, implied) was at least under 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (uncertainty, probability of loss, and the comparative losses), it seems the individual focused more on the comparative outcomes and their probabilities rather than the specific difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the probability being under 50% and comparative losses), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with calculating and comparing the differences in probability ranges as the decision reason suggests.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The focus was more on the comparative probabilities of loss and the absolute probability threshold (50%) rather than the range of probabilities for each lottery."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A and notes that the difference in probabilities is ""really extremely minimal."" This suggests the individual is considering the potential loss and the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual finds the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A ""definitively more frightening"" but also acknowledges the minimal difference in probabilities. This indicates the individual's deliberation process involves weighing the potential loss against the probability differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (potential loss and minimal probability difference). The individual does mention the difference in probabilities, albeit describing it as ""minimal,"" which aligns with calculating the difference but possibly misinterprets its significance or impact.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the potential loss and the minimal probability difference). The individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the difference in probabilities but is more focused on the fear of loss. However, the mention of the ""minimal"" difference suggests some consideration of the probability aspect, even if not directly applying the rule as stated by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual seems to consider elements related to the decision reason (probability differences) but does not explicitly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities as the primary justification for their choice. The focus is more on the potential loss, with the probability difference being acknowledged but not clearly used as the decision criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (such as the difference in probabilities), they do not clearly apply the rule as the basis for their decision. The primary focus on the potential loss rather than the probability differences suggests that the decision reason was not the main factor in their choice."
11,"ätzliche Guthaben hat mich in diesem Fall nicht risikobereiter gemacht)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. To do so, we first need to derive the relevant information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, considering the actual application of the rule, since both lotteries have a single outcome with 100% probability or two outcomes with equal probabilities, the calculation seems to misinterpret the rule's intent. A more nuanced interpretation might consider the range of possible outcomes' probabilities, but given the description, both lotteries have the same ""difference"" in the probabilities of their outcomes. Thus, the decision reason, as described, would not differentiate between these lotteries based on the probability differences alone, as both have a ""difference"" of 0% when considering the probabilities provided.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers the attractiveness of receiving a certain amount of money and mentions that the potential for additional gain did not make them more risk-tolerant. The key information considered by the individual seems to be the certainty of gain in one of the lotteries. The individual's justification for their choice appears to hinge on the preference for a guaranteed outcome over a risky one, especially when the additional potential gain does not increase their willingness to take risks.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain, risk tolerance), it seems there is a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the probability differences within each lottery, which, as calculated, does not apply in a meaningful way to distinguish between these specific lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the outcome. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same ""difference"" in this context, the rule does not provide a clear preference. The individual's justification, on the other hand, is about preferring certainty over potential higher gain due to risk aversion, which does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, based on these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of getting 0 Euros, implying a 0% chance of getting -1000 Euros in that specific outcome) and the maximum probability is 50%. However, correctly interpreting the decision reason in the context of the provided lotteries, we should consider the probabilities associated with the outcomes. For Lottery B, both outcomes have the same probability (50%), so the difference in probabilities for outcomes in Lottery B is 0%. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (-500 Euros with 100% probability), meaning the difference in probabilities is also 0% since there's no variation. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived and summarized as follows: Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery A also has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance to their decisions and the influence of additional funds, possibly leading them to choose the riskier option (Variante B). They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the potential for a less negative outcome in Lottery B (0 Euros with 50% probability) compared to the guaranteed loss in Lottery A. They express a preference for avoiding a certain loss, which might suggest risk-seeking behavior in this context.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery's outcomes. However, the individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention comparing probability differences between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a 0% difference in outcome probabilities. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the attractiveness of avoiding a certain loss and the influence of potential additional funds, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. The justification provided by the individual for their choice does not align with the rule specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's a 75% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is also 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes, with the 0 Euros outcome having a 50% probability, which is not the minimum but is higher than the minimum probability of winning any amount). However, the actual minimum probability for any winning outcome in B is 25%, and the maximum is 50% for the 0 Euros outcome, but since we are considering the probability of winning, the relevant comparison is between the probabilities of winning outcomes. Thus, the correct interpretation for the decision reason's applicability involves understanding the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning outcomes in each lottery. For A, the difference is between 25% (winning) and 0% (not winning, but this is implicit as the remainder of the probability distribution), and for B, it's between 25% (for each winning outcome) and 50% (not directly relevant as it's for the 0 Euros outcome, but indicating a higher spread in probabilities when considering all outcomes including 0 Euros). The decision reason's relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, focusing on the probabilities associated with winning outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher probability of winning something in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning something was higher, despite the potential winnings being lower than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probabilities within each lottery, specifically focusing on the spread between the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning outcomes. The individual, however, focused on the comparative probabilities of winning something between the two lotteries, not explicitly on the spread within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which does not directly align with the individual's justification that emphasizes the higher overall probability of winning in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason involves a specific comparison of probability spreads within each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the comparative likelihood of winning any amount between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
14,"STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions difficulty with decisions involving losses, being deterred by the high value of 6000€ in Lottery A, and acknowledges that losses are more probable in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the psychological impact of potential losses and the high value associated with one of the lotteries, rather than explicitly comparing the probability differences between the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the differences in probabilities (50% for A and 25% for B), which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the difficulty with losses and the high value of one outcome, not the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual’s justification, however, does not clearly align with this rule, focusing instead on the psychological aspects of loss and the high value of an outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual does not seem to explicitly consider or apply the decision reason based on the probability differences as described. The verbal report indicates considerations that are not directly related to the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 99.8%.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small probability of the large win in Lottery B and the fact that the loss (or rather, the forgone gain) of choosing Lottery B over Lottery A (5 Euros) would not have been significant. They also implicitly considered the risk aspect of Lottery B by describing it as ""risikofreudigere"" (more risky).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for not choosing Lottery B seems to be the very low probability of winning the large prize, which did not outweigh the risk for them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery. The individual, however, discussed the probability of the large win in Lottery B and its riskiness but did not explicitly mention comparing the internal probability spreads of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual chose Lottery A but justified it based on the low probability of the large win in Lottery B and its riskiness, not explicitly on the internal probability differences between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the specific factor of probability differences within each lottery as the basis for their decision. The justification provided focuses on the risk and the low probability of the large win, rather than the internal probability spread of the lotteries. Therefore, while the outcome matches, the reasoning process described does not directly align with the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 0.9989. For Lottery A, since the outcome is fixed at -5 Euros with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 0.9989 for Lottery B and 0 for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the very low probability of loss in Lottery B and compares it with the fixed loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certain but small loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes), it appears the individual focused more on the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities itself.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (comparing the significance of potential losses and their probabilities), there is a discrepancy. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the range of probabilities as a deciding factor, but rather the perceived impact of the potential losses.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they did not explicitly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference, we can see that both lotteries have the same difference of 0%, but the context of the reason implies looking for a lottery that minimizes risk or maximizes certainty in outcomes, which can be indirectly related to the concept of probability ranges. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the idea of preferring a smaller, certain gain over a riskier option that involves a significant loss. The individual mentions ""Lieber den kleineren Gewinn"" which translates to ""prefer the smaller gain,"" indicating a consideration of the certain outcome of one lottery over the risky outcomes of the other. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice, as described, emphasizes avoiding risk, particularly the 50% loss associated with one of the lotteries, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (preference for certainty and risk aversion), it appears the individual's focus is more on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with potential losses rather than directly on the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring a certain gain and avoiding risk), while the individual does express a preference that aligns with risk aversion, the specific rule about probability differences does not directly match the justification provided in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process involves considerations of risk and certainty, which could tangentially relate to the concept of probability differences, the verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the specific decision reason regarding the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus is more on the outcomes and the risk associated with them rather than the technical aspect of probability ranges."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the appeal of a definitive win, especially after many loss decisions in previous rounds, and expresses no desire to play with more risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on avoiding risk and preferring a certain gain after experiencing losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about the difference in probability ranges, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on risk and the certainty of gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a difference of 0%. The individual's justification, however, is about avoiding risk and preferring a certain gain, which aligns more with the characteristics of Lottery B but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus on risk avoidance and preference for a certain gain does not align with the specific rule of comparing probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain in Lottery A compared to the potential loss in Lottery B, taking into account the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the certain gain in Lottery A with the uncertain, potentially higher loss in Lottery B, emphasizing the unattractiveness of the 50% chance of a significant loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the attractiveness of the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities within each lottery. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this rule does not provide a basis for preference between the two. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of the certain gain versus the uncertain loss, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention considering the range of probabilities within each lottery as a factor in the decision-making process.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well (since there's only one probability value). The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk, implying they considered the potential loss and the size of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be about avoiding risk, specifically mentioning that risking 6000 Euros is too much and implying a preference for not risking it (since taking a ""Pause"" or break seems acceptable).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the size of the potential outcomes and the risk involved.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding risk due to the large potential loss, not on comparing probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason, which considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, does not seem to have been used by the individual based on the provided verbal report. The individual's decision-making process, as described, focuses on the risk associated with the large potential loss in Lottery B, rather than on the probability differences between the lotteries."
