STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV_B = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01). This simplifies to EV_B = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is simply 2400 Euros since it offers 2400 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 2409 Euros for Lottery B and 2400 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guarantee of a win in Lottery A, the highest possible win in Lottery B being only 100 Euros more than the win in Lottery A, and mentions that the risk of possibly getting no gain in Lottery B is not worth the potential extra 100 Euros. The probabilities in Lottery B are mentioned but deemed not crucial for the decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the potential extra 100 Euros from Lottery B is not worth the risk of possibly getting no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guarantee of win, difference in potential outcomes, risk of no gain). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (risk aversion regarding the potential for no gain). The decision reason suggests a calculation-based preference, whereas the individual's justification is based on risk aversion and the perceived value of the guaranteed outcome versus the potential extra gain.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries. Instead, it focuses on the guarantee of a win and the perceived risk associated with Lottery B. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason, which specifically considers the expected values, was the primary basis for the individual's choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are EV_A = 825 Euros and EV_B = 816 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential winnings (100 Euro difference) and the difference in probabilities (1% difference) between the two lotteries. However, they stated that the difference in probabilities plays ""absolutely no role"" in their decision, indicating they primarily focused on the difference in potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A because it offers 100 Euros more to win, and they deemed the 1% difference in probabilities too small to consider.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are based on both the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual, however, focused on the difference in potential winnings and dismissed the difference in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual preferred Lottery A because of its higher potential win, not explicitly because of its expected value. However, the justification indirectly aligns with the decision reason since the higher potential win of Lottery A contributes to its higher expected value compared to Lottery B.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's justification aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher potential win, which in this case also has the higher expected value), their stated considerations do not explicitly match the decision reason's focus on expected value. The individual's dismissal of the probability difference and focus solely on the potential winnings suggest they did not directly apply the expected value calculation as their decision rule.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 1) = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 3200 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the aspect of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win), the risk of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A, and the fact that the winnings in A and B are not too far apart.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides against the 20% chance of ending up with 0 Euros and chooses the safe win, indicating that risk minimization is a key factor in their decision. The individual also mentions that the difference in winnings between A and B is not a major concern.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are 3200 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focuses on the aspect of a safe win and risk minimization, without explicitly mentioning the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the avoidance of risk and the preference for a safe win, which aligns with choosing Lottery B, despite its lower expected value.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, as their justification is centered around risk aversion rather than maximizing expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of winning (20% for Lottery A and a ""somewhat higher"" chance for Lottery B) and the potential winnings (4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B). They mention that the probabilities are too close to be decisive and focus on the winnings because the second option (0 Euros) in both lotteries is the same and not relevant for the decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the 20% chance of winning 4000 Euros over the slightly higher chance of winning 3000 Euros, focusing on the amount to be won since the probabilities are perceived as too similar to influence the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves both the probabilities and the outcomes. While the individual discusses probabilities and outcomes, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, they focus on the similarity in probabilities and the difference in potential winnings.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual, however, bases their decision on the potential winnings, given that the probabilities are perceived as too close to make a difference. This does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule of choosing based on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the potential winnings and their perception of the probabilities being too close to influence the decision suggests they did not directly apply the decision reason of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. While they consider elements relevant to calculating expected value (outcomes and probabilities), their justification does not explicitly involve comparing expected values, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which in this case is equal for both lotteries (2700 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of winning in both lotteries and the amount of the potential win. Specifically, they mention the high probability of winning in Lottery B but note it is not certain, and they mention the nearly 50/50 chance in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides against Lottery B because its win is not guaranteed, despite the high probability. They choose Lottery A because the potential win amount is decisive for them, along with the lack of 100% win certainty in Lottery B. The individual emphasizes the importance of the win amount and the absence of a guaranteed win in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected value, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses probabilities and win amounts, which are components used to calculate expected value but does not explicitly calculate or compare the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. In this case, the expected values are equal, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or choosing based on which lottery has a higher expected value. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of the win and the amount of the potential win.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus on the win amount and the certainty of winning, without explicit mention or calculation of expected values, suggests that the decision reason based on expected value was not used. Therefore, the assessment is that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 * 0.002 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 6000 * 0.001 = 6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high reward of each lottery and notes that the probability of winning is very low in both cases. They also acknowledge that the alternative outcome (0 Euros) is the same in both lotteries. However, they focus on the fact that one lottery offers twice the reward of the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the higher reward of one lottery, stating that the difference in probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) does not matter to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual focuses on the absolute reward and disregards the slight difference in probabilities, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual chooses based on the higher reward, not the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual focuses on the absolute reward and ignores the probabilities, which leads to a different decision criterion than the one based on expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (-3000 * 1) = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery B (20% chance) and the fact that Lottery A offers a certain loss. The individual also compares the potential losses between the two lotteries but focuses more on the probability of a loss rather than its magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the desire to avoid a certain loss in Lottery A and the presence of a chance to avoid any loss in Lottery B, despite the higher potential loss if it occurs.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss and the certainty of a loss in one of the options.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case (-3000 Euros is greater than -3200 Euros). However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule; the individual prefers Lottery B because of the chance to avoid a loss, not because of its expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) was not used by the individual to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention expected values and the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -800 Euros for Lottery A and -750 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual focused less on probabilities since they did not seem significantly different and instead looked at where the loss was the least.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on minimizing loss, stating that the difference in loss probabilities (20% vs. 25%) did not play a role in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts and their probabilities): The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focused on minimizing loss, which indirectly relates to the expected value concept since lower expected loss (in absolute terms) corresponds to a higher expected value in this context.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (choosing the lottery with the least loss): The individual's approach aligns with preferring the lottery that results in a higher expected value (less loss), as Lottery B's expected loss is less than Lottery A's.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on minimizing loss and their decision-making process indirectly aligns with the concept of maximizing expected value, given that both lotteries only offer losses. However, the individual does not explicitly mention expected values or their calculation, which is the core of the decision reason. Thus, while the outcome of their decision process aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B due to its lesser expected loss), the direct application of expected value calculation as the basis for the decision is not clearly stated in the verbal report."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value, which means the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of making a loss in each lottery, specifically highlighting the 90% chance of loss in Lottery B and comparing it to the approximately 50/50 chance in Lottery A. They also acknowledge the higher loss in Lottery A but focus on the probability aspect.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because they are deterred by the high probability (90%) of losing in Lottery B, even though the loss in Lottery A is higher. The thought of losing 90% of the time in Lottery B leads them to prefer Lottery A, despite its higher potential loss, due to its more even odds of losing or not.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is the same for both lotteries. However, the individual focuses on the probability of loss and the perceived risk, not directly on the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values. In contrast, the individual prefers Lottery A due to the lower perceived probability of losing, not because of the expected value. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of choosing based on the highest expected value.

To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6. For Lottery B, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, -6. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of loss in both lotteries and mentioned that the difference of 0.1 (likely referring to the difference in probabilities) did not play a role in their decision. They focused on where they would lose less.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on minimizing loss, given the low probabilities of losing in both options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of loss and the amount of potential loss): The individual did not explicitly mention considering the expected value of the lotteries but focused on the probability and amount of potential loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (minimizing loss): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since they did not consider the overall expected value but rather the direct comparison of potential losses and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery.

For Lottery B, the EV is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and the higher potential gain in Lottery B, along with its lower probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, implying a preference for certainty over the potential for a higher but uncertain gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of the gain and the comparative probabilities and outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the expected values are equal, it would suggest indifference. The individual, however, chose based on the certainty of the gain, not explicitly comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the certainty of the gain rather than a comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries, which is what the decision reason is based on. Since the expected values of both lotteries are equal, the decision reason would not provide a basis for preferring one lottery over the other, but the individual's reasoning was centered around risk aversion (preference for a certain gain over a gamble with equal expected value), not the expected value calculation itself. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined by preferring the lottery with the higher expected value, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is -500 Euros with 100% probability, so it is also -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -500 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the desire not to choose a sure loss and the willingness to take a risk to avoid giving up money that doesn't come from their own pocket, indicating they consider the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification is based on avoiding a certain loss and taking a risk for a potential better outcome, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (avoiding certain loss, taking risk), it seems the individual does not directly consider the expected values in their deliberation.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding certain loss, taking risk for potential better outcome), there is no direct alignment since the expected values of both lotteries are equal, and the individual's reasoning does not explicitly involve comparing these values.

For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is calculated as (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same expected value.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery and compared them, noting that Lottery A has a higher probability of winning than Lottery B, even though the potential win in B is higher. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A primarily based on the higher probability of winning in A and the absence of a loss risk in the third option (which seems to refer to the 2000 Euros outcome).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning): The individual focused on the probability of winning rather than the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher probability of winning and no loss risk): The individual's justification does not mention expected value but rather the probability of winning and risk considerations.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual focused on the probability of a loss in each lottery, comparing the 25% chance of loss in Lottery A to the 50% chance of any loss in Lottery B. They mention ignoring the specific amounts because they all seemed high and prioritized the lowest risk based on the probability of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the risk of loss according to the probability of experiencing a loss, not on the expected monetary value of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of loss): The individual did not consider the expected values but focused on the probabilities of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (minimizing the probability of loss): The individual's decision-making rule, as described, does not align with the decision reason's rule since they did not consider expected values but rather the probability of incurring a loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The focus on minimizing the probability of loss rather than considering the expected monetary outcomes indicates that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (the expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the potential gain in Lottery B as the decisive factor and the willingness to take the risk for a high gain, despite the low probability, over receiving a guaranteed but low amount of 5 Euros.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification is based on the preference for the potential high gain in Lottery B over the certain but low gain in Lottery A, indicating a focus on the potential upside rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (potential gain and risk), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values in their decision-making process as described.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preference for the potential high gain over a certain low gain), it seems the individual's decision was not based on comparing expected values but rather on the attractiveness of the potential high reward in Lottery B despite its low probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a decision-making process focused on the potential for a high gain and willingness to take risk, rather than a comparison of expected values, which is the basis of the decision reason in question. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (-5 * 1) = -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are -5 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery A, the certain loss in Lottery B, and the potential for no gain in Lottery A. They weigh the risk of a high loss against the certainty of a small loss.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B (the certain loss of 5 Euros) by preferring to avoid the risk of a high loss in Lottery A, even though the probability is very low, and states that no potential gain is worth the risk of a very high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (risk of high loss, certainty of small loss, potential for no gain): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. Instead, they focus on the risk aspect and the certainty of outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding the risk of a high loss): The individual's justification is based on risk aversion and the preference for a certain outcome over a risky one, rather than explicitly comparing the expected values of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus is on avoiding risk and preferring a certain outcome over a potentially risky one, without mentioning or implying a comparison of expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected value was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 1500 Euros * 1 = 1500 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, summarizing that Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the potential loss in Lottery A, considering the amount too high to risk and views the 50/50 chance of high gain or loss as too risky. They also mention that in Lottery B, they would definitely make a gain with no risk of loss.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning expected values or the comparison of expected outcomes between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss, certainty of gain): The individual does not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries but focuses on the risk aspect.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding risk and ensuring a gain): The decision reason and the individual’s justification are based on different criteria; the decision reason is about maximizing expected value, while the individual is concerned with avoiding loss and ensuring a gain.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. Instead, their choice was influenced by the desire to avoid risk and ensure a positive outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the EV is 2000 * 1 = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 0 Euros for Lottery B and 2000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B, the certainty of gaining 2000 Euros in Lottery A, and their goal of maximizing gain while avoiding loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, avoiding the risk of a significant loss present in Lottery B, even if it means accepting a potentially lower maximum gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (risk, certainty, and gain maximization), we see that while the individual does consider aspects related to the outcomes (like the risk of loss and the certainty of gain), they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk and ensuring a certain gain), it appears that the individual's decision is driven more by risk aversion and the desire for certainty rather than a direct comparison of expected values. The individual mentions their goal is ""Gewinnmaximierung"" (gain maximization), but their decision is based on avoiding a potential loss rather than explicitly choosing the option with the higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. While the individual does aim for gain maximization, their choice is primarily justified by the avoidance of risk and the preference for a certain gain, rather than an explicit comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 * 1) = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk associated with each lottery, specifically mentioning the 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of gaining 1000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritizes a low risk and values the certainty of gaining a smaller amount over the possibility of gaining a larger amount with a significant risk of loss. The individual justifies the choice of Lottery B by its guarantee of a gain without any risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (risk and certainty of outcomes): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries but focuses on the risk and certainty associated with each.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prioritizing low risk and certainty of gain): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prioritize Lottery B solely because it has a higher expected value, not because of its lower risk.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 0 Euros (0 * 1). For Lottery B, the EV is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of loss in Lottery B, mentioning the 50% chance of losing 6000 Euros, and values the safety of Lottery A, where no loss is possible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice of Lottery A by stating that the potential loss in Lottery B is too high and not worth the risk of a possible 50% gain, preferring the safety of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is the same for both lotteries. However, the individual focuses on the risk of loss and the safety of one of the options, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual, however, chooses based on risk aversion and the desire for safety, not directly on the basis of expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision is based on risk aversion and the desire to avoid potential loss, rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value to make a decision and the individual's justification does not align with this rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
