1. Evaluate if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason requires identifying the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. A sure outcome is one that has a 100% probability of occurring.
   - Lottery A: The outcomes are -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. There is no sure outcome in Lottery A.
   - Lottery B: The outcomes are -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. There is no sure outcome in Lottery B.
   - Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the decision reason does not apply strictly as per the rule.
   - However, the decision reason could be interpreted to mean ""the lottery with the highest probability of a zero loss.""

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reasonâ€™s rule.
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, neither lottery has a sure outcome, so we need to determine if there is any other criterion to apply. Let's use the highest probability of a zero loss as the criterion.
   - Lottery A: 99.9% probability of 0 Euros (no loss).
   - Lottery B: 99.8% probability of 0 Euros (no loss).
   - Lottery A has a higher probability of 0 Euros (99.9%) compared to Lottery B (99.8%).
