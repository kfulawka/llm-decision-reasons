STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability, and there's also a 2400 Euros outcome with a 66% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (2500 Euros for B and 2400 Euros for A) and the assessment of whether the probability differences are negligible. Given the significant difference in the certainty of outcomes between the two lotteries (100% for A vs. a split for B), it's essential to evaluate how the individual perceives these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes of A and B and then considered the chances. They mention the three outcomes of B and suggest that there's a fair chance to win either 2400 or 2500 Euros, downplaying the 1% chance of winning 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential to win 2400 or 2500 Euros in Lottery B, implying that the 1% chance of 0 Euros does not significantly impact their decision. They do not explicitly state their preference rule but highlight the fairness of the chance to win the higher amounts in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences. The individual considers the outcomes and chances but does not explicitly discuss the negligibility of probability differences. However, by downplaying the 1% chance of 0 Euros, they might implicitly consider the differences in probabilities as less significant.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification emphasizes the fair chance of winning higher amounts in B, which aligns with preferring the lottery with a more favorable maximum outcome (2500 Euros in B) but does not explicitly address the negligibility of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's focus on the maximum outcomes and their implicit downplaying of the low-probability outcome suggest alignment with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the explicit consideration of probability negligibility is not clearly stated in the verbal report, leading to some uncertainty about the complete alignment with the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is higher than the midpoint but not at certainty, indicating a likelihood that the decision reason was used, but with some reservations."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 33%, respectively, which can be considered negligible given the context of the decision reason. The maximum outcomes are 2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and maximum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the probabilities (33% vs. 34%) and views the 1% difference as negligible (""spielt es für mich wieder keine große Rolle bei der Entscheidung mit der 1% Differenz""). This indicates the individual is aware of and considers the probabilities but does not see them as a significant factor in the decision. Second, the individual justifies the choice of Lottery B by mentioning the higher potential gain (""höheren Gewinn"") if one wins. This suggests the individual prioritizes the maximum possible outcome when the probability difference is not deemed significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual shows alignment. The individual considers the probabilities negligible and focuses on the maximum outcome, which matches the decision reason's criteria. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification (choosing Lottery B for its higher potential gain) also shows alignment. The individual's reasoning process, as described, follows the logic of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability, while Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B) and the probabilities (80% for Lottery A's main outcome and 100% for Lottery B's outcome). The difference in probabilities is not negligible since one lottery has a 100% chance of winning, which is significantly different from an 80% chance. However, we can still derive the necessary information for the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries (how much one can win) and then looked at the probabilities. Specifically, they noted Lottery A's 80% chance of winning 4000 Euros and the 20% chance of losing, as well as Lottery B's 100% chance of winning 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of winning 3000 Euros, which they found safer than the 80% chance of winning 4000 Euros from Lottery A, considering the risk of losing 20% of the time with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the maximum outcomes and the probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically considers the differences between probabilities as negligible, which is not the case here since the individual was heavily influenced by the difference in probabilities (80% vs. 100%).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. In contrast, the individual's justification was based on the certainty of the outcome (100% chance) rather than solely on the maximum outcome, indicating that the difference in probabilities was not considered negligible by the individual.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would suggest choosing the lottery with the higher maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's choice was significantly influenced by the difference in probabilities, prioritizing the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher reward. This indicates that the individual did not use the given decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for A, 3000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (20% for A, 25% for B). Since the decision reason is about comparing maximum outcomes when probability differences are considered negligible, we must note that the probability difference here is 5% (25% - 20%), which might be considered negligible depending on the individual's perspective.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes (Gewinn) between A and B and then looked at the probabilities. They specifically mention the attractiveness of winning 3000 Euros with a 25% probability over winning 4000 Euros with a 20% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds Lottery B more attractive because of its higher probability (25%) of winning, despite the lower maximum outcome, and mentions the 100€ difference is not a factor, implying they are focusing on the probability aspect rather than the outcome difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's primary consideration seems to be the probability of winning, not the maximum outcome itself when probabilities are similar.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligibly different. The individual, however, chose based on the perceived safety of a higher probability of winning a lesser amount, not directly because of the maximum outcome being more favorable.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not align closely with the decision reason provided, which prioritizes the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's focus was more on the probability of winning rather than the maximum potential outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A, 3000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (45% for A, 90% for B). However, the decision reason specifically mentions considering the differences between the probabilities negligible, which is not the case here since there's a significant difference between 45% and 90%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the outcomes and their respective probabilities of both lotteries. The individual mentions looking at the results and chances of A and B. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the higher probability of winning with Lottery B (90% chance of winning), which they found more secure.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and probabilities, with a focus on negligible probability differences) to that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, focusing on the security of the higher probability), there's a mismatch. The individual focused on the security aspect provided by the higher probability of winning in Lottery B, not on comparing the maximum outcomes as the primary factor. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the higher probability of winning), it's clear that the individual's decision was driven by the probability of winning rather than the maximum potential outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%. The probabilities are 0.2% and 0.1%, which can be considered negligible in terms of their difference relative to the overall probability of not winning (99.8% and 99.9%, respectively). Thus, the decision reason can be applied, focusing on the maximum outcomes since the probability differences are minimal.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros) and the probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%), but mentions that the exact amounts were relatively unimportant due to the low chances of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the lower probability, it offers a higher maximum outcome (6000 Euros) if one is lucky enough to win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the outcomes and acknowledged the probability difference but seemed to prioritize the outcome amount.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are negligibly different. The individual chose the lottery with the higher maximum outcome, citing the potential for a higher win if lucky, which aligns with preferring the more favorable outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90
The individual's reasoning closely aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritized the lottery with the higher maximum outcome due to the negligible difference in probabilities and the low overall chance of winning. While the individual mentions the amounts were ""relatively unimportant,"" their choice was still based on the potential for a higher win, which is in line with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable maximum outcome. The only reason this is not a perfect match (100) is the individual's casual dismissal of the exact amounts, which might suggest they didn't strictly follow the decision reason's criteria but ultimately made a choice that aligns with it."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 20% probability), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (with 100% probability). Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, we can derive the relevant information: Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B (-3000 Euros). The probability difference is significant in this case (80% vs. 100% for the respective outcomes), but the reason mentions considering differences as negligible, which might not directly apply here. However, the key aspect is the comparison of maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 100% probability in Lottery B and the chance of getting 0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to have a chance (20%) of getting 0 Euros, essentially to avoid the certain loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B, hoping for the best outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are considered negligible. The individual also considered the best-case scenario (0 Euros in Lottery A) as a factor in their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a chance at a more favorable outcome (0 Euros), which aligns with preferring the lottery based on its maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's decision-making process, as described, aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, even though the reason's condition about negligible probability differences does not perfectly apply. The individual's focus on avoiding a certain loss and hoping for the best outcome in Lottery A suggests they were influenced by the maximum outcomes of the lotteries, similar to the decision reason. However, the certainty of the assessment is not 100% because the verbal report does not explicitly state that the individual considered the probability differences as negligible as the decision reason suggests."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and the differences between these probabilities. However, it states that these differences are considered negligible. The reason then prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. In the context of the given lotteries, A and B, both have outcomes of 0 Euros as their maximum (or less negative) outcome, but since the reason focuses on the ""more favorable maximum outcome"" and both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with different probabilities, we interpret this as looking for the least negative or the highest outcome when losses are considered. The information relevant to this reason includes the outcomes (-4000 Euros for A, -3000 Euros for B) and their respective probabilities (20% for A, 25% for B). The decision reason can be applied by comparing these outcomes and considering the probabilities as negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, noting the higher loss in Lottery A (-4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (-3000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the higher loss in Lottery A made the 25% probability of Lottery B ""keine große Rolle"" (not a big role), implying the difference in losses was more significant than the difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, aligning with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, considering probability differences as negligible. The individual's justification focuses on the difference in losses, implying a preference for the lesser loss (Lottery B), which aligns with preferring a more favorable outcome when considering the ""maximum"" outcome in the context of losses.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process seems to align with the decision reason, as they prioritize the difference in outcomes over the differences in probabilities, which are considered negligible by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum loss of -6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and Lottery B has a maximum loss of -3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The decision reason can be applied by comparing the maximum outcomes (-6000 Euros for A and -3000 Euros for B) since the reason specifically mentions considering the maximum outcome when probability differences are deemed negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of each lottery and the associated probabilities. Specifically, they looked at the maximum amount that could be lost and the chance of losing it.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring to minimize the loss, considering the high potential loss of Lottery A (-6000 Euros) as too risky, even with a lower probability (45%), and opted for Lottery B to minimize the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when the probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's primary concern was minimizing loss, indicating they were more focused on the risk aspect rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes based on the decision reason's criteria.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are deemed negligible, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing loss due to the high potential loss in Lottery A, not directly on comparing maximum outcomes for preference.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on minimizing loss and the risk associated with the higher potential loss in Lottery A, rather than comparing maximum outcomes under the premise of negligible probability differences, suggests they did not use the decision reason as described.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum loss of -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability, and Lottery B has a maximum loss of -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The difference in probabilities (0.2% - 0.1% = 0.1%) might be considered negligible depending on the individual's perspective. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A, -6000 Euros for B) and the probabilities of these outcomes (0.2% for A, 0.1% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss (maximum negative outcome) of each lottery and then compared the chances (probabilities) of losing between the two options. They noted that the chances of losing under 0.2% are very low for both, which did not significantly influence their final decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual was convinced by the lower loss of -3000 Euros in Lottery A compared to -6000 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and their probabilities, considering the probability differences negligible. The individual also focused on the maximum losses and acknowledged the low probabilities but did not explicitly state that the probability difference was negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligible. The individual preferred Lottery A because of its less severe loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros), which aligns with preferring the more favorable (less negative) maximum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process aligns closely with the decision reason, as they prioritized the maximum outcome (in this case, the lesser loss) and seemed to downplay the significance of the probability differences, although they did not explicitly state that these differences were negligible.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum (and certain) outcome is 500 Euros. The information relevant to this decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (1000 Euros for A and 500 Euros for B) and their respective probabilities (50% for A and 100% for B). Since the decision reason specifically mentions considering negligible differences in probabilities, we note that the probabilities here are not equal, but the reason's applicability hinges on the comparison of maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the gains (outcomes) first and then compared the chances between A and B. They found A attractive due to the possibility of winning 1000 Euros at 50%, but were deterred by the 50% chance of losing. They chose B to be safe, guaranteeing 500 Euros at 100%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the desire for certainty (safety) provided by Lottery B's 100% chance of winning 500 Euros, as opposed to the risk of losing with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the outcomes and the probabilities but was swayed by the certainty of B's outcome rather than comparing maximum potential gains under the premise of negligible probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probabilities are considered negligible. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of the outcome over the potential maximum gain, indicating that the probability difference was not considered negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on certainty and the explicit mention of being deterred by the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A indicate that the probability differences were not considered negligible, contrary to the decision reason's premise. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros (no loss) with 50% probability and a loss of 1000 Euros with 50% probability, while Lottery B has a fixed loss of 500 Euros. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible, and given that one of the lotteries (B) has a certain outcome, we can derive that the relevant information for this reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (0 Euros for A and -500 Euros for B, considering the context of losses). The probabilities are 50% for the better outcome in A and 100% for the worse outcome in B, but since the reason considers negligible differences in probabilities, it simplifies to comparing the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing half of their money with Lottery A (50% chance of losing 1000 Euros) and compared it with the certainty of losing 500 Euros with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because losing 500 Euros was seen as safer than the risk of losing 1000 Euros with a 50% probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the risk of losing more with A compared to the certain loss with B, which aligns with considering the outcomes but introduces a risk aversion not explicitly mentioned in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A because it offers a 50% chance of not losing any money (more favorable than the certain loss of 500 Euros in B). However, the individual chose B because they perceived the certain loss as safer, indicating a consideration of risk rather than just the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery B based on a risk aversion principle (preferring a certain smaller loss over a gamble with a potential larger loss), which is not the principle outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences between the probabilities are negligible. In this case, both lotteries have outcomes with 25% probability, which can be considered negligible in terms of difference. The maximum outcome for Lottery A is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 6000 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and gains of both lotteries, comparing them. Specifically, they found Lottery A attractive because it offered the possibility of winning something in three different scenarios with split chances, particularly the 25% chance for either 2000 or 4000 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk of earning nothing with Lottery B was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the outcomes but emphasized the attractiveness of having multiple winning scenarios in Lottery A rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B with a 6000 Euro maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the diversification of potential winnings and the perceived high risk of earning nothing with Lottery B, not directly on comparing the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the highest maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's justification emphasizes the risk of not winning anything and the attractiveness of having multiple possible winnings, rather than focusing on the maximum outcome. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are negligible. In this case, both lotteries have outcomes with 25% probability, and the remaining probabilities are different but can be considered in the context of the reason. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of each lottery: -6000 Euros for Lottery A and -4000 Euros (or -2000 Euros, but -4000 Euros is the most relevant for comparison as it's the maximum potential loss) for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the potential losses of each lottery and then considered the probabilities. Specifically, they noted the high loss potential of Lottery A (-6000 Euros) and the lower maximum loss potential of Lottery B (-4000 Euros or -2000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential loss of -6000 Euros in Lottery A, even with a 25% chance, was too high compared to the maximum losses in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the maximum losses (which can be seen as the least favorable outcomes) and the probabilities, aligning with the type of information the decision reason considers.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery B because its maximum loss (-4000 Euros) was more favorable than Lottery A's maximum loss (-6000 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's decision process, as described, closely matches the decision reason provided, focusing on the maximum outcomes (in this case, losses) and considering the probabilities as part of their deliberation. The verbal report indicates that the individual prioritized the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which directly aligns with the decision reason's preference rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (5000 Euros for A and 5 Euros for B) and the consideration of their probabilities (0.1% for A and 100% for B). However, the decision reason specifies that probability differences are considered negligible, which might not directly apply here due to the significant difference in probabilities (0.1% vs 100%). Nonetheless, we can derive that Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome but a significantly lower probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A but found the 0.1% chance too low. They also considered the guaranteed 100% chance of winning 5 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite its lower maximum outcome, it offered a guaranteed win, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the maximum outcomes and the probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the individual's focus on the guarantee of the outcome in Lottery B suggests they were heavily influenced by the probability, not just the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, chose based on the guarantee of the outcome, not solely on the maximum possible outcome, indicating they did not apply the decision reason as stated. The significant difference in probabilities led the individual to prioritize certainty over the potential for a higher maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, prioritized the certainty of the outcome over the maximum possible gain when the probabilities were significantly different, which does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason suggests ignoring significant probability differences and focusing on the maximum outcome, which is not what the individual did. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a fixed outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability, and Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of -5000 Euros and a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (-5 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B) and the assessment of whether the probability differences are negligible (0.1% vs. 100% is a significant difference, but the reason might consider the difference between the high probabilities, such as 99.9% for B and 100% for A, as negligible). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the outcomes. 
Second, the individual justifies the choice by mentioning the low loss chance (0.1%) of Lottery B and prefers relying on 0 Euros over losing 5 Euros. The individual seems to focus on the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, focusing on the low loss chance), there's a partial match. The individual does consider the outcomes but focuses more on the low probability of a significant loss rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible) to the individual’s justification (preferring Lottery B due to its low loss chance and the possibility of getting 0 Euros), there's a partial alignment. The individual's justification indirectly reflects a consideration of the maximum outcomes (0 Euros being more favorable than -5 Euros), but it's framed around the probability of avoiding loss rather than directly applying the rule of preferring the more favorable maximum outcome due to negligible probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while there are elements of the decision reason present in the individual's thought process (consideration of outcomes and a preference for the more favorable one), the application of the reason as defined (focusing on negligible probability differences and directly preferring the more favorable maximum outcome) is not clearly and directly evident in the verbal report. The individual's focus on the low probability of a significant loss introduces a consideration (risk aversion or loss avoidance) that isn't explicitly part of the defined decision reason."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem as it considers the probabilities and the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros for Lottery B and 1500 Euros for Lottery A) and their respective probabilities (50% chance of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B and a 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros in Lottery A). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are considered negligible.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the risk of losing in Lottery B (50% chance of losing 3000 Euros) and compared it with the guaranteed win in Lottery A. The individual's justification for the choice seems to prioritize avoiding risk and securing a guaranteed win, stating that the risk is too high for Lottery B and opting for the guaranteed win of Lottery A instead. However, there seems to be a contradiction in the verbal report, as the individual concludes that ""B die bessere Lotterie"" (B is the better lottery) despite explaining reasons that would logically lead to preferring Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome and lower risk.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, the decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk aversion and guaranteed wins. The individual's justification does mention the comparison between the lotteries but emphasizes risk and guarantee rather than the maximum possible win when probabilities are deemed negligible. The decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible does not clearly match the individual's reasoning process as described. The individual's conclusion about Lottery B being better contradicts the reasoning provided, suggesting confusion or a mistake in the report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, but with only a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the assessment of their probability differences. Since Lottery A has a fixed outcome and Lottery B has a split outcome with a higher maximum value but lower certainty, the decision reason can indeed be applied by considering whether the difference in probabilities (100% vs. 50%) is deemed negligible and then comparing the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery A and notes the risk of loss with Lottery B, indicating an awareness of the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk associated with Lottery B, implying that the risk (or the probability of losing) is a significant factor in their decision-making process. The statement about the risk being ""zu hoch"" (too high) suggests that the individual is risk-averse and values the certainty of a gain over the potential for a higher gain with a significant risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the outcomes and their associated probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically looks at the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, which doesn't exactly match the individual's focus on risk aversion rather than maximizing the potential gain based on the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, seems more concerned with avoiding risk than with comparing maximum potential gains under conditions of negligible probability differences. This indicates a mismatch between the decision reason’s rule and the individual’s justification, as the individual's decision seems driven more by risk aversion than by a straightforward comparison of maximum outcomes under similar probability conditions.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual considers the outcomes and their probabilities, the focus on risk aversion and the certainty of gain rather than the comparison of maximum outcomes under conditions of negligible probability differences suggests that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice. The verbal report indicates a decision-making process that prioritizes avoiding loss over maximizing potential gain based on maximum outcomes, which does not align closely with the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher maximum outcome of 3000 Euros. However, the reason also considers the probabilities, noting that differences are negligible. In this scenario, Lottery A has a 100% probability of winning 1000 Euros, while Lottery B has a 50% probability of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros. The probabilities are significantly different, but according to the reason, if the differences are considered negligible, the focus should be on the maximum outcome.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically the high risk of losing, despite the attractive potential gain. The individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by prioritizing the guarantee of a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros, indicating a focus on avoiding loss and ensuring a certain gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and the consideration of probabilities) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and guarantee of gain), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual does consider the outcomes (in terms of the risk and the guarantee) but does not explicitly compare the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the primary basis for their decision. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible, but the individual's justification focuses more on the certainty of the outcome rather than comparing maximum potential gains directly. The individual's emphasis on avoiding risk and ensuring a guaranteed win does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes when probabilities are deemed negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there is some consideration of the outcomes, the individual's primary justification (focusing on risk and guarantee) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when ignoring negligible probability differences). The individual's decision-making process seems to prioritize risk avoidance over maximizing potential gain, which does not match the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. The probabilities are 50% for both outcomes in Lottery A and 100% for the single outcome in Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (6000 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B) and the fact that the probability differences between the two lotteries are not negligible (50% vs. 100%), which already suggests a potential mismatch with the reason's condition for negligible probability differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the two outcomes of Lottery A (the possibility of winning or losing 6000 Euros) and noted the 50% chance of losing was too high. They also considered the certain outcome of Lottery B (0 Euros with 100% probability). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A was too high, and thus, the certain outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery B was safer.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's focus was on the risk of loss and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, indicating they did not solely consider the maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences were negligible, but the individual chose Lottery B because they prioritized the certainty of not losing over the potential for a higher gain, which does not align with the decision reason's rule, especially since the individual was significantly influenced by the non-negligible probability difference.
