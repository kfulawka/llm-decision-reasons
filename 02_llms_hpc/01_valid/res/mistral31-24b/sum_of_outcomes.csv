14,"calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.**

The decision reason requires the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, regardless of their probabilities. We can derive this information from the given lotteries.

Lottery A outcomes: 5000 Euros, 0 Euros
Lottery B outcomes: 5 Euros

Sum of outcomes for Lottery A = 5000 + 0 = 5000 Euros
