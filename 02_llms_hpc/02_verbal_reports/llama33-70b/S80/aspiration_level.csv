STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the difference in money between the two lotteries (""So groß ist der Geldunterschied bei den beiden Lotterien nicht""), indicating they considered the monetary outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decides to ""spiel[e] sicher"" (play it safe) and chooses the certain option, implying a preference for avoiding risk or uncertainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to this level, considering the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focuses on the monetary difference between the lotteries and the desire to play it safe, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the probabilities of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on playing it safe and not specifically on the probability of outcomes being above an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus on playing it safe and the monetary difference without reference to an aspiration level or outcome probabilities suggests that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 and 0 - 1225 = -1225; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of winning in both lotteries as relatively low, with Lottery A having a 1% lower probability. They also note that the potential gain in Lottery A is 100 Euros higher than in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual relies on their intuition, expecting not to win in either lottery but prefers the one with the higher potential gain if they were to win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the difference in potential gains and the slight difference in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which is not directly addressed in the verbal report. The individual's preference for the lottery with the higher potential gain if they were to win aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from this level. While the individual prefers the lottery with the higher potential gain, which could be seen as a superficial alignment with preferring positive outcomes, the underlying reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery B, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given Lottery A's 80% chance of a positive difference and 20% chance of a negative difference, and Lottery B's 100% chance of a positive difference, this information can be derived, and the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the money difference between the two lotteries and the risk of not getting any money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the safer option because the money difference was not very high, and they wanted to avoid the risk of getting no money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the money difference and the risk of not getting any money, which aligns with considering outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the safer option (Lottery B) to avoid the risk of getting no money, which implies a preference for a certain, though lower, gain over a riskier option with potentially higher gain. This justification does not directly mention the aspiration level or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences but does indicate a preference for avoiding negative outcomes, which could indirectly relate to the decision reason’s focus on positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a preference for avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, which is somewhat aligned with the concept of preferring positive outcomes. However, the report lacks explicit mention of an aspiration level or the specific rule regarding probabilities of positive differences, which are core components of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for positive outcomes (or avoidance of negative ones), the direct application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the individual's justification. Thus, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used but acknowledges a minimal alignment in the risk aversion aspect."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 3500 / 4 = 1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 1750 = 2250, 0 - 1750 = -1750
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 1750 = 1250, 0 - 1750 = -1750
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities are given, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. 
The individual mentions the difference in probabilities (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeiten sind zwar nur um 5% unterschiedlich"") and finds the gain in Lottery A attractive (""der Gewinn bei Lotterie A umso attraktiver"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual seems to justify the choice based on the attractiveness of the gain in Lottery A, considering the small difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention such calculations or considerations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which is not directly addressed in the individual's justification. The individual focuses on the attractiveness of the gain and the small difference in probabilities, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. However, the mention of the difference in probabilities and the attractiveness of the gain might indirectly relate to aspects of the decision reason, but it does not directly align with the specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there might be some superficial alignment with considerations of probability and outcome attractiveness, the individual's decision-making process as described does not closely follow the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 
- For Lottery A: 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250.
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250.
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 45%, and in Lottery B, it is 90%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the gain in Lottery A to be twice as high as in Lottery B but notes that the risk is also twice as high due to the lower probability of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the surety of getting half the money (in Lottery B) over taking a high risk of getting no money, implying a preference for the lower-risk option despite the lower potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discusses the relative sizes of the gains and the risks (probabilities of winning) without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual’s preference for the lower-risk option (Lottery B) due to its higher probability of winning. However, the individual’s reasoning is based on a direct comparison of the risk and reward rather than an explicit consideration of an aspiration level and its implications.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus is more on the comparative risks and rewards, suggesting that while the outcome matches, the underlying reasoning process may not fully align with the decision reason. Thus, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards not using the decision reason but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive difference for both lotteries is associated with winning, we look at the probabilities of winning for both lotteries. Lottery A has a 0.2% probability of a positive difference, and Lottery B has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference. Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A based on the higher probability of a positive difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of winning in both lotteries to be nearly 0, but notes that Lottery A has twice the probability of winning as Lottery B. However, the individual views these probabilities as so low that they are negligible. The individual decides based on the absolute, yet highly unlikely, event of winning the money.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by focusing on the highly unlikely event of winning, implying that the potential for a higher payout in this rare instance is the basis for the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the absolute probability of winning and the potential payout in the unlikely event of winning, without explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the comparison of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its higher probability of a positive difference (0.2% vs. 0.1%). However, the individual chooses Lottery B, citing the higher payout potential in the unlikely event of winning, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the absolute outcome in the rare event of winning rather than on the probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the 80% probability of losing more money in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, but also the possibility that this might not happen. Additionally, the individual notes that Lottery B results in losing money with 100% certainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the risk of losing more money in Lottery A against the certainty of losing money in Lottery B, and values the possibility of not losing money in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considers the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level. However, the individual does consider the possibility of not losing money (a positive outcome relative to losing), which aligns with considering positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A because it offers a chance (20% probability) of not losing money, a positive difference from the aspiration level. The individual's justification values this possibility, suggesting some alignment with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the calculation of differences as described by the decision reason, the individual's consideration of the possibility of not losing money and the implicit weighing of risks and possibilities shows some alignment with the decision reason's rule. However, the report does not directly state the use of the aspiration level or the specific rule about positive differences, leading to uncertainty about the extent to which the decision reason was used."
8,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + 0 - 4000 + 0) / 4 = -3000 / 4 = -750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-750) = -2250 Euros and 0 - (-750) = 750 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-750) = -3250 Euros and 0 - (-750) = 750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 750 Euros with probabilities of 75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries (1 in 4 for Lottery A and 1 in 5 for Lottery B) and the amount of money that would be lost in each case (3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B). Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that they estimated the risk to be lower with Lottery A because the amount of money lost would be less, even though the probability of losing is slightly higher with Lottery A than with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities of losing money and the amounts of money lost. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual preferred the lottery with the lower loss amount, despite its slightly higher probability of loss. Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros) is 55%, and in Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros) is 10%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possible loss in Lottery B to be very high but notes the possibility of not losing money. In Lottery A, the individual mentions the low probability but does not specify what this low probability refers to directly in the context of gains or losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the possibility of not losing money in Lottery B and the perceived low probability in Lottery A, without explicitly stating how these considerations lead to a preference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the possibility of not losing money, which could relate to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level but does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level based on the mean of all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification hints at preferring Lottery B due to the possibility of not losing money, which aligns with the concept of positive outcomes but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule regarding probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report touches upon aspects that could be related to the decision reason, such as the consideration of not losing money, which might indirectly relate to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the report lacks explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level, considering the mean of all outcomes, or directly comparing the probabilities of positive differences between the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the direction of preference (towards Lottery B), the process described does not closely follow the decision reason's specific criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750, 0 - (-2250) = 2250, -3000 - (-2250) = -750, and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, we need to calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery A, the positive difference (2250) occurs with 99.9% probability, and for Lottery B, the positive difference (2250) occurs with 99.8% probability. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of losing money in both lotteries and notes that the probability of losing money in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, but still very low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by stating that they would choose the smaller loss, implying that they prioritize minimizing potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the low probability of losing money and the magnitude of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, whereas the individual prioritizes minimizing potential losses. The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it does not mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (500 + 1000 + 0) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 0 (since 500 - 500 = 0); for Lottery B, -500 (0 - 500) and 500 (1000 - 500). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its difference is 0), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that with Lottery B, there's nothing to lose, implying consideration of the worst-case scenario. They also mention the best-case scenario of getting twice as much money, indicating they've considered the potential gains of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential upside and the fact that the worst-case scenario isn't a loss, suggesting a risk-neutral or risk-seeking attitude towards the potential gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes against it, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences. Instead, they focus on the potential outcomes of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B in this case because it has a 50% chance of a positive outcome (1000 Euros) compared to Lottery A's 0% chance of exceeding its single outcome. The individual's justification seems to align with preferring Lottery B but does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention or imply the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of probabilities of positive differences as described by the decision reason. While the individual's choice and justification might align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the process described in the verbal report does not closely match the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner described."

The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (500 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the difference between the maximum losses of Lottery A and B, noting it is not too large. They also consider the possibility of not losing anything in Lottery A, which occurs with the same probability as the loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the potential for no loss in Lottery A and compares the maximum losses between the two lotteries. They do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the possibility of no loss and compares maximum losses but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the presence of a no-loss outcome in Lottery A and the comparison of maximum losses, which indirectly relates to the concept of differences from a certain level (in this case, zero loss) but does not directly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an explicitly calculated aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual considers aspects related to the outcomes and their probabilities, they do not explicitly apply the decision reason as defined. However, the mention of the possibility of not losing anything and its probability suggests some consideration of positive outcomes (in this case, not losing being a positive aspect), which aligns somewhat with the spirit of looking for positive differences, though not directly with the aspiration level calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while there are some elements in the verbal report that could be interpreted as aligning with the decision reason (such as considering the positive aspect of not losing in Lottery A), the individual does not explicitly apply the rule of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a slight connection in the consideration of positive outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 2000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 5 = 2400 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 2400 = 1600, 2000 - 2400 = -400, and 0 - 2400 = -2400; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2400 = 3600 and 0 - 2400 = -2400. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning money in each lottery, specifically that Lottery A offers a 50% chance of winning money and Lottery B offers only a 25% chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because they would rather win less money than take the risk of winning no money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level, whereas the individual focused on the overall probability of winning any amount of money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, but the individual's justification is based on a preference for a higher probability of winning any amount of money, not specifically on the differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from this level. Instead, the individual's choice is based on a simpler comparison of the probabilities of winning any amount of money. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, calculate the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. The outcomes are -6000, 0, -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) = (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2000 Euros. 
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between each outcome and this level, considering their probabilities. For Lottery A, the differences from the aspiration level are -6000 - (-2000) = -4000 (with 25% probability) and 0 - (-2000) = 2000 (with 75% probability). For Lottery B, the differences are -4000 - (-2000) = -2000 (with 25% probability), -2000 - (-2000) = 0 (with 25% probability), and 0 - (-2000) = 2000 (with 50% probability). 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, there's a 75% chance of a positive difference (2000), and in Lottery B, there's a 50% chance of a positive difference (2000) and a 25% chance of no difference (0), which can be considered less favorable than a positive difference in this context.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes that in Lottery B, there's a 50% probability of losing money, but in both possible loss events, the amount lost is less than in Lottery A. This suggests the individual considers the magnitude of losses and possibly the probability of these losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of potential losses between the two lotteries, focusing on the magnitude and probability of these losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from this level, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of losses, probability of losing). The individual's focus is on losses and their magnitudes rather than the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification (comparing the magnitude of losses and their probabilities). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on minimizing loss rather than maximizing the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's criteria, which are based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual focuses on the magnitude and probability of losses rather than the specific rule of maximizing the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 = -1666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 = 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 = -1671.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B offers a higher outcome (5000 Euros) than the aspiration level but with a very low probability, and Lottery A's outcome is below the aspiration level, we need to evaluate how the individual considered these aspects in their decision-making process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the outcomes of both lotteries, acknowledging the certain but small gain of 5 Euros in Lottery A and the low-probability high gain of 5000 Euros in Lottery B. They also mention that the amount in Lottery A is negligible and does not make a significant difference, implying they considered the magnitude of the outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their consideration by noting that while the probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B is extremely low, this amount would have a significant impact. This suggests the individual is considering the potential impact of the outcomes rather than just their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual discusses the outcomes and their potential impact, which aligns with considering differences from a certain reference point (though not explicitly the aspiration level calculated in Step 1).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual seems to be drawn to the potential significant impact of winning 5000 Euros, despite its low probability, which could imply a preference for the possibility of a positive difference (winning a substantial amount) over the certain but small gain in Lottery A.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences, their focus on the significant impact of the 5000 Euros outcome suggests an intuitive consideration of the potential for positive differences from their current state (or a personal aspiration level), which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery offering a higher probability of such positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing money in Lottery A as very low but still present, and the potential loss as immense. In contrast, losing 5 Euros in Lottery B is considered negligible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the risk of a significant loss in Lottery A against the certain but minor loss in Lottery B, indicating a focus on the potential negative outcomes and their willingness to avoid a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the risk of significant loss and the comparability of the losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification centers around avoiding a significant loss and considering the minor loss in Lottery B as acceptable. The individual does not explicitly discuss the aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (2500) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-3500), while Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1000). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to be considering the risk associated with Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by stating that they prefer to take less risk and have a guaranteed amount of money, implying that the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B is more appealing than the risk associated with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of risk and guaranteed outcomes aligns with preferring a lottery based on the certainty of a positive outcome (in this case, 1500 Euros from Lottery B), but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B since it offers a 100% chance of a positive difference from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed amount of money suggests a preference for certainty over risk, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for a higher probability of positive outcomes but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the calculation of differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring the guaranteed, less risky option), the explicit consideration of the aspiration level and the calculation of differences from it, as specified by the decision reason, are not directly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, it is somewhat likely but not certain that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 0. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 0 = 3000 for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -3000 - 0 = -3000 for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 2000 - 0 = 2000 for the outcome of Lottery A. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report is ""Warum das Risiko eingehen? ich nehme das Geld und bin zufrieden"", which translates to ""Why take the risk? I'll take the money and be satisfied"". The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the idea of taking a risk and being satisfied with a certain amount of money. The individual's justification for the choice appears to be the preference for a certain gain over a risky option, without explicitly mentioning probabilities or the calculation of an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (risk, certain gain, satisfaction), it seems that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences. The individual's justification for the choice (preference for a certain gain) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences). However, the individual's emphasis on avoiding risk and being satisfied with a certain amount of money might indirectly relate to the idea of preferring positive differences, but this connection is not clear.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The low assessment score indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences, and the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 0. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the aspiration level (0) and the differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level. For Lottery A, the differences are 3000 and -3000. For Lottery B, the difference is 1000. Since we can derive this information from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of Lottery A, the risk of losing money with Lottery A, and the guaranteed gain of Lottery B without risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential benefits of Lottery A against its risks and compares it to the risk-free gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and differences from it, which does not directly match the individual's focus on the risk and guaranteed gain. However, the concept of risk (losing money) in Lottery A implies consideration of negative outcomes relative to a baseline, which might indirectly relate to the aspiration level concept.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level but does consider the risk-free nature of Lottery B as a positive aspect, which could imply a preference for a guaranteed positive outcome over a risky one.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual used the decision reason based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it. While there's a mention of risk and guaranteed gain, which could tangentially relate to the concept of aspiration levels and preferences for positive outcomes, the individual's justification does not clearly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but not entirely certain due to the indirect relevance of risk considerations."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 - 0 = 6000 for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -6000 - 0 = -6000 for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 0 - 0 = 0 for Lottery A. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference (since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing 6000 Euros with Lottery B and the fact that they receive no money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that they do not want to take the risk of losing 6000 Euros, implying that avoiding loss is a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the risk of loss and the certainty of not gaining or losing with Lottery A. There is a slight connection in that both involve considering outcomes, but the individual's focus is more on risk aversion rather than the specific calculation of aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would suggest preferring Lottery B due to its 50% chance of a significant gain. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding the risk of loss, not on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The individual's justification is centered around risk aversion and avoiding loss, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule for preferring one lottery over the other. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
