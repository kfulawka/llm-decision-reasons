STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) can be calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then calculated for each outcome: for Lottery B, the differences are (2500 - 1825), (2400 - 1825), and (0 - 1825), which are 675, 575, and -1825 respectively; for Lottery A, the difference is (2400 - 1825) = 575. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery B has a 33% chance of a difference of 675, a 66% chance of a difference of 575, and a 1% chance of a difference of -1825. Lottery A has a 100% chance of a difference of 575. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of Lottery A and the potential for no gain but also no loss in Lottery B, focusing on the low probability (1%) of not winning anything in Lottery B and the potential for a higher gain (100 Euros more than Lottery A) if they chose Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the low risk (1% chance of no gain) as acceptable for the potential of a higher gain (100 Euros more) and seemed to weigh this risk against the certainty of Lottery A, not explicitly considering the exact probabilities of the higher gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of gain in Lottery A, the low risk of no gain in Lottery B, and the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B without explicitly calculating or considering an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the acceptance of a low risk for a potential higher gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on the risk and potential gain without explicit reference to an aspiration level or the comparative probabilities of exceeding such a level, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 and 0 - 1225 = -1225; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference with probabilities of 33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason is the aspiration level, the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, and the probabilities of these differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible gains/losses and the percentages. They noticed the difference in gains between the two lotteries (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1%). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by considering the potential additional value of 100 Euros to be better than the 1% difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the gains and percentages but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, but the individual's justification is based on a direct comparison of the difference in potential gains and the difference in probabilities, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from this level. While the individual considered gains and probabilities, the justification provided does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or a comparison of probabilities of positive differences from such a level. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."
3,"es mit absoluter Sicherheit einen Gewinn, bei B nur mit 80% Wahrscheinlichkeit. Ich habe mir überlegt, dass ich mich sehr ärgern würde, wenn ich die 20% treffen würde, auch wenn es in Lotterie B 1000€ mehr gäbe. Deswegen wählte ich Lotterie A, den sicheren Gewinn.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision problem involves choosing between two lotteries, A and B, with different outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important for this reason. For Lottery B, the differences are (4000 - 2333.33) = 1666.67 Euros and (0 - 2333.33) = -2333.33 Euros. For Lottery A, the difference is (3000 - 2333.33) = 666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery A (100% chance of 3000 Euros) versus the uncertainty of winning with Lottery B (80% chance of 4000 Euros and 20% chance of 0 Euros). They also thought about the potential regret of not winning with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they would regret missing out on the money if they chose Lottery B and ended up with nothing, despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning, potential regret). The individual's considerations do not directly mention the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it, but they do focus on the certainty of a gain versus the risk of no gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the certain gain to avoid regret). The individual's justification aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome (Lottery A's 3000 Euros) over a risky option with a potential for a higher but less certain gain (Lottery B), which can be seen as preferring a situation with a guaranteed positive difference from a personal aspiration level (in this case, not explicitly calculated but implied through the desire for a certain gain).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision process shares some conceptual similarities with the decision reason (focusing on the certainty of a positive outcome and avoiding regret), it does not directly apply the specific rule of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual's emphasis on certainty and regret suggests an underlying preference for avoiding negative outcomes, which aligns somewhat with the spirit of the decision reason. Thus, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with significant uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 4000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 3000 - 1750 = 1250, 0 - 1750 = -1750, 4000 - 1750 = 2250, and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries (20% vs. 25%) and the difference in the potential winnings (1000 Euros). They visualized these probabilities as fractions (1/4 and 1/5) and thought about the difference in probabilities and the difference in potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the 5% difference in probabilities seemed significant, but the 1000 Euros difference in potential winnings did not seem large enough to justify the lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes above this level. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery A because of the slightly higher probability, but the reasoning provided does not explicitly mention the concept of an aspiration level or the preference for the lottery based on the probability of outcomes being above this level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on an aspiration level and the probability of outcomes exceeding it. While the individual considered probabilities and outcomes, the justification provided does not clearly indicate the use of the specific decision reason related to aspiration levels and positive differences. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely the decision reason was used, but there is a slight possibility due to the consideration of probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 90% (since the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both lotteries and compared them, noting that the probability of winning in Lottery B is higher for the amount of 3000 Euros compared to winning double that amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they thought they would regret not taking the safer chance with a higher probability of winning, indicating a focus on the probability of the positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of outcomes above this level. The individual, however, focused on the comparative probabilities of winning without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning, which aligns with preferring a safer chance but does not directly mention the concept of an aspiration level or differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations outlined in the decision reason, particularly the calculation and use of an aspiration level to determine preferences. While the individual did consider probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, the core concept of an aspiration level and its application seems absent from their deliberation. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. These differences are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level (2250 Euros) and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible gains (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) and the percentages (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose B because the possible gain of A was twice as high as B, but the percentage chance of winning B was twice as high as A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the gains and percentages, but did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual chose B because of the trade-off between the gain and the percentage chance of winning, not explicitly considering the aspiration level or the differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as they did not consider the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -2300 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-2300) = -1700 and 0 - (-2300) = 2300; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2300) = -700. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros) and Lottery B has no chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is always -3000 Euros), the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B and the possible loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery A with a high probability, but also notes the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A by preferring to take the chance of no loss (20% probability of 0 Euros) over the certain but smaller loss in Lottery B, especially since all outcomes are losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of no loss in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the differences from the aspiration level and the desire for positive differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because of the chance of no loss, which can be seen as preferring the lottery with a higher probability of a positive difference from the aspiration level (in this context, avoiding any loss is considered a positive outcome).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the possibility of avoiding any loss and the preference for this possibility over a certain but smaller loss suggests that the decision reason, which considers the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences, played a significant role in their decision-making process. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences, which prevents a complete certainty in the assessment."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + 0 - 4000 + 0)/4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 Euros and 0 - (-1750) = 1750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have a positive difference of 1750 Euros with probabilities of 75% and 80%, respectively, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries only involve losses and the 5% difference in the probability of no loss between A and B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the potentially higher loss, despite the slightly higher probability of no loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the difference in probabilities of no loss and the potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual chose Lottery B despite it having a lower probability of a positive difference (80% vs 75% for no loss, which is the positive outcome relative to the aspiration level in this context). The individual's justification seems to contradict the decision reason's rule.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -3000, 0, -6000, and 0, which is (-3000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros; for Lottery B, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

The information relevant to the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report mentions the focus on the probability of not losing anything (gar nichts zu verlieren) rather than the potential sums. The individual chose Lottery A due to the higher probability of not losing anything. 

The information considered by the individual includes the probability of not losing in each lottery. The individual’s justification for the choice is based on the probability of not losing anything, which is higher in Lottery A (90% chance of not losing, as the 0 Euro outcome has 10% probability and the negative outcome has 90% probability, but in this context, it seems the individual is focusing on avoiding loss, thus interpreting the 90% as the chance of the less negative or the ""not losing"" scenario, which might be a misunderstanding of the task).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (probability of not losing), it appears the individual did not directly consider the aspiration level or the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. The individual focused on avoiding loss, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly relate to the calculation of the aspiration level or comparing differences from it. 

The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification is based on the probability of not losing, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -2250 Euros. This is the aspiration level. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive difference is 2250 (when the outcome is 0 Euros), we need to compare the probabilities of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries. Lottery A has a 99.8% chance of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability of a positive difference (0 Euros) from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the potential to result in a loss or no change, with no possibility of gain. They also mention that for a doubled loss (comparing -6000 Euros to -3000 Euros), there's half the probability (comparing 0.1% to 0.2%). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite 0.1% not seeming much less than 0.2% at first glance, it is significantly lower, implying they considered the difference in probabilities of the losses as a critical factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, seems to focus on the comparison of loss amounts and their respective probabilities without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be the probability of getting 0 Euros. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of loss probabilities and amounts without directly referencing the concept of an aspiration level or the preference for positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the preference for the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual does consider probabilities and outcomes, their justification is more directly related to the comparative risks of loss rather than the specific mechanism of the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 1000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 500 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive), 0 - 500 = -500 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 500 - 500 = 0 (no difference)
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (but a 100% chance of no difference, which could be considered neutral), this information is relevant and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the trade-off between a certain gain (Lottery B) and a potential zero outcome (Lottery A), noting the potential gain in Lottery A was double that of Lottery B but came with a 50% chance of gaining nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose the certain gain (Lottery B) because it was a secure option, even though the potential gain from Lottery A was higher. The justification focuses on the security of the gain versus the risk of gaining nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of outcomes being above this level. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of the gain and the risk of getting nothing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring a certain gain over a risky option with a potential for a higher reward but also a significant chance of no gain. The individual does not explicitly discuss the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the specific decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The focus on security and risk in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's emphasis on aspiration levels and positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Decision reason:
The reason considers the aspiration level. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the aspiration level as per the decision reason. The aspiration level is the mean of all outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (-500 + (-1000) + 0) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery A are 0 (since -500 - (-500) = 0), for Lottery B are -500 (since -1000 - (-500) = -500) and 500 (since 0 - (-500) = 500). The reason considers the probability of positive differences, which in this case would be the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B, since that's the only outcome that provides a positive difference from the aspiration level. Given that Lottery B offers a 50% chance of this positive difference, we can apply the decision reason to this problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions their current balance (""mein Guthaben"") but notes that regardless of the amount, they prefer a 50% chance of not losing anything over a certain loss. This indicates they are considering the outcomes of the lotteries and their implications on their financial state. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for avoiding a certain loss, indicating that the uncertainty of the outcome in Lottery B is preferable to the guaranteed loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level) with that considered by the individual (the preference for avoiding certain loss and the appeal of a chance to not lose anything). While the individual does consider the avoidance of loss, there's no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification (preferring a chance to avoid loss over a certain loss). The individual's justification aligns with preferring a lottery that offers a chance of not losing (which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level), but it does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring higher probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests a preference for avoiding certain loss and appreciating the chance of no loss, which aligns somewhat with the decision reason's focus on positive outcomes relative to an aspiration level. However, the report lacks explicit mention of calculating or considering an aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it, which are central to the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the preference for avoiding loss, it's unclear if the individual used the specific decision reason as described. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a minor, indirect alignment in the preference for uncertainty over certain loss."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes (6000, 4000, 2000, 0) is (6000 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 4 = 5000 Euros. This aspiration level is crucial for determining the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level. The reason then prefers the lottery with the higher probability of outcomes above this aspiration level. 

Given the aspiration level of 5000 Euros, Lottery A has a 25% chance of being above this level (since only the 6000 Euro outcome in Lottery B and none in Lottery A exceed 5000 Euros directly, but considering the structure of the lotteries, we analyze the probability of positive differences). However, upon closer inspection, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial calculation of probabilities concerning the aspiration level, as the actual comparison should focus on the probability of outcomes being above or below the aspiration level in each lottery. For Lottery B, the 6000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level, occurring with 25% probability, and the 0 Euro outcome is below, occurring with 75% probability. For Lottery A, none of the outcomes directly exceed the aspiration level of 5000 Euros, but the analysis should consider the distribution around this level. The correct approach should involve calculating the probability of being above the aspiration level for each lottery, which in this explanation was initially misdirected. The aspiration level concept and its application to the given lotteries require a nuanced understanding of how each lottery's outcomes compare to this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences as per the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual describes a difficult decision, visualizing each lottery in terms of outcomes and probabilities. They note Lottery B offers a higher potential gain but also a higher risk of winning nothing (75% chance of 0 Euros). The individual decides the risk is worth the potential higher reward of 6000 Euros compared to the outcomes of Lottery A (4000 or 2000 Euros with a 50% chance of nothing). The individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between the potential high reward of Lottery B and the structure of Lottery A's outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did not explicitly calculate or mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the potential high reward and the comparison of risks and outcomes between the two lotteries, rather than an explicit consideration of an aspiration level or the probabilities of outcomes being above this level. The decision reason's rule, which involves preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, does not seem to be directly applied in the individual's deliberation process as described.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -4000, -2000, 0, -6000, and 0, which equals (-4000 - 2000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then considered. For Lottery A, the differences are -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. For Lottery B, the differences are -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first looked at the percentages because it was the first problem with 3 possible outcomes. Then, it became clear that both lotteries only had losses. After that, the numbers (probabilities) became less interesting, and the individual chose the lottery where they would have a higher probability of making no losses, which is Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (percentages, losses, and the probability of no losses), it appears there's a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level, whereas the individual's justification is based on the probability of avoiding losses altogether. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from such a level. Instead, the focus is on minimizing losses, which aligns more with a risk-averse approach rather than the specific decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. To calculate the aspiration level, we sum all possible outcomes and divide by the number of outcomes: (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. This is the aspiration level. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1671.67 = -1666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1671.67 = 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 = -1671.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Lottery A has 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is below the aspiration level), and Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference (when winning 5000 Euros) and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference (when winning 0 Euros). Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 5 Euros in Lottery A and the low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the impact of winning or not winning these amounts, noting that winning 5 Euros makes little difference, but winning 5000 Euros would be a significant success, though not winning it is not considered a loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the significance of the potential gains and the certainty of the outcomes, rather than directly comparing probabilities of being above or below an aspiration level. They mention the impact of the potential winnings but do not explicitly discuss an aspiration level or the concept of positive and negative differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. While the individual discusses the potential outcomes and their significance, there is no explicit mention of an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual’s justification, however, focuses more on the absolute values of the potential winnings and their personal significance rather than on probabilities of exceeding a certain threshold.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus was more on the personal significance of the winnings and the certainty of the outcomes rather than on the concept of an aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences from it.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of the potential losses (-5000 Euros vs. -5 Euros) and the probability of the significant loss in Lottery A (""die Chance auf den Verlust von 5000 super gering ist""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the certain loss of 5 Euros is perceived as minimal compared to the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even though the chance of the latter is very low. The individual also mentions potential regret if they were to choose Lottery A and then experience the significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of potential losses and the probability of a significant loss, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because of the minimal certain loss compared to the potential significant loss in Lottery A, not explicitly due to the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on an aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's justification is based on the perceived magnitude of losses and potential regret, without explicit consideration of the aspiration level or the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros
- Lottery A: 1500 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 500 = 2500, -3000 - 500 = -3500
- For Lottery A: 1500 - 500 = 1000
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, we need to proceed to understand how this applies in the context of the individual's decision-making process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions choosing the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) over the ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is essentially about preferring a sure gain over a potential loss without explicitly discussing probabilities or the aspiration level directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's consideration is more about the certainty of gain versus potential loss, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is about avoiding potential loss and choosing a safe gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 Euros and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67 Euros; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the existence of a certain gain versus a potential gain or loss and notes that the certain gain in this decision is higher than in a previous decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses the certain gain over the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not directly match the individual's focus on certain gain versus potential gain or loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with choosing a certain positive outcome (Lottery A) over a lottery with both positive and negative outcomes (Lottery B), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the certainty of the gain and avoidance of potential loss aligns with preferring a positive outcome, but the explicit calculation and consideration of an aspiration level and the probability of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason are not mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = approximately 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33; for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considers the certainty of a 1000 Euro gain in Lottery A versus the 50-50 chance of a 3000 Euro gain or loss in Lottery B. The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for the certainty of a gain over the potential for a loss, despite the potential gain being three times as high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, and the preference for the higher probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain vs. potential for loss or gain), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both involve considerations of gain and loss. However, the decision reason specifically calculates an aspiration level and compares probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of a gain versus the risk of a loss, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly reflect the calculation of an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences as per the decision reason. 

Given the partial alignment but lack of explicit mention of key components of the decision reason in the verbal report, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for the outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is 0 Euros, the positive difference for Lottery A is 6000 Euros with 50% probability, and there is no positive difference for Lottery B. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a 100% certain outcome of 0 Euros, and Lottery A has a 50-50 chance of either winning or losing 6000 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because they would rather have no change than take a 50% risk of losing 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences, but they do consider the certain outcome of Lottery B and the risky outcomes of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on a preference for avoiding a significant loss, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome over a risky one but does not directly mention the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20

The individual's decision process, as described, does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While the individual's preference for avoiding risk and choosing a certain outcome over a gamble could indirectly relate to the concept of aspiration levels, the direct application of the decision reason as described is not evident in the verbal report. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner described, but there is a slight possibility of indirect influence."
