**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason requires us to calculate the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. This means we need to list all the monetary outcomes for each lottery and sum them up.

- **Lottery A Outcomes**: 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, 0 Euros
- **Lottery B Outcomes**: 2400 Euros

The relevant information for applying the decision reason is:
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery A: \(2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900\) Euros
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery B: \(2400\) Euros

Since we can derive the sums of outcomes for both lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

According to the decision reason, we compare the sums of the outcomes:
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery A: 4900 Euros
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery B: 2400 Euros

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes. Since 4900 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 2400 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
