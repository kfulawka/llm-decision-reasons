STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros with 100% probability, so the reference value is 2400 Euros. The reason calculates the differences between the outcomes and the reference value, considering their probabilities. For Lottery B, the differences are: (2500 - 2400) = 100 Euros with 33% probability, (2400 - 2400) = 0 Euros with 66% probability, and (0 - 2400) = -2400 Euros with 1% probability. For Lottery A, the difference is (2400 - 2400) = 0 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (100*0.33 + 0*0.66 - 2400*0.01) = 33 - 24 = 9 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing in Lottery B and compared the potential gains of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they assessed the probability of winning nothing as so low that they preferred the possibility of the same or more gain as Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value. The individual considered the probability of winning nothing and the potential for the same or more gain, which touches upon the concept of comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification is based on the low probability of winning nothing and the potential for greater or equal gain, which aligns with preferring a lottery based on its potential outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention mean differences or a systematic comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20

The individual's reasoning touches upon aspects considered by the decision reason, such as the comparison of outcomes and the consideration of probabilities. However, the verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating mean differences or using a reference value as described in the decision reason. The individual's focus on the low probability of winning nothing and the desire for potentially higher gains suggests a more intuitive or heuristic approach rather than a systematic calculation of mean differences. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used as described, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating the mean difference between the outcomes and a reference value. The reference value in this case is 0 since there's no sure outcome in the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes (2500 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B) and their respective probabilities (33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B). The mean difference for each lottery is calculated as (outcome * probability) since the reference value is 0. For Lottery A, it's 2500 * 0.33, and for Lottery B, it's 2400 * 0.34.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity in probabilities between Lottery A and Lottery B and the difference in the potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher potential win because the probabilities were very similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities, while the individual focused on the similarity of probabilities and the difference in potential winnings. There's an overlap in considering outcomes and probabilities but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities, while the individual preferred the lottery with the higher potential win due to similar probabilities. The individual's justification does not explicitly match the rule of calculating mean differences but does align with preferring a higher outcome when probabilities are similar.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the probabilities and the desire for the higher potential win when those probabilities are similar, which partially aligns with the decision reason's consideration of outcomes and their probabilities. However, the report lacks explicit mention of calculating mean differences or using a reference value as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's some alignment, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was fully applied, leading to a score below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (3000 Euros) are: for Lottery A, (4000-3000) = 1000 Euros with 80% probability and (0-3000) = -3000 Euros with 20% probability; for Lottery B, since it is the reference, its difference is 0 Euros with 100% probability. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities of these differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certainty of winning with Lottery B and the potential to lose with Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. They also mention the difference in winnings between A and B, suggesting they considered the monetary outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual is attracted to the certainty of winning with B and is deterred by the possibility of losing with A. They also mention that the difference in winnings between A and B is not large enough to choose A, implying a comparison of the potential gains and losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between the outcomes and a reference value, which in this case is the sure outcome of Lottery B. The individual does consider the certainty of winning with B and the potential outcomes of A, including the possibility of losing, which aligns with the concept of comparing outcomes against a reference. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the mean difference between the outcomes and the reference value as required by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the attractiveness of the certainty of winning with B and the unattractiveness of the potential loss with A, without explicitly discussing mean differences or their probabilities. The mention of the difference in winnings not being large enough to choose A suggests some consideration of the magnitude of outcomes but does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and their probabilities.

Given these comparisons, while the individual considers aspects relevant to the decision reason (outcomes, probabilities, and a form of comparison), they do not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring based on the mean difference of outcomes from a reference value. The individual's justification is more focused on the certainty of the outcome and the perceived risk of loss rather than a calculated mean difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are some elements of the decision reason present in the individual's thought process (consideration of outcomes and probabilities), the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (comparing mean differences from a reference value) is not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems more intuitively based on risk preference rather than a calculated comparison of mean differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and calculates the mean difference between these outcomes and a reference value. The reference value is 0 since there's no sure outcome in the decision problem. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. The differences from the reference value (0 Euros) are 4000 Euros for Lottery A's positive outcome and 3000 Euros for Lottery B's positive outcome. The mean difference for Lottery A is (4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = 800 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery B is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, it would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the differences in probabilities between the two lotteries and the potential winnings, noting that the probability difference between A and B was not significant enough to outweigh the higher potential gain of A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the difference in probability between A and B was too small, considering that A offers a higher win with a similar probability to B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean difference of outcomes from a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual considered the probability of winning and the amount to be won, but did not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean difference, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A, but the justification provided does not explicitly match the decision reason’s rule of comparing mean differences. Instead, the individual focused on the similarity in probabilities and the higher potential win of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision matches the outcome of the decision reason (both prefer Lottery A), but the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the specific rule of comparing mean differences based on the decision reason. The justification provided by the individual focuses on the comparison of probabilities and potential winnings in a more intuitive manner, without explicit reference to calculating mean differences or using a reference value as described in the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome, the process described by the individual does not clearly reflect the application of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and calculates the mean difference between these outcomes and a reference value. The reference value is determined as the value of a sure outcome if available, or zero if not. In this case, since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the reference value is zero. The outcomes for Lottery A are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is (0.45 * (6000 - 0)) + (0.55 * (0 - 0)) = 2700. For Lottery B, it is (0.90 * (3000 - 0)) + (0.10 * (0 - 0)) = 2700. This calculation shows that both lotteries have the same mean difference from the reference value (zero), which is 2700 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information for the decision reason (mean differences considering probabilities) is summarized.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the potential winnings (or lack thereof) from both lotteries, acknowledging that they ""lose nothing"" in either case but focusing on the potential for a higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher potential gain, acknowledging that the probability of winning this amount is lower than in the other lottery. This suggests the individual prioritized the magnitude of the potential win over the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual, however, seems to focus on the potential for a higher gain without explicitly mentioning probabilities or a comparative calculation of expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would suggest indifference since both lotteries have the same mean difference from the reference value. The individual, however, chose based on the potential for a higher gain, not necessarily aligning with the decision reason’s rule of comparing mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects related to the outcomes of the lotteries, their justification for choosing the lottery with the higher potential gain does not align closely with the decision reason’s rule of comparing mean differences considering probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the magnitude of the potential win rather than a calculated comparison of expected outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there are no sure outcomes in the decision problem, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes (6000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, 3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B) and their probabilities (0.1% and 99.9% for Lottery A, 0.2% and 99.8% for Lottery B). The mean differences for each lottery from the reference value (0 Euros) are calculated as follows:
- For Lottery A: (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros
- For Lottery B: (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros
This information is relevant to understanding how the decision reason would evaluate the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning nothing is almost the same in both lotteries and focuses on the potential winnings, considering the higher reward of Lottery A if a win occurs.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers twice the winnings of Lottery B at a similar probability, implying that the potential for a higher gain was the decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the calculation of mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, does consider the potential winnings and their probabilities, albeit in a more qualitative manner.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the higher potential winnings at similar probabilities, which aligns with preferring a higher expected value but does not explicitly calculate or compare mean differences as the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's focus on the higher potential winnings at similar probabilities aligns with aspects of the decision reason, which considers the outcomes and their probabilities. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences as per the decision reason, nor does it directly reference a reference value or the specific probabilistic calculations inherent in the decision reason. Thus, while there is some alignment in the consideration of outcomes and probabilities, the report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was used as defined. Therefore, the assessment is uncertain."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -3000 Euros, which serves as the reference value since it's a 100% probability outcome. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A from the reference value (-3000 Euros) can be calculated as follows: ((-4000 - (-3000)) * 0.8 + (0 - (-3000)) * 0.2) = (-1000 * 0.8 + 3000 * 0.2) = (-800 + 600) = -200. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 since it is the reference point. Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its mean difference (-200) is more favorable than Lottery B's (0 difference, implying no gain or loss from the reference, but in this context, it means a sure loss which is less favorable than the potential for a better outcome in A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference in potential losses between Lottery A and Lottery B and the probability of not losing anything in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because the difference in potential losses is not large enough to outweigh the preference for the small chance of not losing anything (20% chance of 0 Euros loss in Lottery A) over the certainty of losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the mean differences from a reference value, which aligns with the individual considering the differences in losses but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, and the individual prefers Lottery A for its chance of not losing, which indirectly relates to preferring a potentially more favorable outcome (not losing) over a sure loss.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process aligns with preferring a lottery based on the consideration of potential losses and the value of avoiding a sure loss, which shares a similar spirit with the decision reason's focus on mean differences from a reference point. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using the reference value as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty, as the individual's verbal report does not directly reference the specific calculations or reference value used by the decision reason, but their justification shares a conceptual similarity with the reason's preference for more favorable outcomes based on probabilities and differences from a sure outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, comparing them to a reference value. Since there's no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries:
- Lottery A: -4000 Euros with 20% probability, 0 Euros with 80% probability.
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability.
The mean difference for Lottery A is calculated as (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros.
The mean difference for Lottery B is calculated as (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros.
Since both lotteries have negative mean differences, the reason prefers the one with the less negative mean difference, which is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the potential loss in both lotteries and the difference in probabilities (""5% Unterschied""), implying they look at the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual prefers Lottery B because they lose less, even though the probability of losing is higher, and they consider the 5% difference in risk acceptable for losing less.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considers the potential losses and the difference in probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case is Lottery B due to its less negative expected loss (-750 Euros vs. -800 Euros). The individual's justification also favors Lottery B because of losing less, despite the slightly higher probability of losing, which aligns with preferring the less negative expected outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90
This assessment is high because the individual's consideration of the potential losses and the justification for choosing Lottery B due to losing less (despite a higher probability of loss) closely aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention mean differences or reference values, but their decision-making process reflects a similar logic."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, comparing them to a reference value. Since neither lottery offers a sure outcome (100% probability of a specific gain), the reference value is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries:
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 45% probability, 0 Euros with 55% probability
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 90% probability, 0 Euros with 10% probability
The mean difference for Lottery B is calculated as (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros, and for Lottery A as (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros. This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of not losing anything in both lotteries and the amount that could be lost.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a higher probability of not losing anything, indicating a focus on avoiding loss rather than the expected value or mean difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual, however, focuses on the probability of not losing and the amount that could be lost, not explicitly mentioning mean differences or expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, while the individual prefers the lottery with a higher probability of not losing anything, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and the probability of not losing, rather than on the mean differences between the outcomes and the reference value, indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating a mean difference based on these outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value. In this case, since neither lottery offers a sure outcome (100% probability of a specific gain), the reference value is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability, and for Lottery B, the outcome is -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. Both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with probabilities of 99.8% and 99.9%, respectively. The decision reason calculates the mean difference for each lottery by considering these outcomes and probabilities. Since the reference value is 0, the differences are simply the outcomes themselves, weighted by their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential losses of each lottery, noting that the loss in Lottery A is half of the loss in Lottery B. They also mention the minimal difference in probabilities (0.01%) between the two lotteries but decide it's negligible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the potential loss is half that of Lottery B, and they are willing to overlook the slight difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities, whereas the individual focuses on the magnitude of potential losses and finds the difference in probabilities negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual prefers Lottery A because the loss is smaller, effectively considering the outcomes but not explicitly calculating mean differences as the decision reason would.

Given these comparisons, while the individual considers the outcomes (potential losses) and mentions probabilities, their approach simplifies to comparing the magnitude of potential losses and deems the probability difference insignificant. This simplification does not fully align with the decision reason’s process of calculating mean differences based on probabilities. However, the individual's focus on the relative sizes of the losses and the consideration of probabilities (albeit deeming their difference negligible) suggests some overlap with the decision reason's concerns.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, the reference value is the sure outcome of Lottery A, which is 500 Euros with 100% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are:
- For Lottery A: 500 - 500 = 0 (with 100% probability)
- For Lottery B: 1000 - 500 = 500 (with 50% probability) and 0 - 500 = -500 (with 50% probability)
The mean difference for Lottery A is 0, and for Lottery B, it is (500 * 0.5) + (-500 * 0.5) = 0.
The decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions being 100% sure of winning something with Lottery A and views the possibility of winning double or losing everything with Lottery B as too uncertain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the perceived uncertainty of the outcomes with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, which doesn't directly match the individual's focus on certainty and uncertainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the certainty of winning something over the uncertainty of potentially winning more or nothing.
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the calculations and preferences outlined in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while there might be some superficial alignment in the preference for a sure outcome, the underlying reasoning process described by the individual does not closely follow the specific rule outlined in the decision reason, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are:
- For Lottery A: (-1000 - (-500)) with 50% probability = -500 with 50% probability, and (0 - (-500)) with 50% probability = 500 with 50% probability.
- For Lottery B: Since it's the reference, its difference is 0 with 100% probability.
The mean difference for Lottery A is (-500 * 0.5 + 500 * 0.5) = 0, and for Lottery B, it's 0 (since the difference is 0 with 100% probability).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A and the fact that losing double the amount of Lottery B's loss is still somehow compensated by the possibility of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it offers a chance to lose nothing, which seems better even though the potential loss is double that of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences of outcomes from a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual focuses on the possibility of not losing and the comparative losses, which indirectly touches upon the idea of outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly calculate or mention mean differences or a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual prefers Lottery A because of the chance to lose nothing, which aligns with preferring a lottery based on its outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly follow the rule of calculating mean differences.

The individual's reasoning touches upon aspects considered by the decision reason, such as outcomes and their probabilities, but does not explicitly apply the rule of calculating mean differences from a reference value or directly state a preference based on this calculation. Therefore, while there's a vague alignment in considering probabilities and outcomes, the explicit application of the decision reason's rule is not evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there is no sure outcome in either lottery with 100% probability, the reference value is 0. The outcomes of Lottery B are 6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. The outcomes of Lottery A are 4000 Euros with 25% probability, 2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (0) are 6000, 0, 4000, 2000, and 0. These differences and their probabilities are relevant to the decision reason. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probability of winning something in Lottery A (50%) and the comparison of this probability to the probability of winning in Lottery B. The individual also considers the potential loss (or not winning) in both lotteries, particularly mentioning that the probability of losing (going out empty-handed) is too high in Lottery B. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the risk aversion aspect, particularly valuing the certainty of getting something (even if less) in Lottery A over the higher risk of getting nothing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between outcomes and the reference value, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning and losing, and the value of getting something vs. nothing), we see some overlap in the consideration of probabilities and outcomes but not a direct match in how these are evaluated (mean difference considering probabilities).
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the risk of losing and the value of a guaranteed win, even if smaller), there is a conceptual alignment in considering the trade-offs between different outcomes and their probabilities, but the verbal report does not explicitly discuss calculating or comparing mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific calculations or considerations outlined in the decision reason (mean differences and their probabilities), although there is a general concern with risk and the value of assured outcomes that indirectly relates to the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and their probabilities. Therefore, while there's some conceptual overlap, the direct application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The reason calculates the differences between the outcomes and the reference value, which are the outcomes themselves in this case, and considers their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes and their probabilities are -6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes and their probabilities are -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A is (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500. The mean difference for Lottery B is (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean difference, but the decision reason can still be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything (0 Euros) in both lotteries and compared these probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because the probability of not losing anything (0 Euros) is higher in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, despite the potential for a greater loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, while the individual focused on the probability of not losing anything.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, but the individual's justification is based on the probability of avoiding any loss, not directly on mean differences or their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the higher probability of not losing anything, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and their probabilities. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same mean difference, but the individual's choice is based on a different criterion. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 5 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The reference value, as per the decision reason, is 5 Euros (the sure outcome from Lottery B). The differences between the outcomes and the reference value for Lottery A are (5000 - 5) = 4995 Euros and (0 - 5) = -5 Euros, with their respective probabilities. For Lottery B, since it is the reference, its difference is 0 Euros with 100% probability. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. Thus, we can calculate the mean difference for Lottery A as (4995 * 0.001) + (-5 * 0.999) = 4.995 - 4.995 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it remains 0 Euros since it's the reference. This calculation shows that the decision reason can indeed be applied, but it simplifies to comparing the expected values or considering the sure gain versus the potential but highly uncertain larger gain.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the high difference between winning and not winning. They also considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice with the belief that the probability of winning in Lottery A is too low, despite the high potential gain, leading them to prefer the certainty of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences from a reference value and their probabilities. The individual considered the probability of winning and the high difference in outcomes but didn't explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values or mean differences from a reference point.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers based on mean differences from a reference, which in this case simplifies due to the presence of a sure outcome. The individual preferred the sure outcome due to the low probability of the high gain in Lottery A, which aligns with preferring a more certain, though smaller, gain over a highly uncertain larger one.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's reasoning about the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the low probability of the high gain in Lottery A aligns with considering the importance of the probability of outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason. However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences from a reference value or directly applying the rule as described by the decision reason. The focus on certainty and the comparison of outcomes implicitly suggests some alignment with the decision reason's considerations, but it does not perfectly match the explicit calculation and comparison the decision reason entails. Therefore, while there is some evidence to suggest the decision reason might have been influential, it is not a perfect match, leading to an assessment above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The reference value, based on the decision problem, is -5 Euros because it is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-5) = -4995 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 - (-5) = 5 Euros with 99.9% probability; for Lottery A, since it is the reference, the difference is 0 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (-4995 * 0.001) + (5 * 0.999) = -4.995 + 4.995 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean difference is 0 Euros since it's the reference point. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual mentions the high probability of not losing anything (nix zu verlieren) as the main reason for their choice, indicating they focused on the risk aspect and the high probability of not losing in Lottery B. They also mention that -5 Euros is so little that they could theoretically choose Lottery A as well, but they opted for the high probability of not losing. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to hinge on the probability of avoiding loss rather than calculating mean differences or explicitly comparing outcomes to a reference value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value) with that considered by the individual (high probability of not losing and the minimal loss in Lottery A), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual does not explicitly discuss calculating mean differences or comparing outcomes to a reference value as described by the decision reason. Instead, their focus is on avoiding loss, which aligns with the concept of risk aversion but does not directly reflect the calculation-based approach of the decision reason. The individual’s justification for the choice emphasizes the high probability of not losing, which indirectly relates to the probabilities of the outcomes but does not explicitly consider the mean differences as the decision reason would require.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision might seem to align with risk aversion principles, their verbal report does not explicitly demonstrate the use of mean differences or a reference value as outlined in the decision reason. The focus on avoiding loss and the high probability of not losing does not directly correspond to the calculations implied by the decision reason, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."
17,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. The outcomes of Lottery A are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated by considering the differences between its outcomes and the reference value (1500 Euros), weighted by their probabilities. For Lottery B, since it is the sure outcome, its mean difference is 0 (as it is the reference point). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason includes the calculation of mean differences for both lotteries based on their outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 1500 Euros in Lottery B and the risk of losing the same amount in Lottery A, as well as the potential to win double in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a 100% chance of winning, and although the potential to win double in Lottery A was tempting, the risk of losing was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities, a key aspect of the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or comparing them between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the risk in Lottery A, which indirectly suggests a consideration of the potential losses and gains but does not explicitly mention a comparison of mean differences or a systematic evaluation based on the decision reason’s rule.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision-making process seems to involve considerations that are somewhat aligned with the decision reason (such as focusing on the certainty of outcomes and the risk), the explicit calculation and comparison of mean differences as outlined in the decision reason are not clearly described in the verbal report. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used by the individual in the exact manner it is defined.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied because it considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. The differences between the outcomes of Lottery B (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros) and the reference value (2000 Euros) can be calculated as 1000 Euros (3000 - 2000) and -5000 Euros (-3000 - 2000), respectively. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated by considering these differences and their probabilities: (0.5 * 1000) + (0.5 * -5000) = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 since it is the reference point. Thus, the decision reason can be applied by comparing the mean differences of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the sure outcome of Lottery A and compares it with the potential outcomes of Lottery B, indicating an awareness of the differences between the lotteries' outcomes.
Second, the individual justifies the choice by stating that the difference between the potential winnings of A and B seems too small, implying that the certainty of winning in Lottery A is more appealing than the potential higher gain in Lottery B. This suggests the individual values the certainty of the outcome over the potential for higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the outcomes and the reference value, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (the sure outcome of A and the comparison of outcomes between A and B), it appears the individual considered the key aspects relevant to the decision reason, though the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or considering probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference) to the individual's justification (preferring the certainty of Lottery A due to the perceived small difference in potential winnings), there is a partial alignment. The individual's focus on the certainty and the comparison of outcomes aligns with considering differences from a reference point, but the explicit calculation of mean differences and their probabilities is not mentioned.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process considered key elements relevant to the decision reason (such as the sure outcome and comparative differences), the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (calculating and comparing mean differences based on probabilities) is not clearly stated in the verbal report. The individual's justification leans towards valuing certainty over potential higher gains, which aligns partially with the decision reason's preference for the more favorable mean difference, but without explicit mention of how probabilities influence this decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied to the given decision problem because it considers the outcomes and their probabilities of the two lotteries and a reference value. The reference value in this case is 1000 Euros, which is the sure outcome of Lottery B with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of both lotteries and their respective probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated as (3000 - 1000) * 0.5 + (-3000 - 1000) * 0.5, which simplifies to 2000 * 0.5 - 4000 * 0.5 = -1000. For Lottery B, since it is the reference point itself, its mean difference is 0 (1000 - 1000 = 0).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of Lottery A, specifically mentioning the ""50% Verlust"" (50% loss), indicating they are aware of the negative outcome and its probability in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B because the 50% chance of losing with Lottery A is deemed too high, implying that the risk of loss is a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between the lotteries' outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual, however, focuses on the risk of loss associated with Lottery A without explicitly calculating or mentioning mean differences or comparing outcomes to a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery B since it has a mean difference of 0 compared to Lottery A's -1000. The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating mean differences, essentially prefers the sure gain of Lottery B over the risk of loss in Lottery A, which aligns with preferring a more favorable (or less unfavorable) outcome but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision to choose Lottery B aligns with the outcome the decision reason would prefer (due to its focus on avoiding loss), the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences to a reference value. The individual's focus is more on the risk of loss rather than calculating and comparing mean differences, indicating that the decision reason was not directly used in the decision-making process as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's break down the analysis into the required steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 0 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated by considering the differences between its outcomes and the reference value (0 Euros), weighted by their probabilities. The difference for 6000 Euros is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros, and for -6000 Euros, it is -6000 - 0 = -6000 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery A is (0.5 * 6000) + (0.5 * -6000) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 Euros (since it's the reference value itself), so its mean difference is also 0 Euros. Therefore, both lotteries have a mean difference of 0 Euros when considering the reference value, making the decision reason applicable but resulting in indifference according to its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the risk of not winning anything with Lottery B and the 50% chance of winning with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to take a risk to potentially win money (with Lottery A) rather than choosing an option where they know they won't win anything (Lottery B).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences from a reference value, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering mean differences or a reference value. Instead, the individual focuses on the risk of not winning anything with Lottery B and the chance to win with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on mean differences, but the individual shows a preference for Lottery A due to the desire to avoid the certainty of not winning with Lottery B. This indicates the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on mean differences from a reference value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of mean differences from a reference value in their decision-making process, nor does their justification align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
