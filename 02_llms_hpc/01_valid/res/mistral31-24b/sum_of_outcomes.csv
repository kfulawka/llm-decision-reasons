12,"sum.STEPS:
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. The relevant information that can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes is the sum of the outcomes of each lottery. Sum of the outcomes for lottery A is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros and for lottery B is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. So, the sum of the outcomes is 6000 Euros for lottery A and 6000 Euros for lottery B.
Step 2: According to the decision reason, lottery A has a sum of 6000 Euros and lottery B also has a sum of 6000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum. Therefore, the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

14,"calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.**

The decision reason requires the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, regardless of their probabilities. We can derive this information from the given lotteries.

Lottery A outcomes: 5000 Euros, 0 Euros
Lottery B outcomes: 5 Euros

Sum of outcomes for Lottery A = 5000 + 0 = 5000 Euros
