0,"prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- Identify the minimum outcomes and their probabilities for each lottery:
  - Lottery A: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%.
  - Lottery B: The minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.
- Since we can clearly determine the minimum outcomes and their probabilities, the decision reason can be applied strictly.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes:
  - Lottery A: Probability of minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 1%.
  - Lottery B: Probability of minimum outcome (2400 Euros) is 100%.
- According to the decision reason, the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome is preferred.
- Lottery B has a higher probability (100%) of the minimum outcome compared to Lottery A (1%).
