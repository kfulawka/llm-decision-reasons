STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 2400 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the 1% chance of winning nothing, the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries, and the additional 100 Euro gain in Lottery A with 33% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning that the expected value of Lottery A is slightly higher, and although there's a 1% chance of winning nothing, this is compensated by the potential for an additional 100 Euro gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected values and probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on expected values and the compensation of risks, not on comparing the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as there is no mention of summing the outcomes of the lotteries and comparing them.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 2500 + 0 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 2400 + 0 = 2400 Euros. Since the sum of outcomes for Lottery A (2500 Euros) is higher than for Lottery B (2400 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the expected value of both lotteries, the similarity between the gains and probabilities of both lotteries, and the difference in possible gains. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on the similarity between the two lotteries but ultimately decided on Lottery B due to its slightly higher winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value, similarity in gains and probabilities, difference in possible gains) shows that the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes of each lottery as the decision reason does.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring Lottery B due to its slightly higher winning probability) indicates that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions, we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery and the fact that Lottery A offers a certain gain, while Lottery B offers a chance at a higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, despite Lottery B having a slightly higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered expected values and the certainty of the gain. This indicates a mismatch in the information considered.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on its certain gain, not the sum of its outcomes. This indicates a mismatch in the decision-making rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities. The individual's consideration of expected values and the certainty of the gain, rather than the sum of outcomes, suggests that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is 4000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B being slightly higher, the probability of winning in Lottery A, the higher potential gain in Lottery B, and the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B due to its higher potential gain despite acknowledging that the probability of winning is slightly higher in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual. Instead, the individual discusses expected values and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which aligns with the individual's justification of choosing Lottery B due to its ""deutlich höheren"" (significantly higher) potential gain. However, the individual's reasoning seems more aligned with considering the expected value or the balance between potential gain and probability rather than solely the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined (sum of all outcomes independent of probabilities). While the individual chose Lottery B due to its higher potential gain, the reasoning provided in the verbal report suggests a more nuanced consideration that includes expected value and probability, rather than solely the sum of outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a slight alignment in the preference for the higher outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries (noting they are the same) and the probability of winning in each lottery, focusing on the higher chance of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a significantly higher chance of winning, even though the win is half the amount of Lottery A's potential win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes for each lottery (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), but the individual's consideration was based on expected values and probabilities of winning, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher sum of outcomes (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros), but the individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning, not the sum of its outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it's clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason provided, as the individual focused on probabilities and expected values rather than the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated and compared, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the low probability of winning in both, and that Lottery A offers a chance at a twice-as-high win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the low probability of winning in both lotteries, Lottery A offers a higher potential win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration. Instead, the individual talks about expected values and the relative size of potential wins.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (Lottery A in this case), and the individual also chose Lottery A, but based on the potential for a higher win, not explicitly the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the sum of all outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the relative potential wins and the expected values, rather than the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery, the fact that Lottery B offers a certain loss, and that Lottery A has a probability of not losing anything. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having losses in the same order of magnitude, Lottery A offers a good chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value, certain loss, probability of no loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the sum of outcomes as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the chance of not losing and the magnitude of losses), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because -3000 is greater than -4000, but the individual's reasoning is based on different criteria.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. Since the sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery, the probability of loss, and the magnitude of the loss in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has a slightly higher expected value, a lower loss amount, and only a marginally higher probability of loss compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered expected values and probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on expected value and the comparative analysis of loss magnitudes and probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, as they considered different factors (expected value, probability of loss, and magnitude of loss) in their decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
9,"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, and both sums are negative, it would prefer the lottery with the less negative sum, which is Lottery A.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same, and discusses the high loss probability of both, but notes it's higher for Lottery A. The individual also compares the potential loss and its probability between the two lotteries, focusing on the fact that while a loss in Lottery B is less probable, its potential loss is twice as high as in Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the difference in probabilities outweighing the difference in potential losses. The described deliberation process focuses on probabilities and expected outcomes rather than the sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value, loss probabilities, and potential losses), there's a clear mismatch. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (focusing on probabilities and expected outcomes). The individual's reasoning is more aligned with expected utility theory or a risk assessment rather than the simplistic outcome sum comparison.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery A since -3000 is greater than -6000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, acknowledges the potential loss in Lottery B is double that of Lottery A, and recognizes the probabilities of losses in both are very low.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential loss is half that of Lottery B, despite both losses having small probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value, potential losses, and their probabilities), it appears the individual did not directly consider the sum of all outcomes as per the decision reason. Instead, the focus was on the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the lesser loss due to its smaller magnitude), it's clear the individual's decision-making process was influenced by the size of the potential losses rather than the sum of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses solely on the sum of outcomes regardless of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 1000 + 0 = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same, and the fact that Lottery B offers a secure gain of 500 Euros. They also considered the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A and compared the magnitudes of potential gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure gain, and they were deterred by the risk of winning nothing with Lottery A, despite the potential gains being of similar magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the decision-making process. Instead, the individual discusses expected values and the security of the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on its secure gain and the risk associated with Lottery A, not based on the sum of outcomes.

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability, so the sum is -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, each with 50% probability, but since the reason considers the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, we simply add -1000 + 0 = -1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: -500 Euros for Lottery A and -1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, noting they are equal. They also considered the nature of the losses and the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a 50% chance of not losing anything, and they perceived the losses to be in a similar order of magnitude, but the possibility of no loss swayed their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-500 Euros for A and -1000 Euros for B), while the individual considered expected values and the possibility of not losing anything, not the sum of outcomes directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum (-500 > -1000), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the chance of not losing anything, not the sum of outcomes.

For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same total outcome sum of 6000 Euros. This means the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, recognizes the higher potential gain in Lottery A, and acknowledges the double chance of a similar or lower gain in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a double chance of winning, with potential winnings in the same order of magnitude, despite acknowledging the same expected value for both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the total sum of outcomes, which is the same for both lotteries. In contrast, the individual considers the expected value, the potential for high gains, and the probability of winning, not just the sum of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference due to equal outcome sums, but the individual chose based on the probability of winning and the comparison of potential gains, not the sum of the outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite having a higher probability of loss, the magnitude of potential losses is smaller, and the maximum possible loss is less than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, whereas the individual considered a broader range of factors including expected value, loss probabilities, and loss magnitudes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, it would suggest indifference. The individual, however, chose based on the size of potential losses and their probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability, so its sum is simply 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability, so its sum is 3000 + (-3000) = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes of each lottery: 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain of Lottery A, the chance of doubling the amount with Lottery B, the equal chance of a high loss with Lottery B, and the expected value of Lottery B being lower than that of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain and Lottery B has a lower expected value and carries the risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (1500 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B), which does not directly align with the individual's considerations (secure gain, chance of doubling, risk of loss, and expected values).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A because 1500 Euros is greater than 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the security of the gain offered by Lottery B, the expected value of both lotteries, and the risk of a high loss associated with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the security and higher expected value of Lottery B over the potential for a higher gain but also a significant risk of loss with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of expected value, security, and risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (in this case, Lottery B because 2000 > 0), but the individual's justification does not mention the sum of outcomes as a factor. Instead, the justification is based on expected value and risk considerations.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities, was used to make the decision. The focus on expected value, security, and risk in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability, so the sum is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability, so the sum is 3000 + (-3000) = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: 1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of each lottery (1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B), the possibility of a higher gain with Lottery B, and the risk of a loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain of 1000 Euros, preferring this over the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (1000 Euros for A, 0 Euros for B), while the individual considered expected values and risk, not the simple sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A because 1000 Euros is greater than 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the security of the gain and the avoidance of potential loss, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of all outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual considered expected values and the risk of loss, rather than simply comparing the sum of outcomes for each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros - 6000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, the chance of a high gain and a high loss in Lottery B, and the fact that Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the high possible loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) does not seem to be considered by the individual, who instead focused on expected values and the potential for gain or loss. 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) does not match the individual's justification (focusing on the potential loss and its probability). 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.
