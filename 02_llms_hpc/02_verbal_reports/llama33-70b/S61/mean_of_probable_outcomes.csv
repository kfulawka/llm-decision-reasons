STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any probability is considered probable since 100% is greater than 1/1 or 100%. Relevant information for Lottery A includes the outcomes of 2500 Euros with 33% probability and 2400 Euros with 66% probability, as both probabilities are higher than the threshold. The 0 Euros outcome with 1% probability is below the threshold and thus not considered probable under this reason. For Lottery B, the 2400 Euros with 100% probability is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A would be (2500*0.33 + 2400*0.66) / (0.33 + 0.66), simplifying to (825 + 1584) / 0.99, which equals 2418.18 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is simply 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers a loss chance of 1% as practically irrelevant but views a 33% chance as significant. They also mention the risk of getting nothing (0 Euros) as negligible in comparison to the potential increase in their probable gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the negligible risk of losing against the potential for a higher gain, implying they are willing to take on a small risk for a potentially higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the significance of the 33% chance and the negligible risk of the 1% chance, which aligns with the decision reason's consideration of probable outcomes based on their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification implies a preference for a higher potential gain despite a small risk, which aligns with choosing the lottery (A) that has a higher average of probable outcomes under the decision reason's criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the probabilities and their focus on the potential for higher gain despite small risks closely align with the decision reason's criteria for evaluating lotteries. While the verbal report does not explicitly calculate or mention averages of probable outcomes, the reasoning provided suggests an intuitive alignment with the decision reason's preference for higher average outcomes from probable results. The assessment is not a perfect 100 because the report does not directly state the calculation or the explicit preference based on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason, but it indicates a strong inclination towards the principles outlined in the reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a 33% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 67% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a 34% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 66% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable for both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros, making them equal in terms of the decision reason's criteria. However, the reason's application depends on the identification of probable outcomes and their averages.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but noted that the chances were not entirely unrealistic. They focused on the trade-off between the potential loss of 100 Euros in the prize money and the increase in the winning chance by one percentage point.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided that mitigating the risk of losing (i.e., increasing the chance of winning, even slightly) was more valuable than having the potential to win 100 Euros more. This suggests the individual was risk-averse and prioritized increasing the probability of a win over the potential amount won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the outcomes with probabilities higher than 50%. However, the individual's consideration was more about the trade-off between the probability increase and the potential prize reduction, not directly about averaging probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule would not differentiate between the lotteries based on their probable outcomes since both have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual, however, made a choice based on mitigating risk and increasing the winning chance, which aligns with preferring a slightly higher probability of winning (even though the decision reason, as defined, does not directly apply due to both lotteries having the same probable outcome).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is more related to risk mitigation and the value of increasing the winning probability, rather than calculating averages of probable outcomes. Thus, while there's a hint of risk consideration that might superficially align with aspects of decision-making under uncertainty, the specific decision reason provided does not seem to be the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there's only one outcome (3000 Euros with 100% probability), so any outcome is considered probable since 1/1 = 1, and 100% is higher than that. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes (4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability), so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Thus, the 4000 Euros outcome is probable, but the 0 Euros outcome is not. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 4000 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Relevant information for the decision reason:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros (100% probability)
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros (80% probability), ignoring the 0 Euros outcome due to its low probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual initially considered applying reverse logic from a previous decision but then focused on the current decision. They compared the risks and benefits, noting the risk of ""losing"" 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and decided it wasn't low enough to ignore.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by focusing on the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of Lottery A, opting for the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), which implies they prioritized avoiding the risk of not winning anything over the potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its higher average probable outcome. However, the individual's consideration was more about the risk of losing and the certainty of gain, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which is Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding risk and preferring a certain outcome, not on comparing the average probable outcomes of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome rather than on the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- Lottery B has a 20% chance of winning 4000 Euros and an 80% chance of winning 0 Euros. The 0 Euro outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
- Lottery A has a 25% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 75% chance of winning 0 Euros. The 0 Euro outcome is probable because its probability (75%) is higher than 50%.
Since both lotteries have one probable outcome each (the 0 Euro outcome), we need to calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. However, since the only probable outcome for both is 0 Euros, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual compares the decision-making process to another scenario involving lotteries with different probabilities and outcomes (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%), suggesting they consider the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount to be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual values significantly increasing their chances of success over maximizing their potential gain in scenarios where the lottery is unlikely but realistically possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of outcomes with probabilities higher than 50%. However, the individual's consideration seems to focus more on the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount, rather than specifically on outcomes with probabilities above 50%.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, values increasing their chances of success, which could align with preferring a lottery based on probability considerations but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific rule about averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of probability and outcome trade-offs and their preference for increasing chances of success do not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially since both lotteries have the same probable outcome average. The focus on increasing success chances might hint at a consideration of probabilities, but it does not directly apply to the decision reason's rule about averages of probable outcomes. Thus, while there's a slight connection in considering probabilities, the core of the decision reason does not seem to be directly applied by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. The decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B as nearly guaranteed and viewed the 45% chance of winning in Lottery A as risky.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) for a win, implying they chose the option with the higher perceived guarantee of a win, which is Lottery B, because 3000 Euros is still a high win value to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery B and the risk associated with the lower probability of winning in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a ""sichere Route"" for a win, valuing the higher probability of a significant, though lesser, amount. This reasoning aligns with preferring the lottery with the more favorable probable outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning closely aligns with the decision reason, focusing on the probability of outcomes and preferring the option with the more guaranteed win, which corresponds to the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes, which introduces some uncertainty. Thus, while it is very likely the decision reason was used, it's not a perfect match, leading to a high but not certain assessment."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). In Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. In Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5. Therefore, for both lotteries, only the 0 Euro outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is also 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and the heights of the prize money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the height of the prize money in case of winning, considering that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also beat a 0.1% chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be the average of the 0 Euro outcomes for both lotteries, since these are the only outcomes with probabilities higher than 0.5. The individual, however, focused on the heights of the prize money and the low probabilities of winning, not directly on the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average of probable outcomes of 0 Euros. The individual, however, chose based on the height of the prize money, which suggests a different decision-making rule than the one specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Only the -4000 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
- Lottery B has one outcome: -3000 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason that can be derived is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. 
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (-4000 Euros) since only the -4000 Euros outcome is probable.
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is (-3000 Euros) since the -3000 Euros outcome is the only outcome and is probable.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the realistisch wahrscheinlichen Verlust (realistically probable loss) of each option and compared the potential loss of Lottery A (an additional 1000€ loss compared to Lottery B if the loss occurs) against the probability of no loss in Lottery A (20%, deemed too low).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified choosing Lottery B (referred to as Option 2) over Lottery A (referred to as Lotterie 1) because the probability of avoiding loss in Lottery A (20%) was too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000€ compared to the certain loss of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is -4000 Euros and for Lottery B is -3000 Euros. The individual considered the realistically probable loss, which aligns with focusing on outcomes with higher probabilities but did not explicitly calculate or mention averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B in this case since -3000 Euros is higher than -4000 Euros. The individual preferred Lottery B because the potential for a lower loss (0 Euros) in Lottery A was not sufficient given its low probability, implying a preference for the certain, though lesser, loss of Lottery B. This rationale is consistent with preferring a less negative outcome when considering probable losses, aligning with the decision reason’s preference for the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's decision process, as described, shows consideration of the probable outcomes and a preference for minimizing loss based on the likelihood of those outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. However, the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention averages of probable outcomes, which introduces some uncertainty about the exact alignment with the decision reason. Therefore, while the assessment leans towards the use of the decision reason, it is not a perfect match, hence the score of 80 rather than 100."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery based on the given probabilities. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- Lottery A: The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
- Lottery B: The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their respective values: for Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the probable outcome is also 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses (Verlustbeträge), indicating that they weighed the risk of losing more against the slight difference in probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that they were not willing to risk a larger loss for a small decrease in probability, and they valued loss amounts higher than gain amounts, implying that the potential higher cost of losing was not worth the 5 percentage points difference in probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case are both 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more about the risk of loss and the valuation of loss versus gain, not directly about the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference based on the risk of larger losses and the valuation of losses over gains, not directly aligning with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's considerations and justifications are centered around the risk of loss and the relative valuation of losses versus gains, rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery A is -3000 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A is -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options and the reduction of loss probability from 90% to 45%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) to avoid the potential loss of 6000 Euros, implying they preferred avoiding the higher loss over the reduction in loss probability.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (0 Euros) over Lottery A (-3000 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (implied by taking the ""sichere Route"" and avoiding the 6000 Euro loss) does not align with the decision reason’s preference for the higher average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 0.5.
For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable for the same reason as above.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is also 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).
Thus, both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes, which is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 0.1% and 0.2% are approximately equally irrelevant for a single trial, suggesting they consider the low-probability outcomes of both lotteries to be similarly insignificant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aimed to minimize the penalty amount in a theoretical unfortunate case, implying they focused on the negative outcomes (-6000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B) and wanted to minimize loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case are the 0 Euros outcomes for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the low-probability negative outcomes and their desire to minimize loss, not directly on the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros). The individual’s justification, however, is based on minimizing the penalty in an unfortunate case, which suggests a focus on the negative outcomes rather than the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. Instead, the individual focuses on minimizing potential loss from the low-probability negative outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome, so its probability of 1.0 makes it a probable outcome by the decision reason's criteria. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their respective values: for Lottery A, both 1000 Euros and 0 Euros are probable; for Lottery B, 500 Euros is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that both options were mathematically equal in value but emphasizes the importance of ensuring a gain over maximizing potential further gain, given previous additional rewards. This implies the individual considered the value of certainty versus potential.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred ensuring a gain (implying a preference for a certain outcome) over the potential for a higher gain, suggesting a risk-averse approach in the context of having already received additional rewards.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which was calculated as 500 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the certainty of gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. Given that both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (500 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the value of a certain gain, aligning with choosing Lottery B but not explicitly because it has a higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on ensuring a gain and the mathematical equality of the options suggest some alignment with considering outcomes, but the decision reason's specific rule about averages of probable outcomes does not directly match the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B. The verbal report indicates a preference for certainty over potential maximum gain, which indirectly aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (as both lotteries are valued equally by the reason), but the reasoning process described does not explicitly follow the decision reason's criteria. Thus, while there is some conceptual overlap, the individual's decision-making process as described does not closely follow the decision reason's specific logic."

Decision reason:
The reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery. An outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so its single outcome is considered probable by default since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- For Lottery A, both outcomes are probable because both have a 50% probability, which meets the criteria. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the single outcome of -500 Euros is probable, and its average (since there's only one outcome) is -500 Euros.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the average of probable outcomes for each lottery, which is -500 Euros for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""50% is still a relevant chance on an outcome,"" indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided ""to minimize the absolute possible loss value."" This implies they focused on reducing the maximum potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, while the individual considered the relevance of a 50% chance and aimed to minimize the absolute possible loss value. The individual's consideration of probabilities aligns with the decision reason's requirement but focuses more on minimizing loss rather than directly calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (-500 Euros), so the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, aimed to minimize the absolute possible loss, which could indirectly relate to considering the outcomes but doesn't directly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on minimizing absolute loss and considering probabilities shows some alignment with the concepts relevant to the decision reason, but the direct application of calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes to make the decision is not clearly evident from the verbal report. The decision reason's specific rule about averaging probable outcomes and the individual's justification do not closely match, indicating the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. 
For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 75% probability, since 75% is higher than 50%.
For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability, since 50% is higher than 33.33%, and no other outcome meets this criterion.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considered the amounts of money (excluding zero) to be large and made their decision based on which option gave them a higher probability of winning a large amount.
The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the probability of winning a large amount, ignoring the specific values of the large amounts.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning a large amount), there seems to be a discrepancy. The decision reason specifically looks at outcomes with probabilities higher than a certain threshold and calculates an average based on those, whereas the individual's focus is on winning a large amount without explicitly considering the probability threshold for what constitutes a ""probable"" outcome.
The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average of 0 Euros for their probable outcomes. However, the individual's justification is about the probability of winning a large amount, not directly about comparing averages of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 (approximately 33.33%). For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 (50%). 
For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros (50% probability) since it's the only outcome exceeding the 33.33% threshold.
For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros (75% probability) since it exceeds the 50% threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros.
This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the importance of minimizing the chance of losing money, given that the losses would be significant in all cases.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized minimizing the chance of losing money, considering a 25 percentage point higher chance of not losing anything as more important than reducing the amount of loss in the unlikely event of a bad outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on minimizing the chance of losing money and considered the difference in probabilities of not losing (25 percentage points higher chance with Lottery A due to its 50% chance of 0 Euros compared to Lottery B's 75% chance of 0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have an average of probable outcomes of 0 Euros, the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, prioritized the higher probability of not losing money, which aligns with preferring Lottery A due to its structure offering a 50% chance of not losing, but this reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason’s focus on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on minimizing the chance of losing money and the importance placed on the probability of not losing aligns with considering aspects of the lotteries that the decision reason also touches upon (probable outcomes and their implications), but the specific rule of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) does not directly match the individual's justification. The decision reason's application leads to indifference since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), whereas the individual's decision-making process led to a clear preference based on a related but distinct criterion (probability of avoiding loss). Thus, while there is some overlap in considerations, the individual's reasoning does not closely follow the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. Given this, for Lottery A, only the 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability is considered probable because 99.9% > 0.5. For Lottery B, the 5 Euros outcome with 100% probability is considered probable because 100% > 1. The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of these probable outcomes: for Lottery A, it's 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it's 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that a 0.1% probability is ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), indicating they considered the low probability of the high outcome in Lottery A. They also mention preferring a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot, which suggests they considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for a guaranteed small gain (Lottery B) over the low-probability chance of a large gain (Lottery A), describing the latter as an ""illusion.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 5 Euros for Lottery B. The individual considered the low probability of the high outcome in Lottery A and the guaranteed nature of Lottery B, which aligns with the identification of probable outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (5 Euros) over Lottery A (0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A is based on preferring a guaranteed small win, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher average probable outcome, given that the only probable outcomes considered are the guaranteed ones.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason's rule, focusing on the preference for the guaranteed outcome due to its higher probability, thus treating it as the more probable and desirable outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1 is not applicable in this context, as the condition is always met for a single outcome. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -5000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is lower than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
For Lottery B, the outcome of -5 Euros has a probability of 100%, making it a probable outcome.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A as extremely unattractive at first, which drew them to Option B. Then, they looked at the probability distribution in Lottery A and noted that the 0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros is so small that the risk is negligible, making a loss of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, after considering the negligible risk of the significant loss, they believed the effective outcome was a guaranteed 0 Euros, which they found more attractive than the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual considered the probabilities and the attractiveness of the outcomes but did not explicitly calculate or mention the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery A because they considered the risk of the large loss negligible, effectively treating it as if the guaranteed outcome was 0 Euros, which aligns with focusing on the probable outcome but does not explicitly follow the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's reasoning process, as described, aligns partially with the decision reason in that they focus on the probable outcomes (in this case, treating the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery A as the only probable one due to its high probability). However, they do not explicitly calculate or compare the averages of these outcomes as the decision reason dictates. Their choice is based on the attractiveness of having a practically guaranteed 0 Euro loss versus a certain loss of 5 Euros, which suggests an intuitive application of the concept of probable outcomes but not a strict adherence to the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not a clear, direct application of the decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, which meets this criterion. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. Lottery B's single outcome has a probability of 1, meeting this criterion. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (3000 + (-3000))/2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the average (and only outcome) is 1500 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical expectation (Mittelwert) of each lottery. For Lottery A, they noted that over many attempts, the average gain would be 0 Euros due to the equal probability of gaining or losing 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, they recognized it offered a guaranteed (100% chance) gain of 1500 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the expected outcomes of the two lotteries, focusing on the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome versus the uncertain, zero-average outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the identification of probable outcomes and their average. The individual considered the average outcomes (or expected values) of the lotteries, which aligns with calculating the average of probable outcomes as the decision reason suggests. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offered a guaranteed, positive outcome (1500 Euros) over Lottery A's zero-average outcome, which aligns with preferring a higher average outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, they are both considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, so it is considered probable by default. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery B, both 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros are probable; for Lottery A, 2000 Euros is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a previous similar decision and notes that the safe option (Lottery A) is now even more attractive, comparing it to a guaranteed 1500 Euros, though the actual guaranteed amount in Lottery A is 2000 Euros. This suggests the individual is focusing on the certainty and attractiveness of Lottery A compared to the riskier Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision is described as ""selbstverständlich"" (obvious or self-evident), implying that the choice was clear to the individual, likely due to the guaranteed nature of Lottery A being more appealing than the risk of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (identification of probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (certainty and attractiveness of Lottery A, comparison to a previous similar decision), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual does consider the certainty of Lottery A, which aligns with evaluating the probable (or certain, in this case) outcomes, but there's no explicit mention of calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification (the obvious choice due to the attractiveness of the guaranteed option), there is a conceptual alignment in preferring the more attractive, certain option (Lottery A) over the risky one (Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment indicates that while there are elements in the verbal report that suggest the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason (such as the attractiveness of the certain option), the explicit application of the decision reason (calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes) is not clearly described in the report. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there are hints that the individual's thought process might have been influenced by similar considerations, albeit not explicitly stated in the manner defined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, making both outcomes probable. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome with a 100% probability, making it probable. The relevant information for Lottery A is that both outcomes are probable, with values of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 1000 Euros. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the guaranteed gain of Lottery B (1000 Euros) to the average value of Lottery A, indicating they considered the outcomes and their implications. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by noting that while the guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery B is significantly less than the potential gain from Lottery A, it is still more than the average value of Lottery A, suggesting a consideration of the average or expected value of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which the individual seems to have done by mentioning the comparison between the guaranteed gain of Lottery B and the implied average of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification implies a preference for Lottery B because its guaranteed outcome is more than the average value of Lottery A, aligning with preferring the lottery with a higher (or in this case, a less negative) average outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual considered the essence of the decision reason, focusing on the average outcomes and comparing them to make their decision. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state the individual calculated and compared the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's reasoning is more intuitive and less formal than the decision reason's rule but leads to a similar conclusion based on the information provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, making them both probable. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1. The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of these probable outcomes. For Lottery B, the average is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average is 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that one of the options (Lottery A) was not a lottery and involved no risk, while the other option (Lottery B) had a risk of losing 6000 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by excluding Lottery B due to the potential loss of 6000 Euros, stating that the probabilities became irrelevant at that point.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more about the presence of risk in one option and its potential negative outcome rather than calculating or comparing averages of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have an average of 0 Euros, the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, made a decision based on the risk associated with one of the lotteries, not by comparing averages or applying the rule specified by the decision reason.
