Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery: 4900 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains from each lottery, focusing on the maximum amount that can be won and the difference between the outcomes of the two lotteries. They also acknowledged the possibility of winning nothing in Lottery A but dismissed it due to its low probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed it offered the highest potential gain ""rechnerisch"" (computationally), implying a calculation-based approach. They rationalized ignoring the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A, considering it negligible compared to the potential increase from the 100 Euro difference between the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the basis for the decision. However, the individual does mention choosing Lottery A because ""man dort rechnerisch am meisten gewinnt,"" which suggests a computational approach that could align with summing outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on a computational approach that focuses on the potential for the highest gain, which might align with preferring the higher sum of outcomes but does not directly state that the sum of all outcomes was the deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report suggests a computational or calculation-based approach to choosing Lottery A, focusing on the potential for the highest gain and rationalizing the dismissal of low-probability outcomes. While this approach aligns with the general principle of the decision reason (preferring the option with the higher outcome sum), the report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on summing all outcomes of each lottery. Therefore, there is some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied, leading to an assessment that leans towards the use of the decision reason but is not certain."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2400 Euros (since the 0 Euros outcome does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is 2500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these sums, which is 2400 Euros for A and 2500 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery (noting that a win is more probable in A), the amount of the win in each lottery (noting that the win is higher in B), and the difference between the wins and the probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing B because, despite the higher probability of winning in A, the higher potential win in B and the greater difference between the wins compared to the probabilities suggested that ""statistically"" more money could be won with B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered probabilities and the comparative differences between outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual also chose B but based on a rationale involving the comparison of potential wins and the probabilistic outcomes, not the simple sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on a comparison of the potential wins and their probabilities, not on the sum of the outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which considers only the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability, so the sum is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a total outcome sum of 3000 Euros and Lottery B has a total outcome sum of 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of 3000 Euros from Lottery A and the expected value of Lottery B, calculated as 4000 Euros * 0.8 = 3200 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual initially preferred Lottery A due to its certain gain but then chose Lottery B after calculating its expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes for each lottery (3000 Euros for A and 4000 Euros for B), but the individual considered the certain gain of A and the expected value of B (3200 Euros), not the sum of outcomes for B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B), but the individual's justification is based on the expected value of Lottery B, not the sum of its outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason as described because they considered the expected value of Lottery B rather than the sum of its outcomes, and their justification for choosing Lottery B was based on this expected value, not the sum of outcomes as the decision reason requires."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 Euros + 0 Euros = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the theoretical winnings of both lotteries, calculating them as 800 Euros for Lottery A and 750 Euros for Lottery B. It seems the individual applied some form of calculation to the outcomes but did not explicitly mention considering the probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because its theoretical winnings (800 Euros) were higher than those of Lottery B (750 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is 4000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B. The individual, however, considered the ""theoretical winnings"" of 800 Euros for A and 750 Euros for B, which suggests a different calculation, possibly factoring in the probabilities (20% of 4000 = 800, 25% of 3000 = 750). This indicates a mismatch in how the information was considered.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes (4000 Euros for A vs. 3000 Euros for B), which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual also preferred Lottery A but based on a different calculation (theoretical winnings of 800 Euros vs. 750 Euros), which aligns with the preference but not the reasoning process specified by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's calculation and justification, focusing on ""theoretical winnings"" that seem to incorporate probabilities, do not align with the decision reason's rule of simply summing the outcomes independent of their probabilities. Thus, despite both leading to a preference for Lottery A, the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros) and for Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has an outcome sum of 3000 Euros and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 6000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (rechnerisch um 2700 Euro) of both lotteries, which suggests they looked at the probabilities and outcomes. They mention looking at both lotteries and calculating something related to their value.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning something is higher in A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (6000 Euros for B and 3000 Euros for A), but the individual considered the expected value and the probability of winning, not just the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the probability of winning, not the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. Since 6000 Euros is greater than 3000 Euros, according to this reason, Lottery B would be preferred. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the sum of the outcomes (referred to as ""Gewinnsummen"") of both lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing between the lotteries was based on the fact that the probability of winning nothing (or ""komplett leer auszugehen"") was lower in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, while the individual considered both the probabilities and the outcome sums but made their decision based on the probability of not winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule, as they chose based on the probability of not winning, not the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the sum for Lottery A is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses from both lotteries, specifically mentioning the loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B and a calculated loss of 3200 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is only 3000 Euros, compared to a calculated loss of 3200 Euros in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is -4000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, calculated a loss of 3200 Euros for Lottery A, which suggests they might have considered the expected value or a similar calculation rather than simply summing the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative in this case), which would be Lottery B with -3000 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was to minimize loss, which aligns with preferring the less negative outcome but does not explicitly match the decision reason’s rule of summing outcomes independent of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of summing all outcomes independent of their probabilities. The mention of a ""calculated loss of 3200 Euro"" for Lottery A suggests the use of probabilities in the calculation (likely an expected value calculation, where -4000*0.8 + 0*0.2 = -3200), which is not in line with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as specified."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (-3000 is greater than -4000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected loss (or ""rechnerisch verliere"") of each lottery, calculating a loss of 750 Euros for Lottery B and 800 Euros for Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the calculated loss was less (750 Euros) compared to Lottery A (800 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-4000 for A, -3000 for B), while the individual considered the calculated loss (which implies a consideration of probabilities and outcomes together, not just the sum of outcomes).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative), which would be Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on a different calculation (expected loss), not the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. Since the sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss in both lotteries and the probability of losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the lower probability of losing any amount, not the total outcome sum.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (total outcome sums) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts and probabilities): The individual did not consider the total outcome sums as per the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (preferring based on the lower probability of losing): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros (since the 0 Euro outcome does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of both lotteries and noted that the factor/divisor is 2 for both, implying a comparison of the probabilities and outcomes. The individual also considered the absolute loss of each lottery.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the absolute loss being smaller (3000 Euros) and less intimidating, despite being twice as probable as the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, absolute loss), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the sum of outcomes as the decision reason requires.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the smaller absolute loss due to it being less intimidating), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on the psychological impact of the loss rather than the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 1000 + 0 = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 500 Euros. Since these sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered both lotteries (A and B), looked at their outcomes and the concept of multiplying the outcome by its probability, implying they considered the expected value or a similar metric.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it provides a guaranteed outcome, implying a preference for certainty over the risk of getting nothing with Lottery A. They mention that the ""Ergebnis aus Gewinnsumme und Wahrscheinlichkeit multipliziert"" (result from the sum of winnings and probability multiplied) is the same, which suggests they were considering an aspect of expected value rather than the sum of outcomes as per the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes (1000 for A, 500 for B), but the individual considered the concept of multiplying outcomes by probabilities, not just the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the guarantee it offers and an implicit consideration of expected value or risk, not the sum of outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -1000 Euros + 0 Euros = -1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a sum of -1000 Euros, and Lottery B has a sum of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the perceived loss of each lottery in relation to their current wealth (2000 Euros) and compared the potential loss of 1000 Euros in Lottery A to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the certain loss of 500 Euros seemed less painful compared to the potential loss of 1000 Euros, considering their current wealth.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-1000 Euros for A, -500 Euros for B), while the individual considered the perceived pain of losses in relation to their current wealth, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B since -500 Euros is greater than -1000 Euros), but the individual's justification is based on the perceived pain of loss and current wealth, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the sum of its outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same outcome sum. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the statistical expectation (or average win) of each lottery, which they calculated as 1500 Euros for both, and the probability of winning nothing, noting it's halved in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to ""play it safe"" because the probability of winning nothing is lower in Lottery B, leading them to choose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual discusses expected values and probabilities of losing, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, it would be indifferent. However, the individual chose based on minimizing the risk of winning nothing, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual considered expected values and the risk of losing, whereas the decision reason is based solely on the sum of all possible outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. Since the individual's justification and the decision reason's rule do not match, and the individual did not consider the sum of outcomes as the basis for their decision, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
14,"assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 - 2000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. Both lotteries have the same outcome sum, which is -6000 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied but would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since their sums are equal.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected loss (rechnerisch 1500 Euro) in both lotteries and the distribution of losses (in three-quarters of the cases, nothing is lost in Lottery A, but the loss is higher in the remaining quarter compared to Lottery B).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the higher loss in one-quarter of the cases, they preferred the scenario where they lose nothing in three-quarters of the cases, even though the loss in the other cases is higher than in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, which is the same for both lotteries. The individual, however, considered the expected loss and the distribution of outcomes, not just the sum of outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference because both lotteries have the same outcome sum. The individual, however, made a choice based on the distribution of potential losses and the preference for avoiding losses in most cases, not based on the sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, as they considered different factors (expected loss and distribution of outcomes) and the decision reason would have led to indifference due to equal outcome sums.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 5000 Euros + 0 Euros = 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 5 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived, we can apply this reason to the decision problem. The relevant information is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum (5000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the ""rechnerische Gesamtsumme"" (computational total sum) of the lotteries and found it to be the same, implying they calculated the sum of the outcomes. They also considered the attractiveness of the outcomes, specifically mentioning that 5000 Euros were very enticing, while 5 Euros seemed negligible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that although the computational total sum was the same (which seems to be a misunderstanding since the actual calculation should favor A due to its higher outcome), the potential to win 5000 Euros was more appealing than the guarantee of 5 Euros, which seemed like ""gar nichts"" (almost nothing).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the computational total sum but misunderstood its implications, as they stated it was the same for both lotteries, which contradicts the actual calculation favoring Lottery A. However, they did consider the outcomes, which is in line with the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but not strictly because of the higher outcome sum as per the decision reason. Instead, they were swayed by the attractiveness of the potential win, despite acknowledging the computational aspect.

The individual's decision process and justification share some elements with the decision reason, such as considering the outcomes. However, the misunderstanding of the computational total sum and the emphasis on the attractiveness of the potential win rather than strictly following the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher outcome sum independent of probabilities suggest that the decision reason was not the primary driver of their choice. Thus, the assessment is closer to certain that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges some overlap in considerations."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -5000 + 0 = -5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -5 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: -5000 Euros for Lottery A and -5 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at both lotteries and considered the statistical aspect of losing money, focusing on the high probability of not losing any money in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because of the high probability of not losing any money, indicating a focus on the probability of outcomes rather than their sum.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (statistical aspect and probability of not losing money). The individual's focus was on probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the high probability of not losing money). The decision reason and the individual's justification are based on different criteria.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason (focusing on the sum of outcomes) does not match the individual's deliberation process (focusing on probabilities and the likelihood of not losing money).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 1500 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcome sums of the two lotteries: 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries and considered the guaranteed win of 1500 Euros in Lottery A and the fact that Lottery B, when calculated, results in zero.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win of 1500 Euros, and Lottery B, when calculated (implying some form of evaluation), results in zero.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sums of outcomes for each lottery, which are 1500 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B. The individual considered the guaranteed win of A and the calculated zero outcome of B, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum. The individual's justification for choosing A over B is that A offers a positive, guaranteed amount, while B calculates to zero, which suggests a preference for the higher (or non-zero) outcome sum.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's criteria and rule, indicating a high certainty that the decision reason was used to make the decision. The individual's calculation and preference for the non-zero outcome (1500 Euros) over the zero outcome (resulting from the calculation of Lottery B's outcomes) directly reflect the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome sum is 2000 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the outcome sum is 3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its outcome sum (2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the guaranteed win of 2000 Euros from Lottery A and the calculated outcome of 0 Euros from Lottery B. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the attractiveness of a guaranteed win of 2000 Euros compared to a calculated outcome of 0 Euros from Lottery B. The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome from Lottery A and the lack of a positive outcome from Lottery B when considering their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcome sums of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win of Lottery A and calculated outcome of Lottery B) shows some alignment, as both involve considering the outcomes of the lotteries. However, the individual's consideration is more focused on the certainty of the outcome and the calculated outcome rather than simply summing outcomes independent of probabilities. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual's justification (preferring the guaranteed win over a calculated zero outcome) indicates the individual's reasoning aligns with preferring a positive, certain outcome over a potentially neutral or risky one, but does not explicitly state a preference based on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities. The individual's reasoning seems more aligned with risk aversion or a preference for certainty rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and some aspects of their reasoning align with the outcomes considered by the decision reason, their justification is more closely related to the certainty of the win and the calculated outcome rather than the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, indicating the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 + (-3000) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcome of Lottery A, recognizing it results in zero when calculated, and the outcome of Lottery B, noting it results in a win every time. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it results in a win every time, implying a preference for a guaranteed positive outcome over a lottery that ""remains at zero"" when calculated.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the calculation of outcomes for both lotteries, which aligns with the decision reason's requirement to sum the outcomes. However, the individual's focus was more on the guaranteed win of Lottery B rather than the sum of outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B since 1000 > 0. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a comparison of sums, implies a preference for the guaranteed positive outcome of Lottery B, which indirectly aligns with preferring the non-zero sum but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing sums of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason's specific rule (comparing the sum of all outcomes independent of probabilities). The individual's focus on the guaranteed win and the calculation resulting in zero for Lottery A suggests a different rationale for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros - 6000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have an outcome sum of 0 Euros, making them equal according to this reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions looking at both lotteries (A and B) and notes that the results are ""rechnerisch dieselben,"" which translates to ""the same in terms of calculation."" This suggests the individual considered the calculated outcomes or values of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take a risk and chose Lottery A. The justification provided is based on the perception of risk rather than a direct comparison of the calculated sums of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual seems to acknowledge that the results are the same in terms of calculation, which might align with the concept of outcome sums but does not explicitly mention considering the sums of outcomes as the basis for the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same outcome sum. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on a willingness to take a risk, not because of the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision was based on a willingness to take a risk rather than the sum of the outcomes of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes) was used to make the decision, as the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was unrelated to the sum of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
