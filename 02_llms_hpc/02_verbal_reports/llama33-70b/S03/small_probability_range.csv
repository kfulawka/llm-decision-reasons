STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probability are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 0% difference
- Lottery B: 65% difference

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes of A and B and then the chances, focusing on the three outcomes of B and considering the 1% chance of 0€ as insignificant.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seemed to focus on the fairness of getting 2400 or 2500 Euros in Lottery B, downplaying the importance of the 1% chance of getting 0€.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discussed the outcomes and the perceived fairness of the chances but did not directly address the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 0% difference. However, the individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as they discussed the fairness of the outcomes in Lottery B and the insignificance of the 1% chance, without mentioning the comparative probability spreads.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the smaller difference. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 32% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries (33% vs. 34%) and mentioned that the 1% difference between these probabilities does not play a significant role in their decision. They also considered the potential gain from winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because of the higher potential gain if they win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's verbal report discusses the difference between the probabilities of winning (1% difference between 33% and 34%) rather than the range of probabilities (which would be the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities for each lottery, i.e., 32% for A and 34% for B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (32% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B because of the higher potential gain, not because of the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not the basis for the individual's choice. Instead, the individual's decision was influenced by the higher potential gain of Lottery B and the insignificant difference in winning probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for this reason includes the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for 3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual first considered the potential outcomes (how much one can win) and then looked at the probabilities. The individual mentions the 80% probability of winning 4000 Euros in Lottery A but also notes the 20% chance of losing. They justify their choice by stating that it is safer to opt for the 100% guarantee of 3000 Euros in Lottery B, rather than risking the loss in Lottery A. The focus is on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B versus the risk in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual did think about the probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Instead, they focused on the presence of risk in Lottery A and the certainty of gain in Lottery B. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 0% difference. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the safety of a guaranteed win, which aligns with preferring a lottery due to its lack of risk (or in this context, its 0% difference between minimum and maximum probabilities), but does not explicitly state it in terms of the decision reason's specific criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), the explicit consideration and application of the decision reason's criteria (comparing the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities) are not clearly stated in the verbal report. The individual's focus on the safety and certainty of the outcome in Lottery B indirectly aligns with the preference for the smaller difference in probabilities, but the direct application of the decision reason is not explicitly mentioned."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (60% for A and 50% for B). This information is crucial for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains between A and B and then looked at the probabilities. Specifically, they mentioned the attractiveness of Lottery B due to its 25% chance of winning 3000 Euros compared to the 20% chance in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the 25% chance of winning in Lottery B is more attractive than the 20% chance in Lottery A, regardless of the 100€ difference (which seems to be a misunderstanding since the difference in potential winnings is actually 1000€ between the two lotteries).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities (60% for A and 50% for B), but the individual's verbal report does not mention comparing these differences explicitly. Instead, they focused on the absolute probabilities of winning.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 50% difference. However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived higher chance of winning with Lottery B (25% vs. 20%) and not on the difference in probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the decision reason's criteria (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) in their verbal report. The focus was more on the comparative attractiveness of the winning probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0, since probabilities are usually expressed as decimal values between 0 and 1, but in this context, it refers to the chance of getting 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (the chance of getting 6000 Euros), so the difference is 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0, the chance of getting 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (the chance of getting 3000 Euros), so the difference is 90%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A since 45% is less than 90%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities of both lotteries, focusing on the higher probability of winning in Lottery B (90%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it is ""sicherer"" (safer) to win with a 90% probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which the individual does not explicitly mention in their verbal report. Instead, the individual focuses on the higher winning probability of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A, not Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery B because of its higher winning probability, not because of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, nor does their justification for choosing Lottery B align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (99.6%) compared to Lottery B (99.8%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and the amounts that could be won (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros), but stated that the amounts were relatively unimportant due to the low probabilities of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the lower probability, the potential gain of 6000 Euros was more appealing if one were to win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor influencing the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its smaller difference in probabilities, but the individual chose Lottery B based on the potential gain if one were to win, not the difference in probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference in probabilities, which was not a factor mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (-4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probability is the same, 100% (-3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences of 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 100% probability in Lottery B and the chance of 20% to lose 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to take advantage of the 20% chance to lose 0 Euros, indicating a desire to ""sicher zu gehen, falls man Glück hat"" (be safe if one is lucky).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries but did not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing the chance to lose 0 Euros, which does not directly relate to the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the chance to lose 0 Euros, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since the individual's reasoning does not match the decision reason's criteria, I am certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes (-4000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B) and their corresponding probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the potential losses (-4000 Euros vs -3000 Euros) and stated that the 25% probability of Lottery B ""hat keine große Rolle gespielt"" (played no significant role), implying that the probability difference between the two lotteries was not a crucial factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of probability differences between the lotteries, but the individual focused on the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities without explicitly discussing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing these differences as the basis for their choice. The individual's focus was on the magnitude of potential losses rather than the probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason in question. The individual's justification focuses on the outcomes and the impact of one specific probability, rather than the range of probabilities as required by the decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for the outcome -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for the outcome 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for the outcome 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (for the outcome -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss and its associated probability for each lottery, focusing on minimizing the loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the potential loss in Lottery A (-6000 Euros with a 45% chance) was deemed too high, and Lottery B was seen as a way to minimize loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on minimizing loss based on the potential outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (difference of 10%) over Lottery B (difference of 80%). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on minimizing loss, not explicitly considering the probability differences as defined by the decision reason. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the specific decision reason provided to make the decision, as their justification is centered around loss minimization rather than the probability differences between outcomes.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (99.6%) between its minimum and maximum probabilities compared to Lottery B (99.8%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss (Verlust) and then compared the chances between the two options. They noted that the chances of losing under 0.2% are very low for both, which did not play a significant role in their final decision. The key factor was the lower loss of -3000€ in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of the lower potential loss (-3000€ compared to -6000€ in Lottery B).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the lower potential loss, not the difference in probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), but since the actual minimum probability is 50% for the outcome that occurs, the correct minimum and maximum probabilities to consider in the context of the decision reason are both 50% for the two distinct outcomes, thus the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), so the difference is also 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the gains (outcomes) of both lotteries and then compared the chances (probabilities) of winning between Lottery A and Lottery B. They were attracted to the potential high gain of Lottery A but were also aware of the 50% chance of losing. They opted for Lottery B to ensure a gain of 500 Euros with 100% certainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A was to avoid the risk of losing (the 50% chance of getting 0 Euros) and to ensure a certain gain of 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more about the attractiveness of the outcomes and the risk of losing, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between Lottery A and B since both have a difference of 0% when considering the actual decision context. The individual, however, chose based on the certainty of the gain, which aligns more with risk aversion than with the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's focus was on ensuring a gain and avoiding loss, rather than on the probability differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probability of losing half of their initial amount (1000 Euros) with Lottery A, which they found too high at 50%. They also compared Lotteries A and B. 
Second, the individual justified their choice by stating that it is safer to lose 500 Euros (with Lottery B) than 1000 Euros (with Lottery A), indicating a preference for the certain loss of 500 Euros over the risky loss of 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probability ranges for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the probability of losing and the comparison between the two lotteries), it appears the individual focused on the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (safer to lose 500 Euros than 1000 Euros), the individual's reasoning does not explicitly match the decision reason’s rule, as they did not mention the probability ranges but rather the outcomes and their perceived safety.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for both 2000 and 4000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 75%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%. For Lottery B, the difference is 75% - 25% = 50%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and gains of Lottery A with those of Lottery B, focusing on the attractiveness of winning something in three different scenarios with Lottery A, given its split chances. They also considered the risk of not earning anything with Lottery B as too high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the attractiveness of having multiple chances to win something with Lottery A and the high risk of winning nothing with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was more on the distribution of outcomes and the perceived risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (25% difference) over Lottery B (50% difference). The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges but does express a preference for Lottery A due to its multiple winning scenarios and lower perceived risk of winning nothing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. While the individual prefers Lottery A, the justification provided in the verbal report emphasizes the attractiveness of multiple winning scenarios and the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than the specific probability differences that the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, giving a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, giving a maximum difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery: 50% for A and 25% for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of losses in each lottery and then considered the probabilities. Specifically, they looked at the highest loss in each lottery and its associated probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the maximum potential loss in each lottery and its probability, focusing on why Lottery A's maximum loss of -6000€ at a 25% chance was deemed too high, while Lottery B's maximum losses were more acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probability differences) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts and their probabilities), it's clear the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the acceptability of loss amounts given their probabilities), the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on the magnitude of potential losses and their associated probabilities, not on the range of probabilities themselves.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for the 5000 Euros outcome), making the difference 0.1%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100%, making the difference 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential reward of Lottery A (5000 Euros) but was deterred by its low probability (0.1%). They also considered the guaranteed, though smaller, reward of Lottery B (5 Euros with 100% probability).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the guaranteed chance of winning, despite the lower amount, was more appealing than the very low chance of winning a larger amount with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the attractiveness of the reward versus the probability of winning, not explicitly on the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification, while choosing Lottery B, was based on the guarantee of winning a smaller amount rather than the probability range.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason emphasizes the difference in probability ranges, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the guarantee of a smaller reward over a highly uncertain larger reward.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 0.998. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, focusing on the low loss chance of Lottery B (0.1%) compared to the guaranteed loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on the attractiveness of Lottery B due to its low probability of loss, preferring to rely on the possibility of getting 0 Euros instead of a guaranteed loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A. The deliberation process described focuses on the probability of loss and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities, focusing on the low loss chance), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery B due to its low loss chance and the guaranteed loss in Lottery A), the individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on the probability of loss and the guaranteed outcome rather than the difference in probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%) between their minimum and maximum probabilities, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability distributions of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing with Lottery B (50% chance of losing), the potential gain of Lottery B compared to Lottery A, and the guaranteed win of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the risk associated with Lottery B was too high, and they preferred the guaranteed win of Lottery A over the potential higher gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing, potential gain, guaranteed win). The individual's considerations do not directly match the decision reason's focus on the probability differences.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the guaranteed win due to high risk in Lottery B). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries, but the individual preferred Lottery A due to risk aversion rather than the probability difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences to decide, we must note that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the reason's applicability hinges on the concept of risk aversion or preference for certainty, which is implicit in the comparison of probability ranges. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery A and the risk of loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the high risk of loss associated with Lottery B, implying a preference for the certainty offered by Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability differences within each lottery, but the individual's consideration was more about the risk (probability of loss) and certainty of the outcomes rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the internal probability ranges of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a 0% difference. However, the individual's justification implies a preference for certainty (Lottery A) over the risk of loss (Lottery B), which aligns with the spirit of avoiding high-risk scenarios but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the certainty of Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about comparing the differences in probability ranges within each lottery. The verbal report suggests a more intuitive risk aversion rather than an explicit consideration of the probability differences as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a hint of risk consideration, it does not directly match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0% and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing with Lottery B and the attractiveness of the potential gain, as well as the guarantee of a gain with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to ensure a guaranteed gain of 100%, due to the high risk of losing with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more focused on the risk and guarantee of gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would lead to indifference. However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding risk and ensuring a guaranteed gain, not on comparing probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implied, as there is only one outcome) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of Lottery A, focusing on the possibility of winning or losing and the 50% chance associated with each outcome. They also considered the certain outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A was too high, and thus, they preferred the safety of receiving 0 Euros with a 100% probability in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual discussed probabilities, their focus was on the risk of losing in Lottery A and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, not explicitly on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 0%. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the certainty of the outcome as their reason, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome over a risky one but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, focuses on the risk and certainty of outcomes rather than the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
