small variance
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities to calculate their variances. 
   For Lottery A:
   - Calculate the expected value (EV):
     EV_A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 + 0 = 2409 Euros.
   - Calculate the variance:
     Variance_A = [ (2500 - 2409)² * 0.33 ] + [ (2400 - 2409)² * 0.66 ] + [ (0 - 2409)² * 0.01 ] 
                = [ (91)² * 0.33 ] + [ (-9)² * 0.66 ] + [ (2409)² * 0.01 ]
                = [ 8281 * 0.33 ] + [ 81 * 0.66 ] + [ 5805681 * 0.01 ]
                = 2732.73 + 53.46 + 58056.81 = 60742.
   
   For Lottery B:
   - Since it is a single outcome:
     EV_B = 2400 Euros, and the variance is 0 because there is no variability in outcomes.

2. Compare the variances: 
   - Variance_A = 60742 
   - Variance_B = 0
   Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance, and given that B has a variance of 0 while A has a higher variance, I prefer Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Evaluate the outcomes and probabilities of each lottery to determine if relevant information can be derived. 
- For Lottery A:
  - Outcomes: 2500 Euros (33% probability), 0 Euros (67% probability) 
  - To calculate the variance of Lottery A:
    - E(A) = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros
    - E(A^2) = (2500^2 * 0.33) + (0^2 * 0.67) = 2077500 Euros
    - Variance(A) = E(A^2) - (E(A))^2 = 2077500 - (825^2) ≈ 2077500 - 680625 = 1396875 Euros

- For Lottery B:
  - Outcomes: 2400 Euros (34% probability), 0 Euros (66% probability) 
  - To calculate the variance of Lottery B:
    - E(B) = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros
    - E(B^2) = (2400^2 * 0.34) + (0^2 * 0.66) = 1936000 Euros
    - Variance(B) = E(B^2) - (E(B))^2 = 1936000 - (816^2) ≈ 1936000 - 665856 = 1269444 Euros

We have computed the variances: 
- Variance(A) ≈ 1396875 Euros 
- Variance(B) ≈ 1269444 Euros

Since we can derive the necessary variance data, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the smaller variance.
Comparing the variances: 
Variance(A) ≈ 1396875 Euros and Variance(B) ≈ 1269444 Euros. 
Since 1269444 < 1396875, Decision Reason prefers Lottery B as it has the smaller variance.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: First, we need to calculate the variance for both lotteries to apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller variance.

For Lottery A:
Expected value (E(A)) = (4000 Euros * 0.8) + (0 Euros * 0.2) = 3200 Euros
Variance (Var(A)) = E(A^2) - (E(A))^2
E(A^2) = (4000^2 * 0.8) + (0^2 * 0.2) = 12800000 Euros
Var(A) = 12800000 - (3200)^2 = 12800000 - 10240000 = 2560000 Euros

For Lottery B:
Expected value (E(B)) = 3000 Euros (since it has a certainty of 100%)
Variance (Var(B)) = E(B^2) - (E(B))^2
E(B^2) = (3000^2 * 1) = 9000000 Euros
Var(B) = 9000000 - (3000)^2 = 9000000 - 9000000 = 0 Euros

Lottery A has a variance of 2560000 Euros, while Lottery B has a variance of 0 Euros.

Step 2: The decision reason dictates that we prefer the lottery with the smaller variance. Since Lottery B has a variance of 0 Euros, which is smaller than Lottery A's variance of 2560000 Euros, we prefer Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries’ outcomes and probabilities. 
For Lottery A:
- Mean (Expected Value) = (4000 Euros * 0.20) + (0 Euros * 0.80) = 800 Euros
- Variance = (0.20 * (4000 - 800)²) + (0.80 * (0 - 800)²) = (0.20 * 33640000) + (0.80 * 640000) = 6728000 + 512000 = 7248000 Euros²

For Lottery B:
- Mean (Expected Value) = (3000 Euros * 0.25) + (0 Euros * 0.75) = 750 Euros
- Variance = (0.25 * (3000 - 750)²) + (0.75 * (0 - 750)²) = (0.25 * 5062500) + (0.75 * 562500) = 1265625 + 421875 = 1687500 Euros²

Now, we have the variances: 
- Variance of Lottery A = 7248000 Euros²
- Variance of Lottery B = 1687500 Euros²

Step 2: Apply the decision reason which states a preference for the lottery with smaller variance. 
Lottery B has a smaller variance (1687500 Euros²) compared to Lottery A (7248000 Euros²). Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assessing the relevant information for both lotteries:
- For Lottery A:
  - Expected value (EV) = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros
  - Variance (Var) = (0.45 * (6000 - 2700)^2) + (0.55 * (0 - 2700)^2)
                   = (0.45 * 10890000) + (0.55 * 7290000)
                   = 4894500 + 4009500
                   = 8904000

- For Lottery B:
  - Expected value (EV) = (3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros
  - Variance (Var) = (0.90 * (3000 - 2700)^2) + (0.10 * (0 - 2700)^2)
                   = (0.90 * 90000) + (0.10 * 7290000)
                   = 81000 + 729000
                   = 810000

The relevant data is summarized as follows:
- Variance of Lottery A = 8904000
- Variance of Lottery B = 810000

Step 2: Applying the decision reason:
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since the variance of Lottery B (810000) is smaller than that of Lottery A (8904000), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: First, calculate the expected values of both lotteries to gather relevant information. 

For Lottery A:
- Expected value (EV_A) = (6000 Euros * 0.001) + (0 Euros * 0.999) = 6 Euros

For Lottery B:
- Expected value (EV_B) = (3000 Euros * 0.002) + (0 Euros * 0.998) = 6 Euros

Since the expected values are the same, we need to calculate the variance.

The variance for a lottery is calculated as follows:
Variance = (probability of outcome 1 * (outcome 1 - expected value)^2) + (probability of outcome 2 * (outcome 2 - expected value)^2)

Calculating variance for Lottery A:
- Variance_A = (0.001 * (6000 - 6)^2) + (0.999 * (0 - 6)^2)
- Variance_A = (0.001 * 35964000) + (0.999 * 36)
- Variance_A = 35964 + 35.964 = 35999.964

Calculating variance for Lottery B:
- Variance_B = (0.002 * (3000 - 6)^2) + (0.998 * (0 - 6)^2)
- Variance_B = (0.002 * 8994000) + (0.998 * 36)
- Variance_B = 17988 + 35.928 = 17923.928

Next, comparing the variances we find:
Variance_A (35999.964) > Variance_B (17923.928).

Step 2: Since the decision reason specifies a preference for the lottery with the smaller variance, Lottery B is preferred due to its smaller variance.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. First, we calculate the expected outcomes for both lotteries A and B, but since the decision reason focuses on variance, we will derive that directly from their probabilities and outcomes without actually calculating the expected value.

2. For Lottery A:
   - The outcomes are -4000 Euros (with probability 0.8) and 0 Euros (with probability 0.2).
   - The mean (expected value) of Lottery A is calculated as follows:
     Expected value A = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros.
   - The variance is calculated using the probabilities and the squared differences from the mean:
     Variance A = (0.8 * (-4000 - (-3200))^2) + (0.2 * (0 - (-3200))^2)
                 = (0.8 * 800^2) + (0.2 * 3200^2)
                 = (0.8 * 640000) + (0.2 * 10240000) 
                 = 512000 + 2048000 
                 = 2560000 Euros^2.

3. For Lottery B:
   - The outcome is -3000 Euros (with probability 1).
   - Since there's only one outcome, the variance is 0:
     Variance B = 0.

4. Now we compare the variances of both lotteries:
   - Variance A = 2560000 Euros^2.
   - Variance B = 0 Euros^2.
   - Since variance B (0) is less than variance A (2560000), Lottery B has the smaller variance.

5. Applying the decision reason which prefers the lottery with the smaller variance, we conclude that the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries' variances. Lottery A has two outcomes: -4000 Euros (20% probability) and 0 Euros (80% probability). The expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows:
EV(A) = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros.

Next, we calculate the variance of Lottery A. The variance formula is:
Variance(A) = P(outcome1) * (outcome1 - EV(A))^2 + P(outcome2) * (outcome2 - EV(A))^2.
Plugging in the values:
Variance(A) = 0.20 * (-4000 + 800)^2 + 0.80 * (0 + 800)^2
= 0.20 * (-3200)^2 + 0.80 * (800)^2
= 0.20 * 10240000 + 0.80 * 640000
= 2048000 + 512000
= 2560000.

Now we calculate the variance of Lottery B. It has two outcomes: -3000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability).
EV(B) = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros.
Variance(B) = P(outcome1) * (outcome1 - EV(B))^2 + P(outcome2) * (outcome2 - EV(B))^2.
Variance(B) = 0.25 * (-3000 + 750)^2 + 0.75 * (0 + 750)^2
= 0.25 * (-2250)^2 + 0.75 * (750)^2
= 0.25 * 5062500 + 0.75 * 562500
= 1265625 + 421875
= 1687500.

Both variances are now calculated: Variance(A) = 2560000 and Variance(B) = 1687500. Since I have derived the relevant information from the lotteries, I will proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since Variance(B) = 1687500 is less than Variance(A) = 2560000, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Calculate the expected outcomes and variance for both lotteries. 

For Lottery A:
- Expected outcome = (-6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = -2700 Euros
- Variance calculation:
  - Mean = -2700 Euros
  - Variance = 0.45 * (-6000 - (-2700))^2 + 0.55 * (0 - (-2700))^2
  - Variance = 0.45 * (-3300)^2 + 0.55 * (2700)^2
  - Variance = 0.45 * 10890000 + 0.55 * 7290000 
  - Variance = 4885500 + 4009500 = 8895000 Euros^2

For Lottery B:
- Expected outcome = (-3000 Euros * 0.90) + (0 Euros * 0.10) = -2700 Euros
- Variance calculation:
  - Mean = -2700 Euros
  - Variance = 0.90 * (-3000 - (-2700))^2 + 0.10 * (0 - (-2700))^2
  - Variance = 0.90 * (-300)^2 + 0.10 * (2700)^2
  - Variance = 0.90 * 90000 + 0.10 * 7290000 
  - Variance = 81000 + 729000 = 810000 Euros^2

Relevant information: 
- Lottery A has a variance of 8895000 Euros^2
- Lottery B has a variance of 810000 Euros^2

Step 2: Apply the decision reason: the reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since 810000 < 8895000, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: To assess the variance of each lottery, we need to calculate the expected outcomes and variances first.

For Lottery A:
- The expected value (EV_A) is calculated as follows:
  EV_A = (-6000 Euros * 0.001) + (0 Euros * 0.999) = -6 Euros

- The variance (Var_A) can be calculated using the formula:
  Var_A = (probability of outcome) * (outcome - EV_A)^2
  Here, we calculate the variance considering both outcomes:
  Var_A = (0.001 * (-6000 - (-6))^2) + (0.999 * (0 - (-6))^2)
  Var_A = (0.001 * (-5994)^2) + (0.999 * (6)^2)
  Var_A = (0.001 * 35824836) + (0.999 * 36)
  Var_A = 35824.836 + 35.964 = 35860.8

For Lottery B:
- The expected value (EV_B) is:
  EV_B = (-3000 Euros * 0.002) + (0 Euros * 0.998) = -6 Euros

- The variance (Var_B) is:
  Var_B = (0.002 * (-3000 - (-6))^2) + (0.998 * (0 - (-6))^2)
  Var_B = (0.002 * (-2994)^2) + (0.998 * (6)^2)
  Var_B = (0.002 * 8964016) + (0.998 * 36)
  Var_B = 17928.032 + 35.928 = 17963.96

The variances for the lotteries are:
- Var_A = 35860.8
- Var_B = 17963.96

Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance, we will move to Step 2.

Step 2: Compare the variances of both lotteries:
Since Var_A (35860.8) is greater than Var_B (17963.96), according to the decision reason, we prefer Lottery B as it has the smaller variance.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries for variance. 
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros (with a probability of 0.5) and 0 Euros (with a probability of 0.5). The mean (expected value) is (0.5 * 1000) + (0.5 * 0) = 500 Euros. The variance is calculated as follows:
  Variance = [(1000 - 500)² * 0.5] + [(0 - 500)² * 0.5] 
           = [(500)² * 0.5] + [(-500)² * 0.5] 
           = [250000 * 0.5] + [250000 * 0.5] 
           = 125000 + 125000 
           = 250000 Euros².

- For Lottery B, the only outcome is 500 Euros (with a probability of 1). The mean is 500 Euros, and since there is no variance in outcomes, the variance is 0 Euros².
  
Summarizing relevant information:
- Variance of Lottery A: 250000 Euros²
- Variance of Lottery B: 0 Euros²

Step 2: Apply the decision reason's rule.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Comparing the variances:
- Lottery A has a variance of 250000 Euros², while Lottery B has a variance of 0 Euros².
- Since 0 Euros² (variance of Lottery B) is less than 250000 Euros² (variance of Lottery A), the reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

"STEPS: 
Step 1: First, we calculate the expected values and variances of both lotteries. 
- For Lottery A:
  - Outcomes: -1000 Euros (50% probability), 0 Euros (50% probability)
  - Expected value (E[A]) = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros
  - Variance (Var[A]) = E[A^2] - (E[A])^2
    - E[A^2] = (-1000^2 * 0.5) + (0^2 * 0.5) = 500000
    - Var[A] = 500000 - (-500)^2 = 500000 - 250000 = 250000

- For Lottery B:
  - Outcomes: -500 Euros (100% probability)
  - Expected value (E[B]) = -500 Euros
  - Variance (Var[B]) = E[B^2] - (E[B])^2
    - E[B^2] = (-500^2 * 1) = 250000
    - Var[B] = 250000 - (-500)^2 = 250000 - 250000 = 0

We find that Lottery A has a variance of 250000, while Lottery B has a variance of 0.

Step 2: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since Lottery B has a variance of 0, which is less than the variance of Lottery A (250000), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Step 1: Calculate the expected values for both lotteries to assess their outcomes. For Lottery A:
- Expected value (E_A) = (6000 Euros * 0.25) + (0 Euros * 0.75) = 1500 Euros.
For Lottery B:
- Expected value (E_B) = (4000 Euros * 0.25) + (2000 Euros * 0.25) + (0 Euros * 0.50) = 1000 Euros.

For Lottery A:
- Variance (Var_A) = E[(X - E_A)²] = (0.25 * (6000 - 1500)²) + (0.75 * (0 - 1500)²) 
                     = (0.25 * (4500)²) + (0.75 * (-1500)²)

                     = 5062500 + 1687500 
                     = 6750000.

For Lottery B:
- Variance (Var_B) = E[(X - E_B)²] = (0.25 * (4000 - 1000)²) + (0.25 * (2000 - 1000)²) + (0.50 * (0 - 1000)²)
                     = (0.25 * (3000)²) + (0.25 * (1000)²) + (0.50 * (-1000)²) 
                     = (0.25 * 9000000) + (0.25 * 1000000) + (0.50 * 1000000)

Step 1: Calculate the expected value (mean) and variance for both lotteries to determine which has the smaller variance. 

For Lottery A:
- Outcomes: -6000 Euros (25% probability), 0 Euros (75% probability)
- Expected value (E) = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros
- Variance (Var) = [(-6000 - E)^2 * 0.25] + [(0 - E)^2 * 0.75]

Step 1: 
To apply the decision reason, I need to calculate the variance for both lotteries based on their outcomes and probabilities.

For Lottery A:
- Outcomes: 5000 Euros (probability 0.001), 0 Euros (probability 0.999)
- Mean (Expected Value) of Lottery A = (5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 5 Euros
- Variance of Lottery A = (5000 - 5)² * 0.001 + (0 - 5)² * 0.999

For Lottery B:
- Outcomes: 5 Euros (probability 1.0)
- Mean (Expected Value) of Lottery B = 5 Euros 
- Variance of Lottery B = (5 - 5)² * 1.0 = 0

Now I have the variances:
- Variance of Lottery A = 24975
- Variance of Lottery B = 0

Step 2: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Here, Lottery B has a variance of 0, which is less than the variance of Lottery A (24975). Therefore, based on the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred.

Step 1: Determine the relevant information about the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities to assess the variance. 
For Lottery A: 
- Outcome 1: -5000 Euros with a probability of 0.1% (0.001)
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9% (0.999)

The expected value (EV) of Lottery A is calculated as:
EV(A) = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros.

To find the variance, we calculate the expected value of the squared outcomes:
EV(X^2) = (-5000)^2 * 0.001 + (0)^2 * 0.999 = 25000000 * 0.001 = 25000.

Now we can calculate the variance:
Var(A) = EV(X^2) - (EV(A))^2
Var(A) = 25000 - (-5)^2 = 25000 - 25 = 24975 Euros^2.

For Lottery B:
- Outcome: -5 Euros with a probability of 100% (1)
The expected value (EV) of Lottery B is:
EV(B) = (-5 * 1) = -5 Euros.

The expected value of the squared outcomes is:
EV(X^2) = (-5)^2 * 1 = 25.

Variance of Lottery B is:
Var(B) = EV(X^2) - (EV(B))^2
Var(B) = 25 - (-5)^2 = 25 - 25 = 0 Euros^2.

Step 2: Compare the variances of the two lotteries based on the decision reason's rule. 
Var(A) = 24975 Euros^2 and Var(B) = 0 Euros^2. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance, which is Lottery B (variance 0 is less than 24975).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: First, we calculate the expected value and variance for both lotteries.

For Lottery A:
- Outcomes: 3000 Euros (50% probability), -3000 Euros (50% probability).
- Expected value (E) = (0.5 * 3000) + (0.5 * -3000) = 0 Euros.

To calculate variance (Var) for Lottery A:
- Variance = P(outcome1) * (outcome1 - E)^2 + P(outcome2) * (outcome2 - E)^2
- Variance = (0.5 * (3000 - 0)^2) + (0.5 * (-3000 - 0)^2)
- Variance = (0.5 * 9000000) + (0.5 * 9000000) = 4500000 Euros².

For Lottery B:
- Outcome: 1500 Euros (100% probability).
- Expected value (E) = 1 * 1500 = 1500 Euros.
- Variance = 0 since there is no variability (only one outcome).

So, we have:
- Variance of Lottery A = 4500000 Euros²
- Variance of Lottery B = 0 Euros²

Now we can determine which lottery has the smaller variance.

Step 2: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since 0 (variance of Lottery B) is less than 4500000 (variance of Lottery A), the reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Calculate the expected outcomes for lotteries A and B.  
- For Lottery A: 
  Expected Value (EV_A) = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 1500 - 1500 = 0 Euros. 

Variance of Lottery A: 
- First, we calculate the squared deviations from the expected value:
   Variance_A = [(3000 - 0)^2 * 0.5] + [(-3000 - 0)^2 * 0.5] 
   = [3000^2 * 0.5] + [3000^2 * 0.5] 
   = (9000000 * 0.5) + (9000000 * 0.5) 
   = 9000000 Euros². 

- For Lottery B:
  Expected Value (EV_B) = 2000 Euros.

Variance of Lottery B: 
- Since there’s no variance in Lottery B (it's a sure gain), 
   Variance_B = 0 Euros².

Step 2: Compare the variances. 
- Variance_A = 9000000 Euros² 
- Variance_B = 0 Euros² 
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance, we compare: 
0 < 9000000, thus Lottery B, with lower variance, is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 
- Lottery A has outcomes of 3000 Euros (50% probability) and -3000 Euros (50% probability). 
- Lottery B has a certain outcome of 1000 Euros (100% probability). 

To calculate the variance, we need to determine the expected value (EV) for each lottery:

Expected value of Lottery A: 
EV_A = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 1500 - 1500 = 0 Euros.

Variance of Lottery A: 
Var_A = [(3000 - EV_A)² * 0.5] + [(-3000 - EV_A)² * 0.5]
= [(3000 - 0)² * 0.5] + [(-3000 - 0)² * 0.5]
= [9000000 * 0.5] + [9000000 * 0.5] 
= 4500000 + 4500000 
= 9000000 Euros².

Expected value of Lottery B: 
EV_B = 1000 Euros (since there's 100% probability).

Variance of Lottery B: 
Var_B = (1000 - EV_B)² * 1 
= (1000 - 1000)² * 1 
= 0 Euros².

Summary of relevant information:
- Variance of Lottery A: 9000000 Euros².
- Variance of Lottery B: 0 Euros².

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Since Lottery B has a variance of 0 Euros² and Lottery A has a variance of 9000000 Euros², we conclude that the decision reason prefers Lottery B over A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the variances of the lotteries. 
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, each with a probability of 50%. 
- The expected value (mean) of Lottery A can be calculated as: 
  \( E(A) = (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 \) Euros. 
- The variance of Lottery A is calculated as follows:
  \( Var(A) = (6000 - 0)^2 * 0.5 + (-6000 - 0)^2 * 0.5 = (6000^2 * 0.5) + (6000^2 * 0.5) = 6000^2 = 36000000 \).
  
- For Lottery B, there is only one outcome, 0 Euros, with 100% probability.
- The expected value (mean) of Lottery B is:
  \( E(B) = 0 \) Euros.
- The variance of Lottery B is:
  \( Var(B) = 0 \) (since there is no variability in the outcome).

The relevant information derived from the lotteries is:
- Variance of Lottery A: 36000000
- Variance of Lottery B: 0

Since the necessary information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem. 
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the smaller variance. Here, Lottery B has a variance of 0, while Lottery A has a variance of 36000000. 
Thus, Lottery B is preferred due to having a smaller variance.
