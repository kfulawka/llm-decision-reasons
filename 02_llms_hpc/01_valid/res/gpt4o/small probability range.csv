1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - Lottery A:
     - Minimum probability: 1%
     - Maximum probability: 66%

"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The decision reason requires calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery.
   - For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%. The difference between the maximum and minimum probability is \(67\% - 33\% = 34\%\).
   - For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%. The difference between the maximum and minimum probability is \(66\% - 34\% = 32\%\).
