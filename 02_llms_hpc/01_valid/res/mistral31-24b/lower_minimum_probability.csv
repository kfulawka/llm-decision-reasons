0,"each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability.STEPS:

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

   The decision reason requires identifying the minimum probability of each lottery. For each lottery, we can derive the minimum probability from the given probabilities of outcomes. Therefore, we can apply the decision reason strictly to this decision problem.

   - For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% (the probability of winning 0 Euros).
   - For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there is only one outcome).

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

   According to the decision reason, we prefer the lottery with the lower minimum probability. Comparing the minimum probabilities:

   - Lottery A has a minimum probability of 1%.
   - Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.

   Since 1% is lower than 100%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
