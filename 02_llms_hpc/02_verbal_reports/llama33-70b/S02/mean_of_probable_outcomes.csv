Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so the only outcome is always probable. 
- For Lottery B, the probable outcomes are 2400 Euros (with 66% probability) and 2500 Euros (with 33% probability), since both probabilities are higher than 33.33%. The 0 Euros outcome (with 1% probability) is not probable.
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 2400 Euros (with 100% probability).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (2400*0.66 + 2500*0.33) / (0.66 + 0.33) = (1584 + 825) / 1 = 2409 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 2400 Euros.
The decision reason prefers Lottery B because its average of probable outcomes (2409 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing (0 Euros) in Lottery B and the possibility of gaining a higher amount (implied by ""die möglichen 100€"", which seems to be a misunderstanding since the actual higher amount is 2500 Euros, not an additional 100 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery B because the probability of losing is very low and the possibility of gaining more is not entirely unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities, while the individual considered the low probability of losing and the possibility of gaining more, but without explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which is Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but based on a different rationale that doesn’t explicitly involve calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined, but the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest. However, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason’s criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
For Lottery A, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. However, given that the only probable outcome for both is 0 Euros, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. But to apply the decision reason correctly, we should note that it prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome, the decision reason, as described, does not differentiate between them based on the provided probabilities and outcomes. However, this step indicates that the decision reason can technically be applied but may not yield a clear preference based on the given criteria.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (100 Euros) between the two lotteries and the difference in probabilities (1 percentage point).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risky option), suggesting they preferred the lottery with a potentially higher reward despite the slightly lower probability of winning, because the differences in both reward and probability were not large.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on the given probabilities, would be the same for both lotteries (0 Euros). The individual, however, considered the differences in potential winnings and probabilities, not explicitly the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would not prefer one lottery over the other based on the probable outcomes since both have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual, however, chose based on the perceived risk and the difference in potential winnings, not directly because of the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries in this case, whereas the individual's choice was based on the perceived risk and the differences in potential winnings and probabilities. This suggests that the individual did not use the specified decision reason to make their decision."
3,"bei Lotterie B (auch da es sich um relativ hohe Summen handelt -> besser haben als Spielen)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (3000 Euros), so its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 = 1, making it a probable outcome. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes (4000 Euros and 0 Euros), so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. The outcome of 4000 Euros has an 80% probability, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 0 Euros has a 20% probability, which is lower than 0.5, so it is not considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of security (Sicherheitsbedürfnis) and the risk associated with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially given the high sums involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on a desire for security and not wanting to gamble with the 20% risk of not winning, indicating a preference for a certain outcome over a risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating probabilities and outcomes. The individual, however, focused on security and the risk of not winning, which does not directly involve calculating averages of probable outcomes but does indicate a consideration of the probabilities (especially the 20% risk).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, Lottery B has a higher average of probable outcomes (4000 Euros) than Lottery A (3000 Euros). However, the individual's justification is based on security and avoiding risk, not explicitly on comparing the averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on security and risk avoidance does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the averages of probable outcomes. While the individual does consider the probabilities (notably the 20% risk in Lottery B), the justification provided does not indicate a calculation or comparison of average probable outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. For both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros because the only probable outcome for each is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B and notes that the probability difference of 5% between the two lotteries does not seem significant. This indicates the individual considered the potential gains and the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be drawn to Lottery B because of its potential for a higher gain, despite acknowledging a relatively small probability difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the potential higher gain and the probability difference, not explicitly mentioning the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would not prefer one lottery over the other based on the average of probable outcomes since both averages are 0. The individual, however, seems to prefer Lottery B based on its higher potential gain, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the potential higher gain and the perceived insignificant probability difference does not align with the decision reason's criteria of comparing the average of probable outcomes. Given that both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros) and the individual's justification does not reflect the decision reason's rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, so it is not considered probable. The outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome.
Thus, the probable outcomes are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher average of probable outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual found the 90% probability of winning in Lottery A very appealing and was deterred by the less than 50% probability in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of winning was very appealing, and the low probability of winning in Lottery B was unappealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes based on a probability threshold of 50%, which aligns with the individual’s concern about the probabilities (especially the less than 50% chance in Lottery B being a deterrent).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case is Lottery A due to its 3000 Euros outcome being probable. The individual’s justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A, based on the appeal of its high probability of winning.

Given these comparisons, the individual’s consideration of the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the deterrent effect of the low probability in Lottery B suggests alignment with the decision reason’s focus on probable outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual’s reasoning seems to intuitively align with the decision reason but does not perfectly match the step-by-step analysis required by the reason.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5. 
Thus, for both lotteries, only the 0 Euro outcome is considered probable. 
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and the average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is also 0 Euros. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries and had the feeling that it is relatively indifferent between the two options, which led them to choose the higher potential gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by the feeling of indifference due to the low winning probability, which made them prefer the lottery with the higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, are the same for both lotteries (0 Euros). However, the individual's consideration was more about the overall low probability of winning and the indifference it created, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the higher potential gain due to feeling indifferent about the low probabilities, not directly applying the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described, but their choice was influenced by the perception of low probabilities, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision was influenced by the perception of low probabilities, which is related to the concept of probable outcomes, they did not explicitly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes to make their choice. The individual's focus was more on the indifference caused by low winning probabilities and the preference for the higher potential gain, rather than on calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes as specified by the decision reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always probable since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: -4000 Euros with 80% probability, since 80% is higher than 50%.
- Lottery A has one probable outcome: -3000 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is -4000 Euros (since there's only one probable outcome), and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros. 
Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a higher average of probable outcomes (-3000 Euros vs. -4000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the definitive loss of Lottery A and the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B, comparing these to the difference in potential losses between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the attractiveness of avoiding a loss (in the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B) against the additional potential loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A, indicating that the additional 1000 Euros loss in Lottery B was not worth the gamble for the 20% chance of no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating or considering the outcomes with probabilities higher than a certain threshold. The individual discusses the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages or focusing solely on probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual's justification implies a comparison of risks and potential losses but does not explicitly state a preference based on the average of probable outcomes. However, the individual's decision to prefer Lottery A (implied by the discussion of not finding the additional potential loss in B worth the gamble) aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, but the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on a more general comparison of risks and losses. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not explicitly match the criteria of focusing on the average of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but based on the information provided, it seems more likely that it was not used as the primary reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 80% probability, since 80% is greater than 50%. The outcome of -4000 Euros with 20% probability is not considered probable. For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 75% probability, as 75% is greater than 50%. The outcome of -3000 Euros with 25% probability is not considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both averages are 0, the reason would be indifferent based on the probable outcomes alone.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential losses (5% difference in probabilities and the amounts of -4000 Euros vs. -3000 Euros) and the impact of these differences on their decision. They mention uncertainty about how much the 5% difference in probabilities would influence their choice but were swayed by the ""smaller loss sum"" and the significant psychological impact of the larger loss (-4000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B seems to be based on the smaller potential loss (-3000 Euros vs. -4000 Euros) and the psychological factor of the larger loss being ""erschreckend viel"" (very frightening).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual, however, focused on the potential losses and their probabilities, considering both the numerical difference and the psychological impact, not strictly on the probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule would lead to indifference between the two lotteries based on probable outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on minimizing loss and psychological factors, not the average of probable outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. So, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome ""-6000 Euros"" has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome ""0 Euros"" has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is ""0 Euros"".
For Lottery B, the outcome ""-3000 Euros"" has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome ""0 Euros"" has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is ""-3000 Euros"".
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is -3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the outcomes, considered the higher loss in Lottery A but also its lower probability compared to the loss in Lottery B, and noted the high probability of the loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after considering the probabilities and the fact that the probability of the loss in Lottery A is ""under 50%"".

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes based on their probabilities being higher than 50%, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probabilities and the mention of the probability being ""under 50%"" for Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the comparative probabilities and the absolute levels of loss rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on probabilities and the threshold of 50% aligns somewhat with the decision reason's criteria for identifying probable outcomes. However, the decision reason's core principle of comparing the average of probable outcomes is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual's justification seems to lean more towards a comparison of the loss amounts and their respective probabilities rather than calculating averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in considering probabilities, the core application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Here, only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (99.9%) is higher than 0.5.
For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. Similarly, only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros, as only the 0 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable in both cases.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as frightening and notes that the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries is minimal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the fear of the larger loss in Lottery A and the minimal difference in probabilities, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the 0 Euros outcome for both lotteries, since only this outcome is probable. The individual, however, focuses on the fear of loss and the minimal probability difference, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which, based on the calculation, would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing averages of probable outcomes but rather reacts to the potential loss and probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Instead, the focus was on the fear of loss and the minimal difference in probabilities, suggesting that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Thus, the 1000 Euros outcome and the 0 Euros outcome are both probable since they both have a 50% probability. For Lottery B, there is only one outcome (500 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their respective probabilities. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (1000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the average of the probable outcome is 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to focus on the attractiveness of getting ""sicher Geld"" (safe money), implying consideration of the certainty of outcomes. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the appeal of receiving a guaranteed amount, suggesting risk aversion, especially given that the additional potential gain did not increase their willingness to take risks.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in both cases is 500 Euros. The individual, however, emphasizes the guarantee of receiving money, which aligns with considering the certainty of outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since both have the same average of probable outcomes (500 Euros). The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference for the guaranteed outcome (Lottery B), which could align with the decision reason's outcome if the individual implicitly considered the attractiveness of a guaranteed 500 Euros over a risky 1000 Euros or 0 Euros. However, the explicit reasoning provided does not directly match the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the guarantee of receiving money and risk aversion does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of comparing the averages of probable outcomes. While the decision might coincidentally align with what the decision reason would suggest (given the specific lotteries), the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual used the decision reason as described. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but there is a small possibility that the individual's thought process indirectly involved considerations similar to the decision reason, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable since their probabilities are exactly 0.5, which meets the criteria for being considered probable in a two-outcome scenario.
- Lottery A has one outcome: -500 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -500 Euros. 
Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional balance, possibly leading to a more risk-seeking choice (Variante B). They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the certainty of the loss in Lottery A and possibly by factors outside the lotteries themselves (like current balance and the psychological impact of additional funds). They do not explicitly discuss the average of probable outcomes or directly compare the lotteries based on the decision reason provided.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which was calculated as -500 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the certainty of loss and external factors rather than the average outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average (-500 Euros), the decision reason would suggest indifference. The individual’s justification does not explicitly mention comparing averages of outcomes or applying a rule based on the probability and value of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the average of probable outcomes or applied a decision rule based on this criterion. Their justification for the choice focuses on different aspects (certainty of loss, influence of additional funds), suggesting that the decision reason provided was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery based on the decision reason's criteria. An outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1 divided by the number of outcomes for that lottery.
- For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome with 75% probability is considered probable.
- For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Thus, the 0 Euros outcome with 50% probability is considered probable.

The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery.
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is also 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome meets the criteria for being probable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's consideration focuses on the desire to win something positive and notes that the probability of winning something with Lottery B is higher, even though the wins are lower than with Lottery A. The justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the higher probability of winning any amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (average of probable outcomes) with what the individual considered (probability of winning something), it seems the individual did not directly consider the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Instead, they considered the overall probability of winning any positive amount, which is not exactly what the decision reason specifies.
The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have an average of probable outcomes of 0 Euros, the reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on the provided probabilities and outcomes. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (higher probability of winning something), not directly aligning with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 75% probability because it exceeds the 50% threshold.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability because it exceeds the 33.33% threshold.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome meets the probability threshold).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions difficulty with decisions involving losses, the high value of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, and the higher probability of any loss occurring in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be deterred by the high potential loss in Lottery A and acknowledges the higher likelihood of any loss in Lottery B but does not explicitly state how these considerations led to their choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold for each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the difficulty with losses, the high value of a potential gain, and the probability of losses, which does not directly align with the specific calculation of averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have an average of probable outcomes as 0 Euros based on the decision reason's criteria, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The individual's justification, however, does not clearly indicate a consideration of the average probable outcomes or a direct comparison based on this rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on the perceived difficulty of dealing with losses, the attractiveness of the high-value outcome in Lottery A, and the comparative likelihoods of losses in each lottery, rather than explicitly considering the average of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to identify the probable outcomes for each lottery based on the given probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcome of 5000 Euros has a 0.1% probability, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 99.9% probability. Since Lottery B has two outcomes, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is probable for Lottery B. For Lottery A, the outcome of 5 Euros has a 100% probability, making it a probable outcome since 1 is greater than 1/1 = 1. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B and compared it to the certain but smaller gain in Lottery A. They also mentioned the potential loss (or rather, the lack of gain) associated with choosing Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the probability of the large gain in Lottery B was too small to be enticing, implying they were not sufficiently attracted to the riskier option despite its potential for a larger reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which requires identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than a certain threshold. The individual discussed the small probability of the large gain in Lottery B and the certainty of the small gain in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification implies a preference for the certain gain over the highly uncertain large gain, which could align with preferring a higher average of probable outcomes if we consider that the individual implicitly recognized the 5 Euros in Lottery A as a certain (and thus probable) outcome and the 0 Euros in Lottery B as the probable outcome due to its high probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual seems to have considered the essence of the decision reason (focusing on the probabilistic nature of the outcomes and their attractiveness) but did not explicitly apply the rule of calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes. However, their justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B can be seen as consistent with the decision reason's preference for a higher average of probable outcomes, given the implicit recognition of probable outcomes based on their probabilities.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). The outcomes are -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. Since 99.9% is higher than 0.5, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, there is one outcome, -5 Euros with 100% probability, which is considered probable since 100% is higher than 1 (1/1). The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the low probability of loss in Lottery B and the certain but small loss in Lottery A. Second, the individual justifies the choice by comparing the enormity of the potential loss in Lottery B to the small, certain loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the certain loss in Lottery A seems irrelevant in comparison to the potential, though highly unlikely, large loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (low probability of a large loss in Lottery B vs. a small certain loss in Lottery A), it appears the individual focuses on the comparison of outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification (comparing the magnitude of potential losses without explicit calculation of averages), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual seems to weigh the certainty and magnitude of losses rather than calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (comparing outcomes), the specific rule of calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes is not clearly followed in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the comparison of the certainty and magnitude of potential losses rather than on calculating averages, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make their choice between Lottery A and Lottery B, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is only one outcome, so its probability is 100%, which is considered probable. 
- Lottery A: Both outcomes (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros) have a 50% probability, making both probable according to the reason's criteria since 50% is exactly the threshold of 1/2.
- Lottery B: The outcome (1500 Euros) has a 100% probability, making it probable.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the average is (3000 Euros - 3000 Euros) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is simply 1500 Euros because there is only one outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring a smaller gain to avoid a 50% loss, indicating they considered the risk of losing in Lottery A and the certainty of gaining in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on risk aversion, specifically preferring the certainty of a smaller gain over the risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 1500 Euros. The individual seems to focus on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention averaging them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a preference for the higher average of probable outcomes, does indicate a preference for avoiding risk, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it offers a certain gain over the risky outcomes of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment indicates that while the individual's verbal report does not directly state that they used the decision reason of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, their focus on avoiding a significant loss and preferring a certain gain suggests that their decision-making process aligns with the principles of the decision reason, though not in a perfectly explicit manner."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so its single outcome is always considered probable. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Both are probable since their probabilities are exactly 50%, meeting the criteria for being considered.
- Lottery B has one outcome: 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which is clearly probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is simply 2000 Euros since there's only one outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the appeal of a definitive win, especially after many loss decisions in previous rounds, indicating a consideration of risk and the attractiveness of a certain gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to hinge on the desire to avoid more risk, given past experiences, suggesting that the certainty of a gain (in this case, 2000 Euros from Lottery B) is preferred over the riskier option (Lottery A), even if the potential gain is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, while the individual seems to focus on the risk aspect and the appeal of a certain gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but doesn't directly mention calculating averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (2000 Euros) over Lottery A (0 Euros average). The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a calculation of averages, implies a preference for the certain gain offered by Lottery B due to risk aversion, especially after previous losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not directly mention calculating the average of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates, their choice and justification (preferring the certain gain due to risk aversion) align with the outcome the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B over Lottery A). However, the process described in the verbal report does not explicitly match the step-by-step analysis the decision reason would entail, leading to a moderate level of certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, making both outcomes technically not probable by a strict interpretation since they exactly meet but do not exceed the 50% threshold. However, for practical purposes, we might consider them as being on the boundary. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so any outcome with a probability greater than 0% is considered probable. Thus, the 1000 Euros outcome is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, if we consider the outcomes as probable due to their 50% probability, the average would be (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros. If we strictly apply the rule and do not consider them probable, the average of probable outcomes for Lottery B would be undefined or considered as 0 since no outcome meets the criteria of being probable. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information for Lottery A is 1000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it could be considered as 0 Euros under a strict interpretation of the rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain from Lottery A compared to the potential loss from Lottery B, noting the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the certain gain of Lottery A to the risky, potentially higher loss of Lottery B, emphasizing the unattractiveness of the possible loss in B despite its potential higher gain, especially given the 50% probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on our analysis, would favor Lottery A due to its certain outcome. The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain in A versus the potential loss in B, focusing on the probabilities and outcomes but not explicitly calculating or mentioning an average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery A but is based on a comparison of the certain gain versus the risky outcome, rather than an explicit calculation of average probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. However, the individual's focus on the certain gain of Lottery A over the risky outcomes of Lottery B, considering probabilities, aligns with the overall preference indicated by the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its certain, positive outcome). The assessment is not a perfect match because the individual's reasoning process described does not directly apply the rule of averaging probable outcomes but leads to a similar conclusion. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's not a clear, direct application of the decision reason, leading to an assessment above the midpoint but not at certainty."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery B (6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability) have probabilities of exactly 0.5, which does not exceed the threshold but exactly meets it; however, given the context, it seems reasonable to consider both outcomes as they are exactly at the threshold and the decision reason's application might depend on how strictly the ""higher than"" criterion is interpreted. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), which clearly meets the criterion since 1 > 1/1 = 1 is not applicable in the usual sense but 100% probability implies it's the only outcome and thus probable by default. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their calculation of average for each lottery.

For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes, if we consider both due to their exact threshold meeting, would be (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is simply 0 Euros, as it's the only outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be considering the magnitude of the potential win/loss in Lottery B (mentioning ""6000 zu große Summe,"" indicating that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk) and the concept of taking a break or pause (""einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung""), which might imply a preference for avoiding risk or a desire to not engage with the high-stakes gamble.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification, as described, focuses on the high risk associated with Lottery B and seems to imply a preference for avoiding this risk, possibly leaning towards the safety of Lottery A (implied by the mention of taking a break being acceptable, which could mean opting out of the gamble).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the average of probable outcomes for each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the risk associated with the large sum in Lottery B. However, both involve considering the outcomes of the lotteries, albeit in different manners.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which, based on the calculation, would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both average to 0 Euros when considering the probable outcomes as defined. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes risk aversion rather than directly comparing averages of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about averaging probable outcomes. The verbal report indicates a risk-averse approach rather than a calculation-based preference for one lottery over the other based on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as defined, was used by the individual, given the focus on risk aversion in the verbal report rather than the specific calculation and comparison of probable outcomes' averages. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does consider the outcomes of the lotteries, albeit in a manner different from the decision reason."
