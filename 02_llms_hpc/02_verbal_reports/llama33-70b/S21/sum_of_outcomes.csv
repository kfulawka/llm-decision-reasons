Verbal report:
Ich habe mich für A entschieden, da hier wieder keine Verluste möglich sind und ich daher den Weg mit der insgesamt betrachteten höheren Auszahlung einschlagen würde.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""keine Verluste möglich sind"" (no losses possible) and the ""insgesamt betrachteten höheren Auszahlung"" (higher overall payout).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has no losses and a higher overall payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the ""insgesamt betrachteten höheren Auszahlung"" (higher overall payout).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which matches the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A due to its higher overall payout.

Considering these comparisons, it appears that the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason, as they both focus on the overall or total outcome of the lotteries, even though the individual also mentions the aspect of no losses, which is not a part of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2400 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the sum is 2500 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (2500 Euros vs. 2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting they are approximately equal, and the potential winnings, acknowledging that Lottery B offers a higher reward. The individual also considered the absence of possible losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite similar probabilities, it offers a higher potential gain if won, and there are no losses involved.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, considered not just the potential winnings but also the probabilities and the absence of losses. Thus, the individual's consideration includes but is not limited to the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B mentions the higher potential gain (which aligns with the decision reason) but also mentions the similarity in probabilities and the absence of losses, which are not part of the decision reason.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's decision process includes elements that align with the decision reason (preferring the higher outcome) but also includes additional considerations (probabilities, absence of losses). However, the core aspect of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) is present in the individual's justification, suggesting that the decision reason may have played a role in the decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60"
3,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 Euros + 0 Euros = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated and compared, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery: 4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of each lottery, the probability of not winning in Lottery A (20%), and the fact that Lottery B offers a sure but smaller gain compared to the potential gain of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential gain, if achieved, is higher than in Lottery B, despite acknowledging the risk of winning nothing. The individual weighed the higher potential reward against the lower but guaranteed reward of Lottery B and chose the riskier option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the basis for the decision. The individual considered the potential gains and the risk, not just the sum of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher gain and the willingness to accept risk for that potential, not explicitly on comparing the sums of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the sum of its outcomes. The individual considered probabilities and the attractiveness of potential gains in a risk context, rather than just the sum of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that in both lotteries, no loss can be incurred, the probabilities do not differ strongly, and the potential gain in Lottery A is higher. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential gain is higher and the probabilities do not differ significantly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (no loss, probability difference, and higher gain in A): The individual considered the higher gain in Lottery A but did not explicitly mention calculating the sum of outcomes for each lottery. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher gain and similar probabilities): The individual's justification is partially aligned with the decision reason, as they chose the lottery with the higher gain, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the sum of outcomes or using this as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery A due to its higher potential gain), but the verbal report lacks explicit mention of considering the sum of all outcomes for each lottery as the basis for the decision, which is the core of the decision reason. Thus, while there is some alignment, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly applied. The assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used as the primary basis for the decision, given the information provided in the verbal report."
5,"the lottery with the higher outcome sum.

Verbal report:
Ich habe mich für A entschieden, da hier wieder keine Verluste möglich sind und ich daher den risikoreicheren Weg, jedoch mit einer höheren Auszahlung einschalgen würde.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. Since 6000 Euros is greater than 3000 Euros, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that ""keine Verluste möglich sind"" (no losses are possible), which implies they considered the aspect of not losing money in both lotteries since both have a 0 Euro outcome. However, this does not directly relate to the sum of outcomes as considered by the decision reason. The individual also mentions ""den risikoreicheren Weg, jedoch mit einer höheren Auszahlung"" (the riskier path, however with a higher payout), indicating they considered the risk and potential payout.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to focus on the absence of losses and the potential for a higher payout in Lottery A, despite acknowledging it as the ""risikoreicheren Weg"" (riskier path).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason relies on the sum of outcomes (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the absence of losses and the riskier path with a higher payout.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which is Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A but justified it based on the potential for a higher payout and the absence of losses, not explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes. The individual's reasoning seems more aligned with risk assessment and potential payout rather than the simple sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly support the application of the decision reason's rule regarding the sum of outcomes. However, it is not a certainty (0) because the choice made by the individual aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, even if the justification does not perfectly match the decision reason's criteria."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. Since 6000 Euros (Lottery B) is greater than 3000 Euros (Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the monetary outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""keine Verluste möglich sind"" (no losses possible) and the higher payout of one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a higher payout, despite being somewhat uncertain, and no losses are possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of the outcomes, but the individual's reasoning seems to focus more on the absence of losses and the higher potential payout, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual's choice of Lottery B. However, the justification provided by the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the sums of outcomes or considering the outcomes independently of their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the specific decision reason of comparing the sum of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. While the individual chose Lottery B, which aligns with the preference of the decision reason, their justification is based on different criteria (absence of losses and higher payout). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the basis for the individual's choice, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment in the choice outcome."
7,"zugen, sondern den sicheren Weg gehen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss associated with each lottery and the probability of the loss in Lottery B. They compared the certain loss in Lottery A with the potential higher loss in Lottery B, taking into account that the higher loss in B is not certain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the loss is smaller and certain, as opposed to the potentially higher loss in Lottery B, even though the higher loss in B is not certain. The individual preferred the certain outcome over the risky one due to the magnitude of the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of the magnitude of losses and their probabilities. The individual did not mention summing the outcomes of the lotteries as part of their deliberation.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A in this case since -3000 is greater than -4000. However, the individual's justification is based on the preference for a certain, smaller loss over a potential, larger loss, not on summing the outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual considered the certainty and magnitude of losses rather than the sum of all outcomes of the lotteries.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these sums, which indicates that Lottery B has a higher outcome sum (-3000 > -4000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the possibility of losses in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the smaller loss, implying they focused on minimizing the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, while the individual considered probabilities and the magnitude of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative in this case), which aligns with choosing the lottery with the smaller loss (since -3000 is less negative than -4000). The individual’s justification for choosing the lottery with the smaller loss indirectly aligns with the rule of the decision reason, as both lead to the preference of Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment is based on the alignment between the decision reason's preference for the less negative sum (which would be Lottery B) and the individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the smaller loss, also leading to the selection of Lottery B. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's reasoning explicitly mentions probabilities and minimizing loss, not the sum of outcomes as the decision reason does. The alignment in the final choice but difference in the reasoning process leads to a high but not perfect certainty that the decision reason was used."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss (receiving 0 Euros) and the magnitude of the potential loss in each lottery.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of receiving 0 Euros is higher than in Lottery B, and the magnitude of the potential loss in Lottery A is perceived as less significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probability of receiving 0 Euros and magnitude of potential loss). The information considered by the individual does not directly align with the decision reason, which focuses solely on the sum of outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (based on probability and perceived loss magnitude). The individual’s justification does not match the decision reason’s rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher outcome sum (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A based on different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification and considered information do not align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but does not contribute to the sum in a way that changes it from the other outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum than Lottery B when considering the negative outcomes in isolation without their probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of both lotteries to be roughly equal and the height of the loss in Lottery B to be twice as high as in Lottery A. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the comparison of the loss heights between the two lotteries, given similar probabilities, and not on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the height of the loss), we find that the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery A because the loss is not twice as high as in Lottery B, given similar probabilities), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 1000 Euros + 0 Euros = 1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 500 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated and compared, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery B has a higher outcome sum (1000 Euros) than Lottery A (500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of ""no losses"" in Lottery B, implying they looked at the possible outcomes (1000 Euros or 0 Euros) and their implications (no loss but a potential high gain). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""riskier path"" where the potential gain is higher, indicating they were attracted to the higher possible gain in Lottery B compared to the certain but lower gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual's considerations were more about the absence of losses and the potential for a higher gain, not explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual preferred Lottery B because of its potential for a higher gain and the absence of losses, not explicitly because of the sum of its outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of outcomes. While both lead to a preference for Lottery B, the individual's justification is based on different criteria (potential for higher gain and absence of losses), indicating the decision reason was likely not used. However, since the outcome aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, there is a small possibility of overlap in reasoning, but it's not directly evident from the verbal report."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -1000 + 0 = -1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance to win 0 Euros in Lottery B and the certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance to win 0 Euros, whereas Lottery A results in a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (chance to win 0 Euros and certain loss): The individual's considerations do not directly relate to the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chance to win 0 Euros): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual focused on the possibility of not losing anything, rather than comparing the total sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason was not used by the individual, as the verbal report does not mention or imply consideration of the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the individual's decision was based on the presence of a zero-loss outcome in one of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros (4000 + 2000 + 0), and for Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros (6000 + 0). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 6000 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of achieving a gain in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B only offers a gain with a 25% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, in their view, the probability of achieving a gain is higher in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of the outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual discusses the probability of achieving a gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum (6000 Euros), it would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of gaining, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. The individual's decision is based on the perceived higher probability of achieving a gain in Lottery A, not on the sum of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -6000 Euros (-4000 + -2000 + 0). For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros (-6000 + 0). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A if its outcome sum is higher, prefers Lottery B if its outcome sum is higher, or is indifferent if the sums are equal. Since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of obtaining 0 Euros in each lottery and the overall probability of incurring a loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher probability of yielding 0 Euros, and they chose against Lottery A because it has a higher overall probability of resulting in a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, while the individual considered probabilities and the likelihood of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference due to equal outcome sums, but the individual's justification is based on probabilities and loss avoidance, not the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification and considered information do not align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 5000 Euros (since 5000 + 0 = 5000), and for Lottery B, the sum is 5 Euros. The information relevant to this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A to be nearly zero, which made it seem unrealistic, and they preferred the sure payout of Lottery B because it guarantees a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived realism of winning in Lottery A due to its low probability and the preference for a guaranteed payout in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focuses on the probability of winning and the guarantee of a payout.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A (5000 Euros vs. 5 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on the guarantee of a payout, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of probabilities, which is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice is based on the perceived realism of the probabilities and the preference for a guaranteed payout. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -5000 Euros + 0 Euros = -5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -5 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of earning 0 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because of the high probability of not losing anything (earning 0 Euros) and viewed the certain loss in Lottery B as undesirable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-5000 Euros for A and -5 Euros for B), which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities and the certainty of outcomes, not the sum of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B since -5 Euros is greater than -5000 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of earning 0 Euros and the undesirability of a certain loss, not on comparing the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 1500 Euros. Since the sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery B and 1500 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the equal chance of loss or gain in Lottery B and the certainty of gain in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to Lottery B, which has an equal chance of a loss or gain of the same amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the equal chance of loss or gain in Lottery B, rather than the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, not explicitly on the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, was used to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the certainty of gain and the risk of loss, rather than the sum of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2000 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum (2000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in possible gains between the two lotteries (a difference of 1000 Euros), the certainty of the gain in Lottery A, and the risk of a high loss in Lottery B with the same probability as the gain.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential gains are close, but the certainty of the gain in A and the risk of a significant loss in B were decisive factors.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (difference in gains, certainty, and risk of loss), we see that the individual did not explicitly mention calculating or considering the sum of all outcomes of each lottery as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the certainty of gain and the risk of loss), we observe that the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision seems to be more influenced by the certainty of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. The focus on certainty and risk in the verbal report suggests a different decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A, the higher potential gain in Lottery A, the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, and the lower but guaranteed payout in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential higher gain in Lottery A against the lower but certain gain in Lottery B, ultimately choosing the certain outcome due to its guaranteed nature.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes of each lottery, independent of probabilities. The individual, however, considered both the outcomes and their probabilities, as well as the certainty of one of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case (since 1000 Euros is greater than 0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, was based on the preference for a certain gain over a riskier option with potentially higher reward, not solely on the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and the comparison of potential gains versus risks indicates that they did not use the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros - 6000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since both have the same outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the equal probabilities of winning or losing in Lottery A and the certainty of not winning or losing in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way), implying a preference for avoiding the risk of loss present in Lottery A, even if it means forgoing the possibility of a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and risk). The individual's focus was on the probabilities and the risk associated with each lottery, not on the sum of the outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the safe option to avoid loss). The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries, whereas the individual clearly preferred Lottery B due to its risk-free nature, not because of the sum of its outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on the risk associated with each lottery and the preference for a safe option, which does not align with the decision reason that considers the sum of outcomes independent of their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
