STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (for winning 2400 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 2400 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Thus, the relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: 66% (maximum probability)
- Lottery B: 100% (maximum probability)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 33% chance of winning more in Lottery A than in Lottery B and the risk of winning nothing, which they deemed very low.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential higher gain against the minimal risk of losing, finding the risk acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the chance of winning more and the risk of winning nothing. The individual's focus does not directly align with comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (100%). However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries but rather weighs potential gains against perceived risks.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability. The individual's focus on potential gains and the risk of winning nothing, rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a 34% probability of winning 2400 Euros, and Lottery B has a 33% probability of winning 2500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 34% (for 2400 Euros)
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 33% (for 2500 Euros)
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions that the probability of winning in both lotteries is very similar and that the potential gain is also similarly high. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities and the potential winnings of both lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual decided based on the potentially higher gain, implying they chose the lottery with the higher potential winnings, which is Lottery B with 2500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's report emphasizes the similarity in probabilities and the decision based on the potential gain, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of the maximum probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (34% vs 33%). However, the individual's justification is based on the potential higher gain (2500 Euros vs 2400 Euros), which led them to choose Lottery B, not because of its probability but because of its higher potential payout.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. Instead, their choice was influenced by the potential gain.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (for winning 4000 Euros), and for Lottery A, it's 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros versus the risk of potentially gaining nothing (20% probability) with Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized having 3000 Euros with certainty over taking the risk associated with Lottery B, which implies a focus on avoiding the risk of not winning anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain vs. risk of no gain): The individual's consideration indirectly touches upon the concept of probability (certainty vs. risk), but it does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (prioritizing certainty over risk): The individual's justification aligns with preferring a higher probability of gain (100% certainty of 3000 Euros over an 80% chance of 4000 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason's rule, even though the individual does not explicitly state it in terms of maximum probability comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
The individual's verbal report suggests an implicit consideration of probabilities and a preference for certainty, which aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. However, the report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities, leading to a high but not complete certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 80% (also for 0 Euros). However, since the reason is about the maximum probability of a win, we consider the probabilities associated with the winnings: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, specifically the probabilities of winning (25% for A and 20% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of the lotteries. The individual mentions looking at the probabilities (""Wahrscheinlichkeiten angeschaut"").
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on preferring a higher probability for a win (""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Gewinn"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of winning) with that considered by the individual (probabilities in general), there's a match in the focus on probabilities, but the decision reason specifically looks at the maximum probability of a win, which aligns with the individual's stated preference for a ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Gewinn"" (higher probability for a win).
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning) to the individual's justification (preferring a higher probability for a win), there's a clear alignment. The individual's justification directly reflects the decision reason's rule, focusing on the higher probability of a win as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason provided, indicating a clear focus on the probability of winning as the basis for the decision, which matches the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 45% (for winning 6000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of winning in each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, mentioning that the probability of winning is higher in Lottery A.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by stating that the probability of winning is higher and also mentioned that they had already taken a risk in the two previous rounds.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of winning in each lottery, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the higher probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery A in this case, because it has a 90% probability of winning. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A mentions the higher probability of winning, which aligns with the rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report indicates that they considered the higher probability of winning in Lottery A as the main reason for their choice, which directly aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of winning in each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 0.2% (the probability of winning 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 0.1% (the probability of winning 6000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities. Since both lotteries have different maximum probabilities of winning, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A to be higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning something is higher in this lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of winning) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning something): The individual's consideration aligns with the information required by the decision reason, focusing on the probability aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing Lottery A because it has a higher probability of winning): The individual's justification matches the decision reason's rule, as both prioritize the lottery with the higher probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
This assessment is based on the alignment between the decision reason's criteria (maximum probability of winning) and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (higher probability of winning something), indicating that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (for losing -4000 Euros), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for losing -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the aspect of having a chance to not lose money in one of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual preferred participating in the lottery where there's a chance to not lose money, implying a preference for Lottery B because it offers a 20% chance of losing 0 Euros, as opposed to Lottery A, where the loss is certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the aspect of not losing money), it appears the individual focused more on the presence of a zero-loss outcome rather than directly comparing maximum probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring the chance to not lose money), it seems the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its 100% probability, which is higher than any probability in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on having a chance to not lose money and their preference for Lottery B based on this criterion do not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, indicating they looked at the probabilities several times. They also mention considering the ""potentiell geringeren Verlust,"" which translates to ""potentially smaller loss.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on choosing the option with the potentially smaller loss, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities, while the individual considered probabilities but emphasized the potential loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery based on the potentially smaller loss, not explicitly the higher probability of a better outcome (0 Euros in this case).

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's criteria of comparing maximum probabilities to make a decision. The verbal report indicates a consideration of loss and probability but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for losing 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros, or not losing). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 90% chance of losing 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 55% chance of not losing (0 Euros)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the probabilities and noticed that Lottery A had a high probability of losing money, while Lottery B had at least a 55% chance of not losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the aspect of not losing money, highlighting the higher chance of avoiding loss in Lottery B compared to the near certainty of loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case would be the 90% probability of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the 55% probability of not losing in Lottery B. The individual considered the probabilities but framed them in terms of losing or not losing, which aligns with comparing the maximum probabilities but focuses on the outcome of not losing rather than the specific probabilities themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual seems to prefer Lottery B because it offers a higher chance of not losing (55%) compared to the near certainty of losing in Lottery A. However, the decision reason would actually prefer Lottery A due to its higher maximum probability (90%), which does not align with the individual's reasoning as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Instead, the individual focuses on the aspect of avoiding loss, which leads to a preference for Lottery B based on its 55% chance of not losing, contrary to what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A for its 90% probability). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of losing money, specifically comparing the 0.2% chance of losing in Lottery A to the implied higher risk in Lottery B, though the specific probability (0.1%) is not mentioned. They seem to focus on the risk of losing and the amount lost.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for taking a ""somewhat higher risk"" (though this seems to be a misunderstanding since the risk of loss is actually lower in Lottery B) if it means losing less. The deliberation process seems to involve comparing the risks and potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of not losing (99.8% for A and 99.9% for B). However, the individual discusses the probability of losing and the amount of loss, not directly addressing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (which would be Lottery B due to its 99.9% probability of not losing), but the individual's justification is based on minimizing loss when taking a ""higher risk,"" which does not align with the decision reason’s rule of maximizing the probability of the most likely outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the maximum probabilities of the lotteries or preferred the lottery based on this criterion. Instead, their focus was on the risk of loss and the amount that could be lost, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability, while Lottery B offers 500 Euros with 100% probability. The maximum probability for Lottery A is 50% and for Lottery B is 100%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for A and 100% for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions wanting to ""be on the safe side"" (""auf Nummer sicher gehen""), which implies considering the certainty or risk associated with each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is the desire to be safe, which led to choosing Lottery B. The described deliberation process focuses on the aspect of safety or certainty, not explicitly on the probabilities but on the outcomes' reliability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (safety or certainty), we see that while the decision reason directly considers probabilities, the individual's consideration of safety indirectly relates to the concept of probability (as higher probability of a positive outcome can be seen as safer). However, the individual does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing the safer option), we observe that both lead to preferring Lottery B, but the individual's justification is based on the concept of safety rather than explicitly on the maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's verbal report suggests an emphasis on safety, which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not directly indicate that the decision was based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, while there is a conceptual overlap, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report, leading to an uncertain assessment."

For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of -500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing half of the time in Lottery B and the desire to leave with at least +1500 Euros, implying a consideration of potential gains and risks associated with each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to potentially gain more (implied by wanting to leave with at least +1500 Euros) and perceived the risk in the other lottery (Lottery A, with a certain loss) as too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (potential gains, risks, and desire for a certain outcome): The individual's considerations do not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on potential gains and risk avoidance): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there is no mention of comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), but it also has two outcomes with 25% probability each. However, the maximum probability for any single outcome in Lottery B is 25% for the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes, but since 50% is the highest probability for any outcome (0 Euros), this is considered. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 75% (for 0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50% (for 0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning something in each lottery, focusing on the aspect of winning something with a certain probability rather than the specific amounts.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred winning something with a 50% probability (implied by the statement of preferring to win something at 50% rather than at 25%) over winning with a 25% probability. The statement suggests the individual is comparing the chances of getting any positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the probability of winning something, which seems to align with comparing probabilities but focuses on the aspect of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification seems to focus on the probability of winning something rather than the maximum probability of any single outcome. The individual's statement about preferring a 50% chance of winning something over a 25% chance does not directly align with comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as defined by the decision reason (75% for Lottery A vs. 50% for Lottery B).

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the probability of winning something at all, rather than the specific rule of comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, suggests that while there is some alignment in considering probabilities, the decision reason's specific rule about maximum probabilities does not directly match the individual's justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case is the probability of not losing money (0 Euros). The individual also considered the chance of not losing money, aligning with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this context translates to the higher probability of not losing money. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it has a higher chance of not losing money compared to Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for winning 0 Euros, but there's a 0.1% chance of winning 5000 Euros. The information relevant to this reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the relevant information is:

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of potential winnings and felt possible gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (100% probability of winning 5 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the potential for higher winnings, not the probability of the outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes. The individual focused on the potential for higher winnings rather than the probabilities of the outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (associated with a 0 Euro outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (associated with a -5 Euro outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a significant amount of money and the option to avoid this risk by choosing the lottery with a certain, though smaller, loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring to avoid risk and opting for a certain loss of 5 Euros instead of risking a larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual focused on avoiding risk and certain loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of probability but is more centered on the outcome values and risk aversion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability of a -5 Euro outcome. The individual's justification, while not directly mentioning probabilities, aligns with choosing the lottery that guarantees an outcome (Lottery A), suggesting an indirect consideration of the certainty (or maximum probability) of the outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus on risk avoidance and preference for a certain outcome over a risky one suggests an alignment with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability but does not directly state this as the reason. Therefore, there is some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was explicitly used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1500 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process, focusing on the desire for a ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way) and the concern about the 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B. The information considered by the individual includes the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B. The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery A is to avoid the high risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of outcome in Lottery A and risk in Lottery B), it's clear that the individual is aware of the certain outcome in Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on maximum probability. However, the individual's justification is more focused on avoiding risk rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but based their decision on the desire for a safe outcome, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason since the safe outcome is a result of the 100% probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability), the justification provided in the verbal report (focusing on risk avoidance) does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it's somewhat uncertain whether the decision reason was explicitly used, but there's a leaning towards its influence due to the alignment of the choice with the reason's preference for the higher maximum probability."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning and losing), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 2000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery B and the risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guaranteed a win of 2000 Euros, and they perceived the risk of losing money with Lottery A as too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (guarantee of winning and risk of losing). The individual's consideration of the guarantee (which implies a 100% probability of winning with Lottery B) aligns with the aspect of maximum probability, but they do not explicitly mention comparing probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose Lottery B for its guarantee, avoiding the risk of loss in Lottery A). The individual's justification indirectly reflects a preference for the higher maximum probability (100% guarantee with Lottery B over the 50% chance of winning or losing with Lottery A), but it is framed in terms of risk avoidance rather than a direct comparison of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's decision to choose Lottery B because of its guarantee can be seen as indirectly reflecting the decision reason's preference for the higher maximum probability. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made by comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. The focus on the guarantee and risk avoidance suggests that while the outcome aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the process might not have directly involved comparing maximum probabilities as the primary criterion. Thus, the assessment is higher than the midpoint (50) because the choice aligns with the decision reason, but it is not a perfect match in terms of the explicit reasoning process described."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 50%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 100%
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, it would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""die Sicherheit"" (safety or certainty) was important to them, implying they considered the aspect of guaranteed outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around the importance of having a certain win, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome over a risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, which directly relates to the certainty or safety the individual mentions. The individual's consideration of certainty aligns with evaluating the maximum probability of winning in each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (Lottery B, with 100% probability of winning), which aligns with the individual's preference for certainty (or safety) in winning, as expressed in their justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100"
20,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for 0 Euros. 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and their past behavior of playing it safe, which has given them a buffer to take risks now.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for taking the risk is based on their past conservative behavior, which has provided them with a buffer to take risks, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's consideration is more about their past behavior and the risk they can afford to take, not directly about comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing probabilities in this manner; instead, it focuses on their ability to take a risk due to past conservative decisions.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on their past behavior and current ability to take risks, not on the maximum probability of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
