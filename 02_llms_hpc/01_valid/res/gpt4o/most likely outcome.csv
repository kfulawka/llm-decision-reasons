4,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason focuses on the most probable outcomes of each lottery. 
- Therefore, we need to identify the outcome with the highest probability for each lottery.

Lottery A:
- Most probable outcome: 0 Euros (55% probability)

Lottery B:
- Most probable outcome: 3000 Euros (90% probability)

The relevant information is derived: 
- For Lottery A, the most probable outcome is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the most probable outcome is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable most probable outcome.
- For Lottery A, the most probable outcome is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the most probable outcome is 3000 Euros.
