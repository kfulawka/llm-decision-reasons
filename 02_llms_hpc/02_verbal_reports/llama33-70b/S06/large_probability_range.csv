STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the certain gain of Lottery A and the potential additional 100 Euros of Lottery B, along with the risk of not making any gain with Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that the potential additional gain with Lottery B was not worth the risk of not receiving any payout.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain vs. potential for additional money and risk of no gain), it appears the individual focused more on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than explicitly calculating or considering the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the certainty of the gain and the risk aversion. Therefore, the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as 67% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 33%. The difference is 33% - 0% = 33%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicit, as 66% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 34%. The difference is 34% - 0% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of both lotteries and compared them. They noted that the possible gain in Lottery A was not much higher than in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a higher probability of winning over a slightly higher potential gain, implying they chose based on the probability of winning rather than the difference in potential gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of choosing a higher chance of winning, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (34% difference) over Lottery A (33% difference). However, the individual's justification is about preferring a higher probability of winning due to the gain not being significantly higher in one lottery over the other, not directly about the difference in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's focus was more on the comparative probabilities of winning and the potential gains rather than the specific calculation of probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in probability ranges for each lottery: 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and gains, noting that Lottery B is a sure win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it is a sure win and they wanted to avoid risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains, with a focus on the certainty of one outcome): The individual's consideration of probabilities aligns with the decision reason's focus on probability differences but emphasizes the aspect of risk avoidance rather than the calculation of probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding risk by choosing the certain outcome): The decision reason would actually prefer Lottery A due to its larger difference in probability (60% vs. 0%), which contradicts the individual's choice based on avoiding risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on avoiding risk and preferring a certain outcome, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference in probability. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A, not Lottery B, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as 100% - 25% = 75% and the outcome is 0 Euros with this probability) and the maximum probability is 25%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicit, as 100% - 20% = 80% and the outcome is 0 Euros with this probability) and the maximum probability is 20%. The difference is 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the comparison between the higher gain and the higher probability, indicating a focus on the trade-off between potential outcomes and their likelihood, rather than explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains), it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the specific differences in probability ranges as the decision reason dictates. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (focusing on the trade-off between higher gain and higher probability), the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was more on the comparative values of the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities themselves.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 55% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (6000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the good winning chances of Lottery A and the absence of a threatening loss. They also compared the winning probabilities between Lotteries A and B, noting that Lottery A had a much higher winning probability.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by focusing on the higher winning probability of Lottery A and stating that the potential win amount of Lottery B became irrelevant due to its lower winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more about the absolute probabilities of winning and the absence of a significant loss in Lottery A, rather than the difference between the probabilities within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with an 80% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A and does not explicitly mention the difference in probabilities within each lottery as the reason for their choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Their focus was on the higher winning probability of Lottery A and the lack of a significant loss, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the fact that they would likely win 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher probability of winning, implying they focused on the likelihood of the positive outcome rather than the difference in probability ranges.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the likelihood of winning and the fact that they would likely win 0 Euros, not explicitly on the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.8% difference vs. 99.6% for B). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher probability of the positive outcome, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual based their choice on the higher probability of winning in Lottery B, not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A due to its larger difference in probabilities (60% vs. 0%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high losses in both lotteries A and B, noting that the loss in A was not much higher than in B but also recognized the 20% chance of no loss in A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual weighed whether the 20% chance of no loss was worth the potentially higher loss of 1000 Euros in A compared to B and decided that this chance was significant enough to choose A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the presence of a 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A and compared the potential losses between the two lotteries, not explicitly discussing the difference in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but justified this choice based on the value of the 20% chance of no loss, not explicitly because of the difference in probability ranges between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual did choose Lottery A, which is the preferred choice according to the decision reason, the justification provided (focusing on the value of the 20% chance of no loss) does not match the rule specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the basis for the individual's choice, but there is a slight possibility due to the overlap in the preferred outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the possible loss amounts of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a lower probability of loss over a smaller loss amount because even the smaller loss is very high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of probability differences, but the individual focused on the probabilities and loss amounts themselves, not the differences between the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on preferring a lower probability of loss and considering the magnitude of the loss.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason to make the decision. The individual's focus was more on the absolute probabilities of loss and the magnitude of potential losses rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (-6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and losses of the two lotteries and considered the likelihood of a loss in each.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of no loss was over 50% for A and only around 55% for B (though the individual mentions ""nur bei 10%"" which seems to be a mistake, as the probability of no loss for B is actually 55%, not 10%). The individual focused on the higher probability of avoiding a loss with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on comparing the probabilities of losses and the overall likelihood of avoiding a loss, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with an 80% difference. However, the individual's justification does not mention this rule; instead, it focuses on the higher probability of avoiding a loss with Lottery A. The individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implied, as the only other outcome is 0.2% for the loss) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (for the 0 Euros outcome), making the difference 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implied, for the 0 Euros outcome is not the focus, but the loss has a probability) and the maximum probability is 99.9%, making the difference 99.9%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences between the minimum and maximum outcomes for each lottery, which are 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and losses of both options, noting that a loss was very unlikely in both but slightly more likely in one option and twice as high in that option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the comparison of the likelihood and magnitude of losses, considering one option had a slightly higher probability of loss but with a loss that was twice as high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the probabilities and magnitudes of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on the comparison of loss probabilities and magnitudes, not the differences in probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability differences between the minimum and maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's decision seems to be influenced by the probability and magnitude of potential losses rather than the range of probabilities for each lottery.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (1000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (500 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% difference in probabilities
- Lottery B: 0% difference in probabilities

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain at Lottery B, the probabilities at Lottery A, and compared the gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by stating that the additional 500 Euros were not worth the risk of not making a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences in probabilities between the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the certain gain and the risk, but not the probability differences as required by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the decision reason involves comparing these differences, we must consider if the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The information relevant is the probability ranges of each lottery, which are [100%] for Lottery A and [50%, 50%] for Lottery B. The difference in probability for both lotteries is 0%, but the reasoning behind the decision rule implies looking for a lottery with a larger difference, which does not directly apply since both have the same difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and losses of the lotteries, weighing the potential for a higher loss against the chance of no loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the comparison of potential losses and the perceived value of a 50% chance of no loss, considering the difference in potential loss amounts (500 Euros more in one scenario).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and losses but did not discuss the range of probabilities as a deciding factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual’s justification (comparing potential losses and the value of a 50% chance of no loss).

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for both 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability (50%) - Minimum probability (25%) = 25%
- Lottery B: Maximum probability (75%) - Minimum probability (25%) = 50%
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and outcomes, noting a 50% chance of winning in Lottery A, which is twice as much as in Lottery B. They mention that the differences in win amounts were irrelevant to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification focuses on the comparison of probabilities, specifically highlighting the 50% chance in Lottery A as a key factor, without considering the win amounts.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences between maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the presence of a 50% chance in Lottery A and compared it directly to Lottery B without explicitly discussing the differences in maximum and minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of specific probabilities (50% in Lottery A being twice as much as in Lottery B) and does not explicitly mention the rule of comparing the differences between maximum and minimum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on the specific probability of winning in Lottery A and its comparison to Lottery B, rather than on the difference between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery.

For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (as there is no variation in probability). This information is relevant and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the probabilities of the lotteries and initially considered choosing Lottery B because a 0 Euro outcome is very likely. They then thought about the loss of 5 Euros being acceptable to avoid a small risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for their choice seems to hinge on the avoidance of risk, specifically mentioning the desire to avoid a small risk by accepting a certain loss of 5 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk avoidance and the comparison of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (as implied, though not directly stated) seems to be based on avoiding risk rather than comparing the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on risk avoidance and the acceptance of a certain loss to avoid a potential larger loss does not reflect a consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the probabilities of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, implying no other outcomes have any probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the secure gain offered by Lottery B and the risk of loss (50% probability of losing 3000 Euros) associated with Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the presence of a secure gain and the perceived risk of Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (difference in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (secure gain in B, risk of loss in A), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. The individual's justification focused more on the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss rather than the probability ranges of the lotteries. Therefore, while the individual chose Lottery B, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about comparing the differences in probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, implying no other outcome has a probability greater than 0%) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%
- Lottery B: Difference = 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and gains of both lotteries, noting both gains were high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a secure gain, and Lottery A was considered too risky due to its uncertain outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual considered probabilities but focused on the security of the gain in Lottery B rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification was based on the security of the gain, not the probability difference.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery to make their decision. Instead, the decision was influenced by the perceived risk and the security of the gain.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the reason, we need to understand that it looks for the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason, as stated, does not inherently prefer one lottery over the other based on the given probabilities alone, but it's crucial to note the reason's nature: it seeks the larger difference, implying a preference for lotteries with more varied outcomes in terms of probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed gain in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on avoiding risk, as they preferred the certain gain of Lottery A over the risky outcomes of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the risk (possibility of loss) and the certainty of gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities does not directly align with the individual's risk avoidance strategy as described. The individual's choice was based on avoiding risk, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a significant loss with Lottery A (50% chance of losing 6000 Euros) and the certainty of no loss or gain with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the risk of a large loss with Lottery A was too high, and not making a loss or gain with Lottery B seemed more sensible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is centered around the risk of loss and the certainty of no outcome in the other lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, this reason would not differentiate between them. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived risk and the certainty of outcomes, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. The individual's decision was based on the perceived risk and the certainty of outcomes, not on the probability differences as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
