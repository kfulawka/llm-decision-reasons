STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it only requires information about the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries. The maximum outcome for Lottery A is 2500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2400 Euros. This information can be derived directly from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the following information: the 100% probability of winning 2400 Euros in Lottery B and the 33% chance of winning 2500 Euros in Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of winning 2400 Euros and the reluctance to risk the additional 100 Euros (implied difference between the maximum outcomes) for a lower probability of a higher gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did consider the maximum outcomes indirectly, focusing on the difference in the maximum possible wins and the certainty of one of the outcomes. However, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) does not align perfectly with the individual's justification. The individual prioritized the certainty of a slightly lower outcome over the potential for a higher outcome with lower probability, rather than strictly choosing based on the maximum possible win.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual did consider aspects related to the decision reason (such as the maximum outcomes), their final justification for the choice was more influenced by the certainty of the outcome rather than strictly following the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher maximum outcome. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. From the problem, the maximum outcome of Lottery B is 2500 Euros, and the maximum outcome of Lottery A is 2400 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the percentages (probabilities) are almost the same (""Prozent zahlen sind fast gleich""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. They then mention deciding based on ""100 Euro mehr,"" which suggests they compared the monetary outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is the difference in the maximum outcomes (""100 Euro mehr""), implying that the decision was made based on the difference in the maximum amounts that could be won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the monetary outcomes, specifically the difference in the maximum amounts. However, the decision reason focuses on the absolute maximum outcome of each lottery, not the difference between them.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the ""100 Euro mehr""), it appears the individual's decision was influenced by the comparative value rather than the absolute maximum outcome. The decision reason would lead to choosing Lottery B because it has a higher maximum outcome, but the individual's statement suggests they chose based on the comparative advantage of one lottery over the other, not explicitly the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which prioritizes the lottery with the higher maximum outcome. The verbal report indicates a focus on the difference in outcomes rather than the maximum outcome itself, suggesting that while the individual considered the monetary aspects, the decision reason's specific rule about maximum outcomes was not the guiding principle. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges some consideration of relevant information."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: 4000 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of winning 4000 Euros (80%) and the certainty of winning 3000 Euros (100%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decides to forgo the 100% chance of winning 3000 Euros, implying they are considering the trade-off between the high probability of a lower amount and the lower probability of a higher amount, but the statement seems to suggest a preference for the certain outcome over the potential for a higher one, contrary to what the decision reason would prioritize.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), but the individual also considers the probabilities (80% for A and 100% for B), not just the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (4000 Euros). However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the certainty of winning over the maximum possible outcome, leading them to consider forgoing the 100% win of 3000 Euros, which does not align with the straightforward application of the decision reason as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's consideration of probabilities and the certainty of the outcome, rather than solely focusing on the maximum possible outcomes, and their expressed preference for the certain outcome over the potential for a higher one, indicates that they did not use the decision reason as the basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The key information is the maximum possible gain from each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries (""Zwischen Loterie A und B sind 1000 Euro differenz zu gewinnen"") and mentions a willingness to take a 5% risk (""5 % gewinn oder verlier Risiko""). The individual seems to consider the potential gain difference and is weighing the risk involved in choosing one lottery over the other.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B) with that considered by the individual (difference in potential winnings and risk), it appears the individual is aware of the maximum outcomes indirectly by discussing the difference in potential winnings. However, the decision reason specifically focuses on the maximum outcome to make a preference, which is not explicitly mentioned as the sole criterion in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice seems to involve a consideration of the risk and the difference in potential winnings rather than solely the maximum outcome of each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process involves an awareness of the potential outcomes, it does not clearly align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the maximum outcome. The consideration of risk and the difference in winnings introduces elements not directly related to the decision reason, leading to uncertainty about whether the decision reason was the primary basis for the choice. However, given the focus on outcomes, there is some relevance, hence the assessment is not at the lowest end of the scale."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for this reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros. This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers the difference between the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros) as significant (""riesen unterschied""). The individual also mentions the probability of winning in Lottery B as ""hoher gewinn Prozentual"" (high winning percentage), which refers to the 45% chance of winning 6000 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be based on the higher maximum outcome it offers and the perceived high probability of winning.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it is clear that the individual also focused on the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which is Lottery B with 6000 Euros. The individual's justification for the choice aligns with this rule, as they chose Lottery B due to its higher maximum outcome and considered the probability of winning this outcome as favorable. Therefore, both the considered information and the justification align with the decision reason.

6,"STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros. This information is directly derivable from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum payout of each lottery: 6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual notes that Lottery B has a lower sum (maximum outcome) but a higher percentage chance of winning compared to Lottery A. However, the individual concludes that the doubled sum (maximum outcome) of Lottery A makes the 0.2% winning chance of Lottery B insignificant. The information considered by the individual includes the maximum outcomes of the lotteries and their respective probabilities. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the comparison of the maximum outcomes and how the difference in these outcomes outweighs the difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it's clear that the individual did consider the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification also hinges on the comparison of the maximum outcomes, concluding that the higher maximum outcome of Lottery A is more significant than the slightly higher probability of Lottery B. This alignment suggests that the individual used a reasoning process that is consistent with the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the best possible outcome, despite its low probability), and for Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the relevant information is: 
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 0 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: -3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss and the risk associated with each lottery, specifically mentioning the difference in the amount that could be lost and the preference for not taking a risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because it means not risking losing an additional 1000 Euros (implied by comparing the guaranteed loss of 3000 Euros to the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery B), and there's a preference for avoiding risk by taking the certain loss over the potential for a larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes, but the individual's consideration seems to be more about the risk of losing more money and avoiding that risk, rather than specifically comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A, justifying it based on risk avoidance and the certainty of the loss, not the maximum potential outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason that focuses on the maximum outcome of each lottery to make the decision. Instead, the decision was influenced by risk avoidance and the preference for a certain outcome over a potential larger loss.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason can be applied, but it would lead to indifference between the two lotteries because neither has a more favorable maximum outcome than the other.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential losses between the two lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a loss of 1000 Euros less than Lottery A, despite the percentage chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is 1000 Euros less, regardless of the percentage chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome, but the individual focused on the difference in potential losses, not the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing loss, not comparing maximum outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the maximum outcome of each lottery to make the decision.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros (a loss), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also -3000 Euros (a loss). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B since -3000 Euros is more favorable than -6000 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the probability of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B, stating it as 90%. However, this seems to be a misunderstanding since the 90% probability in Lottery B is associated with losing 3000 Euros, not 6000 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on this incorrect interpretation of the probabilities associated with the outcomes of Lottery B. The described deliberation process focuses on the probability of losing a specific amount in Lottery B, but the information is misinterpreted.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the misinterpreted probability of losing a specific amount in Lottery B), there is a discrepancy. The individual does not directly compare the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. Instead, the individual's decision is based on a misinterpretation of the probability associated with one of the outcomes. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its less severe maximum loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros). However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule due to the misinterpretation of the lottery's structure.

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's -6000 Euros. This information is directly derivable from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""6000 Euro Verlust"" (6000 Euro loss) and compares it to ""3000 Euro,"" indicating they are considering the maximum outcomes of both lotteries. They also mention ""% Anzahl"" (% number), which likely refers to the probabilities, stating they are ""sehr identisch"" (very similar), though this is not directly relevant to the decision reason in question.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be focusing on the magnitude of the potential loss, stating that a ""6000 Euro Verlust"" is ""deutlich weniger"" (clearly less) than ""3000 Euro,"" which appears to be a misunderstanding or misstatement since a 6000 Euro loss is actually more significant than a 3000 Euro loss. However, the comparison of outcomes is the core of their deliberation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome of each lottery, which the individual also considers, albeit with a seeming error in comparing the magnitudes of loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, seems flawed in its comparison, suggesting a possible misapplication of the decision reason due to the confusion in comparing losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates they considered the maximum outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason. However, their justification and comparison of these outcomes are flawed, suggesting they did not accurately apply the decision reason as intended. Thus, while there's some alignment in what they considered, their application and justification do not closely follow the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries: 500 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possibility of winning 500 Euros more with Lottery B and acknowledges the risk of losing but is willing to take it for the chance at a higher reward.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because they are willing to risk not winning (with a 50% chance) for the possibility of winning 1000 Euros, implying they value the higher potential reward over the guaranteed but lower reward of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual does consider the higher potential reward of Lottery B, which aligns with focusing on maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice, the individual's decision to choose Lottery B because of its higher potential reward aligns with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's focus on the maximum outcomes and preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros (since it's a guaranteed loss of 500 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since there's a 50% chance of losing nothing). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: maximum outcome of Lottery A = -500 Euros, and maximum outcome of Lottery B = 0 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the information considered by the individual includes the fact that Lottery A guarantees a loss of 500 Euros (100% chance of losing) and that Lottery B has a 50% chance of resulting in no loss (0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the presence of a 50% probability of not losing anything, which implies they considered the potential for avoiding loss as a significant factor.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed loss in A vs. chance of no loss in B), it's clear the individual focused on the aspect of avoiding loss, which aligns with considering the maximum (or least negative) outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery B because its maximum outcome (0 Euros) is more favorable than Lottery A's (-500 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing (which can be interpreted as focusing on the maximum outcome of 0 Euros) aligns with the decision reason's rule.

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it only requires information about the maximum outcome of each lottery. The relevant information is as follows: 
- Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 6000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 4000 Euros.
This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, we find that the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. Specifically, they mentioned the probability of winning 2000 or 4000 Euros in Lottery B, which combines to a 50% chance, and compared this to the high outcome of Lottery A, which they noted has a lower probability. The individual's justification for their choice seems to hinge on the perceived trade-off between the higher maximum outcome of Lottery A and its lower probability versus the combined probabilities of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with the information considered by the individual (probabilities and specific outcomes). The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum possible outcome, which would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher maximum outcome of 6000 Euros. However, the individual's justification in the verbal report does not explicitly prioritize the maximum outcome as the sole decision criterion. Instead, they seem to weigh the probabilities and the specific outcomes, mentioning the cumulative probability of winning in Lottery B and the high outcome of Lottery A being less appealing due to its lower probability. The individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of solely considering the maximum outcome to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome (or the least negative, in this context) is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. However, since the reason focuses on the maximum outcome and both lotteries have a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, we must consider how the reason would handle this scenario. The key information relevant to the decision reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery, which, in a typical application, would compare the best possible outcomes. Here, the decision reason's straightforward application might not directly apply as both have a 0 Euro maximum, but we can infer that the individual might consider the least negative or the presence of a zero outcome as a tie in maximum outcomes. Thus, we need to see how the individual's reasoning aligns with this in the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the percentage (""Zahl"") does not play a role and compares the potential losses, noting that a loss of 6000 Euros is more significant than losses of 2000 or 4000 Euros. This suggests the individual is focusing on the magnitude of potential losses rather than the probabilities or the maximum positive outcome in a traditional sense.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential loss in Lottery B (6000 Euros) is greater than the losses in Lottery A (2000 or 4000 Euros), indicating a consideration of the worst-case scenario rather than the maximum favorable outcome as defined by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome, but the individual discusses the magnitude of losses, not the maximum (best) outcomes. This indicates a mismatch in the information considered.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on avoiding the larger loss, not necessarily choosing the lottery with the best maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined, which focuses on the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual considered the magnitude of potential losses.

The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is that Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 5000 Euros and Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the low probability (0.1%) of winning with Lottery A and decides it's not worth the risk, implying they considered the probability of the outcome and the value of the guaranteed amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the low probability of winning in Lottery A makes it not worth the risk, and they prefer the guaranteed 5 Euros to buy something they like (Schokolade).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (5000 Euros for A and 5 Euros for B), but the individual's consideration is more about the risk associated with the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the value of the guaranteed outcome in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A due to its higher maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification is based on the risk and the preference for a guaranteed, albeit smaller, reward, not directly on comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since -5000 Euros is the worst outcome, and 0 Euros is the best), and for Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries: 0 Euros for Lottery B and -5 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability and the amount of potential loss in both lotteries, mentioning the 0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B and the certainty of losing 5 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because, despite the low probability, the amount of 5000 Euros is very large, and thus, they prefer the certain loss of 5 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (0 Euros for Lottery B and -5 Euros for Lottery A), but the individual discusses the potential losses and their probabilities, not directly comparing the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros vs. -5 Euros), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the magnitude of potential loss and its probability, not directly because of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification focuses on the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities rather than comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which is what the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a more favorable maximum outcome (3000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (1500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to involve a comparison of outcomes, noting that one outcome is ""doppelt mehr"" (twice as much), which likely refers to the comparison between the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros being twice 1500 Euros).
Second, the individual's justification for their choice is based on the attractiveness of the higher potential gain, indicated by ""gewinn ist wieder doppelt mehr"" and the willingness to take a risk with a 50% probability of winning, as stated by ""versuche mein Glück mit 50% gewinn wahrscheinlichkeit.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the comparison of outcomes and the attractiveness of the higher gain), it appears the individual did consider the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (focusing on the higher potential gain and the willingness to take a risk for it), the individual's reasoning aligns with preferring the lottery based on its maximum potential, even if the report does not explicitly state a comparison of maximum outcomes in a traditional sense.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the individual's focus on the higher potential gain and the willingness to take a risk for it, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing maximum outcomes as the basis for the decision, hence not a 100% certainty."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. The relevant information for this reason is the maximum outcome of Lottery A, which is 3000 Euros, and the maximum outcome of Lottery B, which is 2000 Euros. This information can be derived directly from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the potential gain from Lottery A, mentioning the possibility of winning more (1000 Euro mehr) if they choose Lottery A, even with a 50% probability. The individual's justification for their choice seems to be the desire to win more, indicating a focus on the potential maximum gain from the lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential for higher gain with Lottery A), it appears the individual is indeed focusing on the aspect of winning more, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it offers the potential to win more (even with the mentioned risk) suggests they are applying a similar logic. The individual's mention of risking for a higher potential gain directly aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process. The individual considers the difference in potential outcomes (2000 Euros) and weighs the certainty of 1000 Euros against a 50% chance of winning a higher amount. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the potential for a higher gain, despite the risk involved, as indicated by the phrase ""50% gewinn chance ausprobieren"" which translates to ""try the 50% chance of winning.""

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with what the individual considered (the difference in outcomes and the chance of winning a higher amount). The individual does seem to be aware of the higher potential outcome of Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the maximum outcome. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome without considering probabilities, whereas the individual's justification mentions the 50% chance, indicating some consideration of probability. Despite this, the core of the decision reason (preferring the higher maximum outcome) seems to align with the individual's leaning towards trying for the higher potential gain due to its higher maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the probabilistic nature of lottery playing and the specific probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries. The individual mentions the 50% chance of winning or losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A and compares it to the 100% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B. The justification for choosing Lottery A is that it's worth trying due to the potential high reward, implying that the individual values the possibility of a significant gain over the certainty of no gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did consider the outcomes, particularly the high reward of Lottery A. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A aligns with this rule, as they were attracted to the potential of winning 6000 Euros, which is the more favorable maximum outcome compared to Lottery B's 0 Euros. Therefore, it seems the individual used a reasoning process that aligns with the decision reason.
