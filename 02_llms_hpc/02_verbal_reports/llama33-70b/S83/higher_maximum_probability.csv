STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% for a gain of 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100% for 2400 Euros.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 66% for 2400 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered that Lottery A offers a high amount with certainty, while Lottery B offers only slightly more in the best case but also includes a small chance of receiving nothing. The difference in the amount won is minimal, but Lottery A provides a sure gain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by emphasizing the certainty of a high gain with Lottery A, the minimal difference in potential gains between the two lotteries, and the risk of receiving nothing with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the primary consideration. The individual, however, does consider the certainty (100% probability) of gaining a high amount with Lottery A, which aligns with the concept of maximum probability but is framed in terms of certainty rather than comparing maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability for 2400 Euros. The individual's justification emphasizes the certainty and security of Lottery A's outcome, which indirectly aligns with preferring the higher maximum probability but does not directly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing maximum probabilities. However, the emphasis on certainty and security with Lottery A suggests an alignment with the principle of preferring higher probabilities for positive outcomes, even if not explicitly framed as a comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process aligns with preferring the lottery that offers a certain gain (which happens to have the highest maximum probability), the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the decision was made by directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the decision reason prescribes. The emphasis is more on the certainty and minimal difference in gains rather than a direct comparison of probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is also 67% (probability of winning 0 Euros). Since both lotteries have their maximum probabilities associated with winning 0 Euros, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a slightly higher maximum probability (67% vs 66%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers both the amounts that can be won and the chances of winning them, noting that the two lotteries are almost equal in both aspects.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning that Lottery B offers a slightly higher potential win at nearly the same chance, without explicitly mentioning the probabilities of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case is the probability of not winning. However, the individual's consideration is more focused on the comparison of potential winnings and their associated probabilities, rather than the probabilities of not winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (which would be Lottery B due to its 67% chance of winning 0 Euros), but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its higher potential payout at a similar chance, not the probability of not winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on the potential winnings and their associated probabilities, rather than the probabilities of not winning, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
3,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% for winning 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries: 100% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a higher maximum probability, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery A (""Bei A gewinnt man auf jeden Fall""), the high chance of winning with Lottery B but also the risk of receiving nothing, and compares the difference in winnings (""Der Unterschied der Gewinnbeträge ist nicht so groß"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certainty of Lottery A over the higher potential reward of Lottery B because the difference in winnings is not large enough to justify the risk of possibly receiving nothing (""Dann lieber sicher gehen"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of winning, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B. However, the individual's focus is more on the risk of losing and the comparative value of the winnings rather than explicitly stating a preference for the higher maximum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery A. The individual also chooses Lottery A but justifies this choice based on the desire for certainty and the comparative value of the potential winnings, not explicitly because it has the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), and they consider the aspect of certainty (which relates to the maximum probability). However, the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly mention preferring the lottery because it has the higher maximum probability, but rather focuses on the certainty of the outcome and the comparative values of the winnings. This indicates that while the decision reason might have influenced the choice, it was not the explicitly stated rationale. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but without complete certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of winning for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability (of winning or losing) is 80% (losing), and for Lottery B, it is 75% (losing). However, since the reason focuses on the probability of winning as the basis for comparison, we consider the probabilities of winning: 20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B. This information is relevant and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that with neither lottery can one lose money, the probability of winning is approximately equally high, and while the chance of winning with A is slightly lower, the potential gain is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount that can be won, noting the slightly lower chance of winning with A but the higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum probability of winning, which is not the primary focus of the individual's deliberation. The individual considers both the probability of winning and the potential gain, not just the probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of winning, which would be Lottery B in this case (25% vs. 20%). However, the individual's justification suggests a consideration of both probability and potential gain, not a straightforward preference for the higher probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason's sole focus on the maximum probability of winning as the basis for the choice. The individual considers multiple factors, including the amount that can be won, which suggests that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (associated with 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 90% (associated with 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities associated with the most likely outcomes of each lottery. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that neither lottery results in a loss, the potential gain of Lottery A is twice that of Lottery B but is much less probable, and the gain from Lottery B, although lower, is still very good and very probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the magnitude of the potential gain and its probability, noting the higher probability of a gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is related to but not exactly the same as the individual's consideration of the probability of gains. The individual discusses the probability of winning but in the context of comparing the two lotteries based on both the amount and the likelihood of the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification emphasizes the high probability of a ""very good"" gain in Lottery B, suggesting a preference for the more probable outcome, aligning with the decision reason's rule but not solely focusing on the maximum probability as the deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's consideration of the probability of gains and the emphasis on the high likelihood of a good outcome in Lottery B suggest some alignment with the decision reason. However, the individual's justification also considers the magnitude of the potential gains, indicating that the decision was not based solely on the maximum probability. Therefore, while there is evidence to suggest the decision reason played a role, it is not the only factor considered, leading to an assessment that is more than uncertain (50) but not certain (100) that the decision reason was used."
6,"give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for winning 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities. Since 99.9% is higher than 99.8%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A based on the maximum probability.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers that the probability of winning in both lotteries is very small. The individual also notes that if a win occurs, the amount won in Lottery A is double that of Lottery B. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the comparison of the winning amounts when a win occurs, not directly on the probabilities of winning or the maximum probabilities.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (small probabilities of winning and the comparative winning amounts), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual does not explicitly discuss the maximum probabilities (which are for losing in both cases) as the basis for their decision. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification is based on the comparative winnings if a win occurs, not the probabilities of those outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice might coincidentally align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the maximum probability rule. The individual's focus is on the potential winnings and their comparative sizes, not on the probabilities themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a loss of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% for a loss of 4000 Euros, but there's also a 20% probability of losing 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The maximum probabilities are 100% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain loss at Lottery A as very high and the loss at Lottery B as even higher but notes there's a small chance to lose nothing with Lottery B. They compare the difference in loss amounts between the two lotteries and consider the risk of the higher loss at Lottery B against the chance of no loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the certain but smaller loss of Lottery A against the potentially larger loss of Lottery B, which has a chance of resulting in no loss. The justification focuses on the balance between the risk of a higher loss and the potential for no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the certain loss at A, the potential for a higher loss at B, and the chance of no loss at B), we see that the individual's considerations do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (weighing the risk of loss against the chance of no loss), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process does not explicitly follow the rule of choosing based on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual is more focused on the balance of potential losses and the chance of avoiding loss rather than the probabilities themselves.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that neither lottery offers a gain, the loss is higher in Lottery A, and the probability of loss is higher in Lottery B but not significantly enough to offset the difference in loss amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify the choice based on the balance between the amount of potential loss and the probability of that loss, rather than focusing solely on the probability of the most likely outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of the 0 Euro outcome in both cases. The individual, however, discusses the balance between loss amounts and their probabilities, not directly addressing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (in this case, Lottery A with 80% for 0 Euros), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the highest probability of its most likely outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. Instead, the justification focuses on the trade-off between the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities, without mentioning the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its most likely outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for losing 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros, as it's the higher probability between the two outcomes). 
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high loss amount in both lotteries but notes the high probability of losing in Lottery A and the potential to end up with 0 Euros in Lottery B with ""a bit of luck.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential losses and the chance of avoiding loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key factor. The individual discusses probabilities and outcomes but not in the context of identifying and comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its 90% probability for one of its outcomes. The individual's justification, however, seems more focused on the avoidance of loss and the role of luck rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the maximum probability of each lottery as the primary factor for their decision, which is what the decision reason is based on. The focus in the report is more on the potential outcomes and the role of luck rather than a systematic comparison of the probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.8% (also for winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (0 Euros for both lotteries).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing (which is very low and similar for both lotteries) and the amount lost if a loss occurs.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the similar low probability of losing in both lotteries but notes that Lottery B results in a lesser loss. The difference in probability is considered not to make much of a difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of not losing (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B). The individual, however, focuses on the probability of losing and the amount of loss, not directly on the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (which would be Lottery A due to its 99.9% probability of not losing), but the individual's justification does not directly address this comparison. Instead, the individual seems to prioritize the lesser loss in Lottery B over the slight difference in probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus and justification do not align with the decision reason's criteria, which is based solely on the maximum probability of each lottery. The verbal report indicates the individual considered different factors (probability of losing and amount of loss) and did not directly compare the lotteries based on their maximum probabilities as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 500 Euros). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% maximum probability
- Lottery B: 100% maximum probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the certainty of the gain for Lottery B and the higher potential gain of Lottery A, but also notes the risk of receiving nothing with Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to weigh the certainty of the gain against the potential higher gain and the associated risk, focusing on the security of the outcome.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. 
The individual considers the certainty of the gain for Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, indirectly touching upon the concept of probability. 
However, the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. 
The individual's justification emphasizes the security of the gain, which aligns with preferring a lottery with a higher certainty (or maximum probability) of a positive outcome. 
However, the individual's reasoning is not explicitly based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries but rather on the perceived security and risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's reasoning touches upon concepts related to the decision reason (such as the certainty of outcomes), it does not explicitly follow the rule of comparing maximum probabilities to make the decision. The emphasis on security and risk indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for higher maximum probability, but the connection is not direct or explicitly stated.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of each lottery, noting that Lottery A's potential loss is twice as high as Lottery B's but also mentions a 50/50 chance of not losing anything with Lottery A. For Lottery B, the individual notes the certain loss is quite high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential loss against the certainty of loss, considering the trade-off between the magnitude of potential loss and the probability of losing.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), but since there are two outcomes with the same highest probability (25% for both 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros), we consider the probability of the most favorable outcome which doesn't exceed 25%. However, the decision reason as stated focuses on the maximum probability regardless of the outcome, so for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% for the 0 Euro outcome. The relevant information is the probabilities of the outcomes of the lotteries, which are given.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of winning and the amounts. They mention that the win amounts in Lottery A are ""geringer"" (lower) but ""viel wahrscheinlicher"" (much more probable), indicating they are looking at the probabilities of winning and comparing them between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the amounts in Lottery A are ""hoch und in Ordnung"" (high and okay) and prefers this over the high risk of getting nothing in Lottery B, indicating a preference for a more certain, albeit lower, gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considers the probabilities but seems to focus more on the combination of probability and amount, not just the maximum probability of any outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference for a more probable win, even if the amount is lower, but does not directly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the sole basis for the decision.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual does consider probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the decision reason specifically looks at the maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's justification that emphasizes the balance between probability and amount. The individual's reasoning seems to incorporate a more nuanced view of risk and reward rather than solely focusing on the maximum probability of any outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as stated, primarily because the verbal report suggests a consideration of both the probability and the amount of the winnings, rather than solely the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus on the ""much more probable"" nature of wins in Lottery A and the preference for a lower but more certain gain indicates a decision-making process that goes beyond the simple comparison of maximum probabilities."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 75%
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 50%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the absence of a winning outcome in both lotteries, the higher loss amount in Lottery B but also its lower probability, and the relatively high loss amounts in Lottery A with their corresponding probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the magnitude of losses and their probabilities in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a higher potential loss but it's less probable, while Lottery A's losses are also significant but with a higher overall probability of some loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned as a criterion by the individual. The individual discusses probabilities but in the context of the magnitude of losses rather than the maximum probability of any single outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery B due to its 75% probability of 0 Euros. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum probability of outcomes but rather seems to consider a balance between the probability and magnitude of losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The report suggests a consideration of both the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities, without explicitly focusing on the maximum probability of any outcome as the sole or primary decision criterion."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 100% (for winning 5 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the small win in Lottery B, the small chance of winning something in Lottery A, and notes that receiving nothing (in the case of Lottery A's 99.9% outcome) does not make a big difference.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the existence of a chance to win in Lottery A and the guaranteed but small win in Lottery B, without directly comparing the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a point of consideration.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 100% probability of winning. The individual's justification, however, does not clearly indicate a preference based on the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, was used to make the decision. The report focuses on the presence of a chance to win in Lottery A and the small but guaranteed win in Lottery B, without explicit consideration of the maximum probabilities as the basis for the choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a loss of 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for a loss of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the following information: 
- Neither lottery offers a gain.
- Lottery A has a small certain loss.
- Lottery B has a very low chance of a high loss.
The individual's justification for the choice is to accept a small certain loss (Lottery A) over a very low chance of a high loss (Lottery B), because the loss amount in Lottery B is very high, even though the chance is very low.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focuses more on the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities rather than solely on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on the trade-off between the certainty of a small loss and the low probability of a significant loss, rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, does not directly align with the individual's justification, which emphasizes the acceptance of a certain small loss over a potential large loss with a very low probability.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The maximum probabilities are 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers that with Lottery A, one wins for sure and not a little, implying they recognize the certainty of the outcome. With Lottery B, they note there's a 50% chance to lose a lot, indicating awareness of the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the high risk of significant loss with Lottery B, suggesting they prioritize avoiding loss and value certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the risk of loss with Lottery B, which aligns with evaluating the probabilities of outcomes, though they don't explicitly mention comparing maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a sure win, which implies they prefer the higher certainty (or maximum probability) of a positive outcome. While the individual's justification emphasizes risk aversion and the value of certainty, it doesn't directly state a comparison of maximum probabilities but implies a preference for the option with the higher guaranteed outcome, which aligns with preferring higher maximum probability in this context.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, was influential in the individual's decision-making process, given their emphasis on the certainty of the outcome with Lottery A. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's justification focuses more on the avoidance of risk rather than explicitly comparing maximum probabilities."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considers the certain gain at Lottery A to be very high. They acknowledge that the potential gain at Lottery B is higher but note it is only 50% certain and that there is an equal chance of losing a significant amount. The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the certainty of the gain at Lottery A versus the uncertainty and potential downside of Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain at A, uncertainty and potential loss at B), it appears the individual is considering aspects related to the certainty of outcomes, which aligns with the concept of maximum probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with 100% probability. The individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of the gain at Lottery A, suggesting they prefer the option with the higher certainty, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 50% for Lottery A versus 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B, the smaller but still significant amount of money it offers compared to Lottery A, and the high risk of losing a substantial amount with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it guarantees a win, implying that the certainty of the outcome outweighed the potential for a higher reward in Lottery A, which comes with a significant risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of winning, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the guaranteed win in Lottery B. However, the individual also weighed the amount of money and the risk, not just the probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual chose Lottery B, citing the guarantee of winning, which indirectly reflects a consideration of the probability of winning but also includes other factors like the amount and risk.

Given these comparisons, the individual’s decision process seems to align with the decision reason in terms of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a positive outcome (100% for B vs. 50% for A), but the verbal report also indicates that the decision was influenced by the magnitude of the potential outcomes and the risk associated with Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and some of their reasoning align with the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability), their justification also includes considerations beyond just the probability, such as the amount of the potential win and the risk of loss. Thus, it is likely but not certain that the decision reason was a primary factor in the individual's decision-making process."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the fact that with Lottery B, one neither wins nor loses anything, implying they acknowledge the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B. They also consider the high potential loss in Lottery A and perceive this as risky. The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the avoidance of loss and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with what the individual considered (certainty of outcome in B, risk of loss in A), it appears the individual did consider aspects related to the certainty of outcomes, which aligns with the concept of maximum probability. However, the decision reason specifically focuses on the maximum probability as the criterion for preference, whereas the individual's justification seems more focused on the practical implications of these probabilities (avoiding loss, certainty). The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process touches upon aspects related to the certainty of outcomes (which is connected to the concept of maximum probability), it does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the maximum probability. The emphasis in the verbal report is more on the practical risk implications rather than a direct comparison of probabilities as the decision criterion."
