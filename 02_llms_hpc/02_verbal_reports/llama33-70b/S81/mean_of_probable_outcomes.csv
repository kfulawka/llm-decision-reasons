STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 (approximately 33.33%). For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so its single outcome is always probable since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 (100%). 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 2400 Euros with 66% probability and 2500 Euros with 33% probability, because both probabilities are higher than 1/3. The outcome 0 Euros with 1% probability is not considered probable.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (2400 * 0.66 + 2500 * 0.33) / (0.66 + 0.33) = (1584 + 825) / 0.99 = 2409 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 2400 Euros.
Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because its average of probable outcomes (2409 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain difference between Lottery A and Lottery B and the risk of receiving 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the risk of receiving 0 Euros being too high if the potential gain difference was not sufficiently high. The individual implies that higher potential gains in Lottery A could have justified the risk of getting 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating probabilities and outcomes. The individual considered the risk and potential gain difference but did not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the risk and potential gain, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's decision seems to be influenced more by the risk of the 0 Euro outcome and the potential gain difference rather than a calculated average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. While the individual considers risk and potential gain, which are elements related to the decision reason, the specific calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes are not mentioned. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
For Lottery A, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential difference that 1% could make in the probabilities and decided based on the potentially higher win chance, also considering the maximum risk of staying at 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of win chances and the consideration of the maximum potential loss (staying at 0 Euros), indicating a focus on the probabilities and potential outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes (those with probabilities > 50%), which in this case are both 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, seems to focus on the comparison of win chances and the potential difference a 1% change in probability could make, rather than strictly on outcomes with probabilities above 50%.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual's justification, however, is based on comparing win chances and potential losses, not directly aligning with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages. The verbal report indicates a consideration of win chances and potential losses rather than a strict application of the decision reason's rule regarding probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the only outcome is always probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 0.8, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 0.2, which is lower than 0.5, so it is not considered probable.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros is the only outcome and has a probability of 1, making it a probable outcome.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (4000 * 0.8) / 1 = 3200 Euros, since only the 4000 Euros outcome is probable. For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 3000 Euros, as there is only one outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings and the risk of getting 0 Euros with Lottery A. They mention that the 20% probability of getting 0 Euros was ""nicht gerade wenig"" (not exactly low), indicating concern over this risk. They justify their choice by preferring a ""sicheren, etwas geringerem Gewinn"" (a certain, somewhat lower gain), which refers to choosing Lottery B over Lottery A due to its certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (difference in potential winnings, risk of getting 0 Euros), it appears the individual did consider aspects related to the decision reason, such as the risk associated with Lottery A's outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring certainty over potential higher gain due to risk aversion), it seems the individual's justification aligns more with risk aversion rather than explicitly following the decision reason's rule about averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates consideration of risk and preference for certainty, which aligns somewhat with the implications of the decision reason but does not directly apply the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the concern for risk, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For each lottery, we identify the probable outcomes based on the rule that an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. 
- For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome with 75% probability is considered probable.
- For Lottery B, similarly, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome with 80% probability is considered probable.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have only one probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the difference in probabilities (5% difference) and the appeal of the higher sum, along with the consideration that the worst outcome would have been neutral.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on the preference for the higher sum and the minimal difference in probabilities, along with the neutrality of the worst outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, is 0 for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the difference in probabilities and the appeal of the higher sum, not directly mentioning the concept of probable outcomes or their averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) does not align with the individual’s justification (focusing on the higher sum and the minimal difference in probabilities).
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as it is defined, especially since the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries (as both have an average of probable outcomes equal to 0), and the individual's justification does not reflect this reasoning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B: The outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable.
- For Lottery A: The outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Thus, only the 3000 Euros outcome is considered probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings and the probability of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B, which they found to be significant and relatively high, respectively. They also mentioned being comfortable with the risk of winning 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the significance of the potential winnings and their comfort with the risk, without explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of average probable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on a specific probability threshold. The individual, however, discussed the significance of the winnings and their comfort with risk, not explicitly the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as they do not mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes based on the given probability threshold.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the specified probability threshold. Their justification focuses on different aspects (the significance of potential winnings and comfort with risk), which does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5.
The probable outcomes are 0 Euros for both lotteries. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros.
Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), according to the decision reason, the individual should be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered both winnings as extremely unlikely but thought about preferring the higher sum if they were to have luck.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the preference for the higher sum if they were to win, implying a consideration of the potential winnings despite their low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probable outcomes, which in this case are the 0 Euro outcomes for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration seems to be more on the potential high rewards despite their low probabilities, not directly on the probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference due to both lotteries having the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), but the individual's justification seems to lean towards preferring the higher potential reward, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the potential high rewards and a preference for the higher sum if they were to win, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
7,"mit dem sicheren, aber geringerem Verlust.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. The probable outcome for Lottery A is -4000 Euros with 80% probability. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 or 100%, which is not applicable since the only outcome has 100% probability. The probable outcome for Lottery B is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is -4000 Euros (since only one outcome meets the probability threshold), and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considers the certain loss of Lottery B as smaller than the potential loss of Lottery A and weighs this against the risk of Lottery A, which might result in no loss (0 Euros), though this is deemed very unlikely. The individual decides that the certain, albeit smaller, loss of Lottery B is preferable over the risk associated with Lottery A. The justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the comparison of the certain loss versus the risky loss and the perceived value of avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (certain loss vs. risky loss and the preference for avoiding risk), there seems to be a partial overlap. The individual does consider the magnitude of losses but does not explicitly calculate or compare averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) with the individual’s justification (preferring the certain, smaller loss due to risk aversion), the decision reason and the individual’s justification align in the outcome (preferring Lottery B) but not entirely in the reasoning process. The individual’s focus is more on risk avoidance rather than on comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The assessment is closer to 0 because, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not closely follow the decision reason's criteria of comparing averages of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion and comparing certain versus uncertain outcomes rather than explicitly calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For each lottery, we identify the probable outcomes based on the rule that an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. 
- For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. The probable outcome in Lottery A is 0 Euros with 80% probability.
- For Lottery B, there are also 2 outcomes, so the same rule applies. The probable outcome in Lottery B is 0 Euros with 75% probability.
The decision reason considers the average of these probable outcomes to make a decision. Since both lotteries have only one probable outcome (0 Euros), the average probable outcome for both is 0 Euros. However, to apply the reason fully, we consider the context: the reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both averages are the same (0 Euros), we must consider how the individual might interpret this in the context of the decision problem, particularly focusing on the losses when they do occur.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the principle used before (implying a previous similar decision), the minimal difference made by a 5% probability (which seems to refer to the difference in probabilities of losing between the two lotteries), and the preference for losing less money when a loss is highly probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on the preference to lose less money when a loss seems likely, given that the difference in probabilities (5%) is considered negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have 0 Euros as their probable outcome. However, the individual's focus is on the magnitude of loss when a loss is probable and the negligible difference in probabilities, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's focus but applies it in a nuanced way considering the actual losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), the individual's decision hinges on the preference to lose less when losing is likely, which can be seen as an extension or interpretation of the decision reason in the context of negative outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report suggests an understanding and application of the decision reason's core idea (focusing on probable outcomes) but applies it in a contextually nuanced way, considering the magnitude of losses when losses are probable. The direct application of the decision reason as stated does not differentiate between the two lotteries due to both having the same average probable outcome, but the individual's reasoning about preferring lesser losses aligns with an intuitive extension of the reason in the face of probable negative outcomes. Thus, while the individual's reasoning is not a direct, strict application of the decision reason, it shows an influence or consideration of similar principles, leading to a moderate assessment of the decision reason's use."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the -6000 Euros outcome has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
For Lottery B, the -3000 Euros outcome has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Thus, only the -3000 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros (since only the -3000 Euros outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a larger amount of money at once and the higher probability of losing a smaller amount in the other lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""lesser evil,"" implying they chose the option that, despite involving a loss, was more acceptable in terms of the magnitude of loss and its probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than 50% and calculating their average. The individual, however, discussed the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities in a more general sense, not specifically identifying ""probable"" outcomes as defined by the decision reason or calculating averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, it would prefer Lottery A (average of 0 Euros) over Lottery B (average of -3000 Euros). The individual's justification, however, seems to align with choosing Lottery B because it represents a ""lesser evil"" in terms of the risk and magnitude of loss, which does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason or applied the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher average of such outcomes. Instead, the justification focuses on the risk and magnitude of losses in a way that does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is lower than 0.5, and is not considered probable.
For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is lower than 0.5, and is not considered probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of losses in both lotteries and had difficulty assessing the difference that 0.01% would make. They focused on the high probabilities of not losing (99.99% for Lottery B and 99.8% for Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B, feeling it was the safer option, given the slightly higher probability of not losing (99.99% vs 99.8%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the 0 Euros outcome for both lotteries since only these outcomes meet the probability threshold for being considered probable. The individual, however, focused on the slight difference in the probabilities of not losing, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would not differentiate between them based on the provided probabilities. The individual, however, chose based on the perception of safety related to the slightly higher probability of not losing in Lottery B, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the perception of safety due to the higher probability of not losing, rather than an explicit consideration of the average probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, so it is always considered probable. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are at the threshold of being considered probable (50% probability), but based on the definition given, neither outcome exceeds the 50% threshold to be considered probable in the context of this specific decision reason's application criteria. However, for the sake of evaluating the decision reason's applicability, we consider the calculation of average probable outcomes. Since neither outcome strictly meets the ""higher than 50%"" criterion due to the equal probability, we interpret the decision reason as potentially considering the expected value or a similar metric for evaluation, given the context.
- Lottery A has one outcome: 500 Euros with 100% probability, which is considered probable.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their averages. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, if we were to apply a more lenient interpretation that considers the outcomes due to their equal probability, the average would be (1000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 500 Euros. However, strictly by the decision reason's criteria, neither outcome of Lottery B is probable, suggesting an average of 0 for probable outcomes under a strict interpretation.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to be considering the potential for gain and the risk involved, mentioning the desire to possibly double their gain and the willingness to risk not gaining more in order to have tried for the higher amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for the possibility of a higher gain (doubling the amount) over the certainty of a smaller gain (500 Euros), indicating a willingness to take a risk for a potentially greater reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, while the individual considers the potential for gain and the risk of not achieving it, which aligns more closely with an expected utility or risk assessment rather than a strict adherence to the probable outcomes as defined.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would suggest a preference for Lottery A based on a strict interpretation of the decision reason. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the desire for a higher potential gain and the willingness to risk for it, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests a consideration of risk and potential gain that does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The focus on risk-taking for a higher potential reward and the emotional aspect of ""at least trying"" for the higher amount indicates a decision-making process that does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual in making their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes in Lottery B have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so the outcome is considered probable by default. The probable outcomes for Lottery B are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, the probable outcome is -500 Euros. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -500 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the average of probable outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions being certain about what they would get (implying consideration of the certainty of outcomes in Lottery A) and compares it to the 50% probability of losing in Lottery B, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual found the 50% chance of losing (in Lottery B) unappealing, especially since neither option offered a gain. This suggests the individual was focusing on avoiding loss and possibly the certainty of the outcome in one of the options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (average of probable outcomes) with that considered by the individual (certainty of outcomes, probabilities, and avoidance of loss). While the individual considered aspects related to the decision reason (like probabilities and outcomes), the focus was more on the certainty of loss and the lack of gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding the 50% chance of a significant loss and preferring the certainty of a smaller loss). The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same average probable outcome (-500 Euros), but the individual's justification suggests a preference for the certainty of a smaller loss over the gamble, which aligns with preferring a more predictable negative outcome but doesn't directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the averages of probable outcomes. While the individual considered probabilities and outcomes, the focus on certainty and loss avoidance doesn't directly reflect the application of the decision reason. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcome is 0 Euros because it has a 75% probability, which is higher than 50%.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros because it has a 50% probability, which is higher than 33.33%. 
However, we should note that the decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. Therefore, we also need to consider if there are other outcomes that meet the probability threshold for being considered probable.
- For Lottery A, besides the 0 Euros outcome, there is no other outcome with a probability higher than 50%.
- For Lottery B, besides the 0 Euros outcome, no other single outcome meets the threshold on its own, but we need to consider the combined effect of outcomes in the context of the decision reason’s rule.
The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average value for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something in Lottery B (50% chance of not going away empty-handed) as a positive aspect, indicating they valued the higher chance of receiving any amount of money over the risk of getting nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring a higher chance of winning any amount over risking getting nothing, highlighting the appeal of having a chance to win even if the amount is not the highest possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case, simplifies to considering the outcomes with probabilities higher than the threshold for each lottery. The individual focused on the aspect of having a higher chance of winning something, which aligns with considering the probable outcomes but doesn’t explicitly discuss averaging them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred the lottery that offered a higher chance of winning something, which can be seen as related to but not directly equivalent to the decision reason’s rule about averaging probable outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, while the individual’s focus on having a higher chance of winning something aligns with aspects of the decision reason, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it seems the individual's reasoning process shared some similarities with the decision reason but did not directly apply it as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 
For Lottery A, there are two outcomes: -6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. 
For Lottery B, there are three outcomes: -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability.
The decision reason categorizes an outcome as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. 
For Lottery A, the threshold is 1/2 = 0.5, so only the 0 Euros outcome with 75% probability is considered probable.
For Lottery B, the threshold is 1/3 = approximately 0.33, so only the 0 Euros outcome with 50% probability is considered probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (0 Euros * 1) = 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is also (0 Euros * 1) = 0 Euros, since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable.
Thus, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since both have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. 
The individual mentions the perceived lower probability of losing something with Lottery A and a ""blödes Gefühl"" (bad feeling) about the 50% loss probability with Lottery B, indicating they focused on the risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual's justification seems to be based on avoiding loss, specifically mentioning the discomfort with the high loss probability in Lottery B and hoping to avoid loss with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, does not differentiate between the two lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the risk of loss and the probability of losing, which aligns partially with considering outcomes but not specifically with calculating an average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason would lead to indifference due to equal average probable outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on avoiding loss, particularly the high probability of loss in Lottery B, not directly on comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus and justification do not align with the specific rule of the decision reason, which calculates and compares the average of probable outcomes. The verbal report indicates a decision based on loss aversion and perceived probabilities of loss rather than the defined decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is considered probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1 is not applicable as a threshold here, but by definition, the single outcome is always probable. The probable outcomes are: for Lottery A, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, and for Lottery B, 5 Euros with 100% probability. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome meets the probability threshold), and for Lottery B, it is 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered having a secure gain as a positive aspect, implying they valued the certainty of an outcome. Second, the individual justified their choice by preferring ""the sparrow in the hand"" (a German idiom for preferring a small but certain advantage) over ""the dove on the roof"" (implying something potentially better but less certain), indicating they prioritized the guaranteed outcome over the possibility of a higher but less likely gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (secure gain, certainty of an outcome), there is a match in the sense that the individual focused on the certainty of the outcome, which aligns with considering probable outcomes. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) with the individual's justification (preferring a certain, albeit smaller, gain), there is also a match because the individual essentially chose the option with the ""higher average of probable outcomes"" when considering that Lottery B's certain outcome of 5 Euros is preferred over Lottery A's certain outcome of 0 Euros. The individual's emphasis on certainty and secure gain aligns with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we evaluate whether the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, so it is always considered probable since its probability is 1.0. 
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, because 99.9% is higher than 0.5. The -5000 Euros outcome is not probable since 0.1% is less than 0.5.
- Lottery A has one probable outcome: -5 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss of Lottery A and the low probability of the high loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they did not want to accept a certain loss (from Lottery A) and perceived the risk of the high loss in Lottery B as relatively low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery B is 0 Euros and for Lottery A is -5 Euros. The individual considered the certainty of loss in A and the low probability of a high loss in B, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not directly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B (0 Euros) over Lottery A (-5 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was to avoid a certain loss and because the high loss in B was seen as low risk, which indirectly supports the idea of preferring a scenario with a potentially better outcome but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the specific rule of calculating and comparing the averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. While the individual considered the certainty of loss and the low probability of a high loss, which are elements related to the decision reason, the explicit calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes are not mentioned. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a slight alignment in the consideration of outcomes and their probabilities."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, making both outcomes technically probable, but since they are exactly at the threshold, it may require careful consideration. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery A, both +3000 Euros and -3000 Euros are at the threshold of being considered probable, and for Lottery B, 1500 Euros is the probable outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and compared it to the risk of losing twice the amount they could win in Lottery B when considering Lottery A. They seemed to focus on the risk of loss and the attractiveness of a certain gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring a certain gain over the risk of losing more than they could gain, indicating a risk-averse stance and a preference for accumulating smaller, sure amounts rather than risking what they have for potentially higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual, however, focused more on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred the certain gain, which aligns with preferring a positive outcome but does not explicitly involve calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification and focus do not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes. While the individual does show a preference for a certain gain over a risky option, which could indirectly relate to the decision reason if the certain gain (1500 Euros) is considered a more favorable average outcome compared to the risky option, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1, which is always true since the probability is 1. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Both probabilities are exactly 0.5, which does not exceed the threshold of being higher than 0.5, but since they are equal, we might consider how the individual interprets ""higher than."" However, strictly speaking, neither outcome is probable according to the reason's definition because neither exceeds the 0.5 threshold.
- Lottery B has one outcome: 2000 Euros with 100% probability. This outcome is considered probable.

The relevant information for the decision reason is the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery A, under strict interpretation, there are no probable outcomes because neither outcome's probability exceeds 0.5. For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sum of the potential loss in Lottery A and its probability, indicating they were concerned about the potential loss and its likelihood. They also considered the gain from Lottery B as a good win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over A because the potential loss in A was too high and its chance was also a concern, and they found the guaranteed 2000 Euros from B to be an attractive gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes. The individual considered the potential loss and gain, which aligns with considering outcomes but does not explicitly mention averaging probable outcomes or the specific probability threshold used by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offered a guaranteed gain without the risk of loss present in Lottery A, which does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about averaging probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's concern about the loss and appreciation for the guaranteed gain in Lottery B might superficially align with preferring outcomes based on their probabilities and values, the individual's reasoning does not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific rule about probable outcomes and their average. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual applied the rule of comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the defined probability threshold.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's reasoning process, while considering outcomes and their probabilities, does not clearly align with the specific criteria (probable outcomes and their average) and rule (preferring the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes) outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, both the 3000 Euros outcome and the -3000 Euros outcome have a 50% probability, making both outcomes probable according to the decision reason's definition.
- For Lottery B, there is only one outcome (1000 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. 
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the average of the probable outcome is 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the win in Lottery A but also took into account the risk of a relatively high loss with high probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk aversion, mentioning the principle of ""a bird in the hand"" (Spatzen in der Hand), implying a preference for a certain gain over a risky option, even if the risky option has a higher potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for Lottery A is 0 Euros and for Lottery B is 1000 Euros. The individual considered the risk of loss and the attractiveness of the win, which aligns with evaluating outcomes but does not directly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, emphasizing risk aversion and the principle of a certain gain being preferable, also leads to a preference for Lottery B but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of the risk and potential outcomes, aligning with the general concept of evaluating outcomes, but does not explicitly mention calculating the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's justification for preferring Lottery B (based on risk aversion and the value of a certain gain) matches the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B due to its higher average of probable outcomes) but does not clearly demonstrate the use of the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not clear that the decision reason was directly used, leading to an assessment below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, making them both probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is (6000 Euros - 6000 Euros)/2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average of the probable outcome is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing a high sum of money (6000 Euros) with 50% probability as too risky and seems to focus on avoiding loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing comfort with staying at the current sum (implied to be 0 Euros, as that is the outcome of Lottery A) and views the 50% chance of losing a high sum as too risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is 0 Euros. The individual, however, focuses on the risk of losing a high sum, which aligns with considering the negative outcome of Lottery B but does not explicitly discuss averages or the exact probabilities in terms of ""probable outcomes"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, prefers Lottery A due to risk aversion regarding the potential loss in Lottery B, not explicitly because of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. While the outcome of the decision (preferring Lottery A) could be seen as consistent with risk aversion, the verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the average of probable outcomes as the basis for their decision. The emphasis is on avoiding risk rather than on calculating or comparing averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."
