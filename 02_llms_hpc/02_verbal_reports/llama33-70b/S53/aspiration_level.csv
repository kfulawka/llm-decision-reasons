STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery A, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the positive differences are 675 and 575, occurring with probabilities 33% and 66%, respectively. In Lottery A, the positive difference is 575, occurring with a probability of 100%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that ""1% wird wahrscheinlich nie eintreffen"" (""1% will probably never happen""), indicating they are considering the low probability of the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery B. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states ""also macht man bei B nur Gewinn"" (""thus one only makes a profit with B""), suggesting they believe choosing Lottery B results in a gain, implying they focus on the positive outcomes of Lottery B and possibly overlook or downplay the 1% chance of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, seems to focus on the idea that the 1% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B is negligible and that they will ""only make a profit"" with B, which simplifies the consideration of outcomes but does not directly mention aspiration levels or the calculation of differences from such a level. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A in this case since it offers a 100% chance of a positive difference from the aspiration level (if considering the aspiration level calculated). The individual's justification, however, implies a preference for Lottery B because they expect to make a profit, which aligns more with ignoring the low-probability loss and focusing on the gains, rather than explicitly considering the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from this level as part of their decision-making process. Their focus on the practical outcome of ""only making a profit"" with Lottery B and downplaying the 1% chance of losing does not align closely with the decision reason's emphasis on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility of some indirect influence, hence the assessment is closer to 0 than to suggesting uncertainty or certainty of use."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 2400 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 2500 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (2400 + 0 + 2500 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros, and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros
- For Lottery B: 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros, and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We need to calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery.
- For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 34% (since 2400 Euros is above the aspiration level with 34% probability).
- For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 33% (since 2500 Euros is above the aspiration level with 33% probability).
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and it would prefer Lottery A because it has a slightly higher probability (34% vs 33%) of outcomes above the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report is ""Mehr Geld für quasi die selbe Wahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""More money for almost the same probability.""
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to have considered the monetary outcomes and the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting that one offers more money for roughly the same probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the comparison of outcomes given similar probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on ""more money for almost the same probability."" The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification is based on a simpler comparison of monetary outcomes given similar probabilities, without explicit reference to an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0 because the individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of probabilities of positive differences, which are central to the decision reason. The individual's focus on ""more money for almost the same probability"" suggests a simpler decision-making process that does not align with the specific rule outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros (negative); for Lottery B, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros (positive). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has an 80% chance of a positive difference and a 20% chance of a negative difference, and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report is ""Ez money."" This report is very brief and does not explicitly mention the aspiration level, the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, or the probabilities of positive differences. The report seems to focus on the ease or attractiveness of the money without providing detailed deliberation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, and probabilities of positive differences) with that considered by the individual, it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider these factors in their verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice (""Ez money"") does not align with the decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences based on the aspiration level. The verbal report lacks specific references to the aspiration level, outcome differences, or the probability of positive differences, making it difficult to conclude that the decision reason was used.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: Outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- Lottery A: Outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros.
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 4000 - 1750 = 2250 (positive), and 0 - 1750 = -1750 (negative).
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 1750 = 1250 (positive), and 0 - 1750 = -1750 (negative).
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We need to calculate these probabilities:
- Lottery B has a 20% chance of a positive difference and an 80% chance of a negative difference.
- Lottery A has a 25% chance of a positive difference and a 75% chance of a negative difference.
Given this information, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions ""Ein bisschen mehr Geld für quasi das selbe Risiko, das lohnt sich noch,"" which translates to ""A bit more money for almost the same risk, that's still worth it."" This implies the individual considered the potential gain and the risk associated with each lottery, noting the risk is similar but the potential gain differs.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies the choice based on the additional money being worth the risk, given that the risk is perceived as similar between the two options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the risk and the potential gain, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the option that offers more money for a similar risk, which aligns with preferring a higher potential gain but does not directly address the concept of an aspiration level or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's justification involves considering the potential gain and risk, it does not explicitly mention or imply the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of probabilities of positive differences from such a level as described by the decision reason. However, the emphasis on ""a bit more money"" for ""almost the same risk"" could indirectly relate to the concept of weighing outcomes against some form of baseline or expectation, but it's not a clear application of the decision reason as defined.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there's a vague alignment in considering outcomes and risk, the specific mechanism of the decision reason (aspiration level and preference for higher probabilities of positive differences) is not clearly evident in the individual's verbal report. The justification provided by the individual does not directly align with the detailed process outlined by the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 3000 - 2250 = 750, 0 - 2250 = -2250
- For Lottery B: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""ziemlich sichere 3000 Euro"" (approximately secure 3000 Euros), indicating consideration of the high probability of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual compares ""ziemlich sichere 3000 Euro"" to ""50/50 6000 Euro"", suggesting a preference for the more certain outcome over a 50/50 chance, even though the actual probability for Lottery B is not 50/50 but 45%. The focus is on the certainty of the outcome rather than the exact probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of the certainty of the outcomes indirectly touches upon the idea of comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the more certain outcome, which aligns with preferring positive (or less negative) outcomes but does not directly apply the rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning touches upon the idea of preferring more certain outcomes, which aligns with aspects of the decision reason but does not directly apply the specific rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or considering the probabilities of positive and negative differences from this level, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 3000 Euros, the difference is 750 Euros (3000 - 2250); for 0 Euros, the difference is -2250 Euros (0 - 2250); for 6000 Euros, the difference is 3750 Euros (6000 - 2250); and for 0 Euros, the difference is -2250 Euros (0 - 2250). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.8% probability, and Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability, we can apply the decision reason by comparing the probabilities of outcomes that represent positive differences from the aspiration level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report translates to ""Almost the same chance, maybe double the money, gladly."" This suggests the individual considered the potential for higher reward (double the money) in their decision-making process and seemed to weigh this against the notion of the chances being ""almost the same."" The justification for the choice seems to hinge on the potential for a greater reward without a significant difference in risk perception.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level) with that considered by the individual (the potential for double the money and the similarity in chances), there's a partial alignment. The individual focuses on the potential for a higher reward, which could be related to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level, but the report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level or the specific probabilities of positive differences.

The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification seems to lean towards the higher potential reward without explicitly weighing the probabilities of these outcomes against an aspiration level. Given this, it seems the individual might have intuitively considered aspects related to the decision reason but did not explicitly apply it as defined.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process shares some intuitive alignment with the concept of preferring higher rewards (which could be related to positive differences from an aspiration level), the verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of the specific decision reason as defined, particularly in terms of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is thus calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions risking not losing money and considers 20% a good chance, indicating they are focusing on the possibility of not losing money (0 Euros outcome in Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be motivated by the possibility of avoiding loss, indicating a risk-averse or loss-averse attitude, and views the 20% chance of not losing money as a positive aspect.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus is on avoiding loss and the chance of not losing money, which aligns with considering positive outcomes (in this case, not losing money is seen as a positive outcome).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the lottery that offers a chance, albeit small, of not losing money, which can be seen as preferring a lottery based on the possibility of a positive outcome (not losing).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's justification does align with preferring a lottery based on the possibility of avoiding loss (which could be related to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level), the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The individual's focus on avoiding loss and the mention of a ""good chance"" suggests some alignment with the decision reason's preference for positive outcomes, but the process described does not directly match the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -4000, 0, -3000, and 0, which is (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 1750 with 80% and 75% probabilities respectively for Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a similar chance of losing money but notes a minimal higher chance of losing less money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify the choice based on the comparison of the chances of losing less money, finding it ""okay.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of losing less money could be related to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level, but it is not explicitly stated in terms of aspiration levels or mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 80% probability of a positive difference (0 Euros being a positive difference from the aspiration level of -1750 Euros) compared to Lottery B's 75%. The individual's justification mentions a ""minimal higher chance of losing less money,"" which could imply a focus on minimizing losses rather than directly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is relatively low because, while the individual's focus on losing less money could be tangentially related to the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences, the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply the calculation of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The individual's reasoning seems more intuitive and focused on the direct comparison of potential losses rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -4500 / 4 = -1125 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, it's -6000 - (-1125) = -4875; for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125; for -3000 Euros, it's -3000 - (-1125) = -1875; and for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is -1125 Euros, positive differences occur when the outcome is greater than -1125 Euros, which happens for outcomes of 0 Euros in both lotteries. The probability of getting 0 Euros (a positive difference from the aspiration level) in Lottery A is 10% and in Lottery B is 55%. Therefore, based on the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the idea of ""garantiert etwas abgeben"" or ""guaranteed to give something"" which implies a consideration of certainty or higher probability of getting some amount, even if it's negative, rather than a 50/50 chance of a larger loss. This suggests the individual is weighing the certainty of a smaller loss against the uncertainty of a larger loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to lean towards preferring a guaranteed or more certain outcome, even if it means accepting a loss, over a situation with a higher risk of a larger loss. The mention of ""50/50 das Doppelte"" (50/50 chance of double) implies the individual is considering the risk of a larger loss in one of the options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration seems more focused on the certainty of outcomes and the avoidance of a larger loss, rather than explicitly calculating or considering an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences from it.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification seems to prioritize certainty or the avoidance of a high-risk scenario, which doesn't directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's focus on certainty and risk avoidance shares some intuitive similarity with preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (in the context of the aspiration level), the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's calculation and preference rule. The individual's reasoning seems more heuristic and focused on the avoidance of risk rather than the specific comparison of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as defined, was used by the individual. The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of risk and certainty that does not directly align with the specific calculations and preferences outlined in the decision reason."
10,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; and for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) is 99.8%, and in Lottery B, it's 99.9%. However, to accurately apply the reason, we must consider the specific calculation of positive differences as per the aspiration level, which might not directly align with the simple probability of non-negative outcomes. The key is comparing the probabilities of outcomes that are better than the aspiration level (-2250 Euros), which would be any outcome above -2250 Euros. Both lotteries offer outcomes of 0 Euros, which is above the aspiration level, with different probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied by comparing the probabilities of achieving outcomes better than -2250 Euros in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of winning in Lottery A (0.2%) and implies a focus on the potential loss, stating ""im Zweifelsfall verliere ich nur 3000"" which translates to ""in case of doubt, I only lose 3000."" This suggests the individual considered the probability and the magnitude of potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to hinge on the perceived low probability of winning and the comparative loss (""0.2% ist immer noch sehr unwahrscheinlich""), suggesting a risk-averse or loss-averse attitude rather than a direct comparison of probabilities of outcomes better than an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of outcomes better than this level. The individual's consideration, as expressed, does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of better outcomes based on such a level. Instead, the focus is on the low probability of winning and the magnitude of potential loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly address probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level but rather focuses on the low probability of a win and the comparative loss, indicating a different basis for decision-making.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or a comparison of probabilities of outcomes better than such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The focus on low probability and comparative loss suggests a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes (500, 1000, 0) is (500 + 1000 + 0) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 500 - 500 = 0; for Lottery B, 1000 - 500 = 500 and 0 - 500 = -500. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, there is a 100% chance of a difference of 0 (which is not positive), and in Lottery B, there is a 50% chance of a positive difference of 500. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report ""Lieber ein sicheres, kleines Taschengeld"" translates to ""Rather a safe, small pocket money."" This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize having a guaranteed, albeit smaller, amount of money (500 Euros from Lottery A) over the riskier option (Lottery B), indicating a preference for security.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, seems to focus on the certainty of receiving money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B because it offers a 50% chance of being 500 Euros above the aspiration level. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for a safe, small amount, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s focus on positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level, suggesting that the decision reason based on aspiration levels and positive differences was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: -1000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery A: -500 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 + (-500)) / 3 = -500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: -1000 - (-500) = -500, 0 - (-500) = 500
- For Lottery A: -500 - (-500) = 0
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 
Since the aspiration level is -500 Euros, a positive difference occurs when the outcome is greater than -500 Euros. 
For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 50% (the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery A, it is 0% (since -500 Euros is not greater than -500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual.
The individual mentions a preference for giving up a part of their money voluntarily rather than gambling for the double amount, which implies considering the risk and the potential loss or gain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice.
The individual seems to be averse to the gamble (gamblen) and prefers a certain, though less favorable, outcome, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual.
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's consideration is more about the preference for avoiding risk and the certainty of the outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B because it has a 50% chance of a positive difference (getting 0 Euros), whereas Lottery A has a 0% chance. However, the individual's justification seems to focus on risk aversion rather than the probability of outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that involves calculating aspiration levels and comparing probabilities of positive differences. The individual's focus on risk aversion and preference for certainty over gambling does not directly reflect the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences as defined by the aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions preferring a higher chance of winning something rather than possibly winning more. This implies the individual considered the probabilities of winning and the amounts to be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by expressing a preference for a higher chance of winning, indicating that the probability of winning was an important factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual considered the probability of winning but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers a higher chance of winning something, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly mention the concept of an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the probability of winning aligns with the decision reason's consideration of the probability of positive differences. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it, which are key components of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment indicates that while there are some similarities between the decision reason and the individual's justification, such as considering the probability of winning, the individual does not explicitly mention key components of the decision reason, such as the aspiration level. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there is a slight inclination towards it not being the primary reason due to the lack of explicit mention of its core components."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -4000, and -2000, which is (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000) / 4 = -3000 / 2 = -1500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-1500) = -4500 and 0 - (-1500) = 1500; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-1500) = -2500, -2000 - (-1500) = -500, and 0 - (-1500) = 1500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the loss (""Verlust"") associated with each lottery and compares them for the same probability, indicating they considered the potential losses and their associated probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the loss is lower (""geringer"") in Lottery B compared to Lottery A for the same probability, implying that the magnitude of loss is an important factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, particularly preferring the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focuses on the comparison of losses for the same probability without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason’s rule is based on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual’s justification is based on the comparison of losses for the same probability, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on comparing losses for the same probability and the lack of mention of an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level in their justification suggest that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 5 Euros and 5000 Euros (with 0 Euros as the other outcome for B). The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1685 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then considered. For Lottery A, the difference is 5 - 1685 = -1680 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are 5000 - 1685 = 3315 Euros and 0 - 1685 = -1685 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference, while Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is below the aspiration level). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""5 Euro ist nicht so wichtig"" which translates to ""5 Euros is not so important,"" indicating they may not prioritize the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A highly. Then, they express a preference for ""Lotto spielen,"" which means ""playing the lottery,"" implying they are inclined towards Lottery B due to its potential for a higher reward, despite the low probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be based on the perceived value of the guaranteed outcome versus the potential thrill or benefit of playing the lottery, rather than a detailed calculation of probabilities or aspiration levels.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, considering the probability of positive differences. The individual's consideration, as expressed, does not explicitly mention aspiration levels or the calculation of differences from such a level. They seem to focus more on the subjective importance of the guaranteed outcome and the appeal of playing the lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on the subjective value of the outcomes and the appeal of the lottery, without explicit reference to probabilities of being above an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The verbal report does not indicate a consideration of aspiration levels or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but since the individual's preference for the lottery could implicitly align with seeking higher potential rewards (which might be loosely related to the concept of positive differences), there is some uncertainty.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 = -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67; for Lottery A, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery B has a 99.9% chance of a positive difference (since 0 is considered a positive difference from the negative aspiration level) and Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report translates to ""0.1% will not occur, so rather not lose any money."" This implies the individual considered the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery B and preferred not to lose any money, which aligns with choosing Lottery A. The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the probability of the significant loss in Lottery B and the certainty of a small loss in Lottery A. The justification for the choice is based on avoiding loss, specifically the significant potential loss in Lottery B due to its low probability being considered negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (probability of significant loss and preference for not losing money), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual's focus is on avoiding loss, particularly the significant loss in Lottery B, rather than on the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from this level. The decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences does not directly align with the individual's justification, which is more about avoiding a significant loss due to its perceived improbability rather than comparing probabilities of positive outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding a significant loss, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery B are (3000 - 500) = 2500 and (-3000 - 500) = -3500. For Lottery A, the difference is (1500 - 500) = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A offers a guaranteed positive difference (1000) and Lottery B offers a 50% chance of a positive difference (2500), we need to compare these in the context of the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions not needing much money and preferring a secure win, indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the preference for a secure win over a potentially higher but uncertain gain, suggesting risk aversion or a focus on guaranteed outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) does not directly reference an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences but does indicate a preference for certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the secure win, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed positive outcome but does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on a secure win and not needing much money aligns with risk aversion and a preference for guaranteed outcomes, which could tangentially relate to the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level, comparing probabilities of positive differences, or directly applying the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for certainty, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, leading to a low assessment score."

The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of gaining 2000 Euros (from Lottery A) versus the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 50% probability (from Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by comparing the certainty of a positive outcome (2000 Euros) to the risk of a significant loss (3000 Euros with 50% probability), indicating a preference for avoiding the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration focuses on the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the probabilities of being above or below it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the certain gain over the gamble that includes a significant loss, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly reference the decision reason's specific rule about probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and preferring a certain gain over a risky option with potential for significant loss aligns somewhat with the decision reason's preference for positive outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or considering the probabilities of outcomes relative to this level, which are key components of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the preference for positive outcomes, the decision reason's specific process is not clearly followed, leading to a low assessment score."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 0. This means the aspiration level is 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000, -3000, and 1000 for the respective outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (3000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference (1000 Euros), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report translates to ""Rather guaranteed money than potentially going into minus on my account."" This indicates the individual considered the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome and the potential risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by preferring a guaranteed gain over the risk of a loss, highlighting a preference for avoiding potential negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences, it does reflect a concern for avoiding negative outcomes, which aligns with preferring positive differences from a certain reference point (in this case, not going into debt).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 100% chance of a positive outcome. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B, due to its guaranteed positive outcome, which can be seen as a form of preferring a certain positive difference (1000 Euros) over a risky scenario.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not directly mention the aspiration level or explicitly compare probabilities of positive differences, their justification for choosing Lottery B (preference for a guaranteed gain over potential loss) aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences. However, the lack of direct reference to the aspiration level or probabilities means the alignment is not perfect, leading to an assessment below 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros, -6000 Euros, and 0 Euros for Lottery B's outcomes and Lottery A's outcome, respectively. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is 0, any positive outcome is considered a positive difference. Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference (since its outcome is 0 Euros). Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Der Verlust von 6000 ist zu hoch, lieber sichergehen,"" which translates to ""The loss of 6000 is too high, rather be safe."" The individual considered the potential loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery B and compared it to the safety of Lottery A, which offers 0 Euros with certainty. The justification for the choice seems to focus on avoiding the potential significant loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (potential loss of 6000 Euros and the safety of 0 Euros), it appears the individual focused on the potential downside of Lottery B rather than explicitly calculating or considering the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes avoiding a significant loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of aspiration level and positive differences but does not directly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding a significant loss aligns with a general concern for negative outcomes relative to a reference point (which could be interpreted as an aspiration level), but the verbal report does not demonstrate a clear application of the decision reason's specific rule regarding probabilities of positive differences from the aspiration level. Therefore, while there is a vague alignment with the concept of considering outcomes relative to a reference point, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not evident in the verbal report."
