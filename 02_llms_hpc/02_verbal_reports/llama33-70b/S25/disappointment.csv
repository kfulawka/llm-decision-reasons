STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, making the difference 2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, making the difference 0 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B, indicating they considered the risk of the lowest outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to avoid the 1% chance of winning nothing, implying their decision was influenced by the presence of a zero-outcome risk in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual considered the risk of the lowest outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, which relates to the minimum outcome but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A (difference of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is to avoid the risk of winning nothing, which aligns with preferring a lottery with no risk of the lowest outcome (0 Euros), but does not directly state a comparison of outcome differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision to choose Lottery A because of the risk associated with the lowest outcome in Lottery B indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences as the basis for the decision.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros, and for Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the probability of winning (1% more chance) and the difference in the potential winnings (100 Euros more) when making their decision. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring a 1% higher chance of winning over a 100 Euro higher potential win in Lottery B. The described deliberation process focuses on the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount won, not directly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning and difference in potential winnings) shows that the individual did not explicitly consider the decision reason's key factor (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery). 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and the minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring a higher probability of winning over a higher potential win) indicates that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's justification does not mention or imply considering the differences between the outcomes within each lottery as the basis for their choice.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for this reason includes the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual first compared the outcomes of the lotteries and then considered the probabilities. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it comes without the risk of earning nothing. This suggests that the individual considered the potential for earning nothing (0 Euros) in Lottery B as a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and the risk of earning nothing), it appears that the individual did consider the aspect of risk or the range of outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding the risk of earning nothing) can be seen as indirectly related to preferring a lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, as Lottery A has no risk of earning nothing due to its consistent outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries as the primary reason for the choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 

This assessment reflects a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with some uncertainty. The individual's focus on avoiding risk and the implicit consideration of outcome ranges suggest alignment with the decision reason, but the lack of explicit comparison of outcome differences introduces some doubt."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they felt the 5% difference (in probabilities, as inferred from the context) was too small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery, which is 4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, mentions comparing outcomes but justifies their choice based on a probability difference, not the outcome differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (3000 Euros difference). The individual, however, chose Lottery A and justified this based on the probability difference, not the outcome difference as the decision reason suggests.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the difference in probabilities (5%), not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference, which in this case would be Lottery A because 3000 Euros is less than 6000 Euros. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing the outcomes (""Ergebnisse"") first, then the probabilities (""Wahrscheinlichkeit""). This indicates the individual considered both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other, only the process of comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considered the outcomes but the report does not specify if the comparison of outcomes involved calculating or considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the individual’s justification is not explicitly stated in terms of preferring a lottery based on the differences between outcomes, we cannot directly compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification.

Given the information from Step 3, it appears the individual considered the outcomes but there's no clear indication they specifically focused on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision, nor is there explicit mention of preferring one lottery over the other based on this criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects uncertainty and a slight inclination towards the decision reason not being used, primarily because the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the differences between outcomes as the decision criterion, which is central to the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference, which in this case would be Lottery B because 3000 Euros (difference in Lottery B) is less than 6000 Euros (difference in Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that the chances of winning are very low in both lotteries, and they preferred the lottery with the potentially larger, albeit unlikely, win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it seems the individual did consider the outcomes but focused more on the size of the potential win rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the larger potential win due to low probabilities), it appears the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason provided, as they chose Lottery A over Lottery B despite its larger outcome difference.

Verbal report:
Ich wählte Lotterie B, da ich die Chance verlustfrei zu bleiben wählte

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the chance of remaining ""verlustfrei"" (loss-free), which translates to avoiding a loss. The justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be based on the possibility of not losing any money (0 Euros with 20% probability), even though the report does not explicitly discuss the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (chance of remaining loss-free), there seems to be a partial alignment since avoiding loss can be related to the concept of minimizing the difference between outcomes, but it is not a direct consideration of the outcome differences as specified by the decision reason. The individual's justification focuses on the aspect of not losing, which indirectly relates to the concept of minimizing losses but does not explicitly consider the range of outcomes as the decision reason does. Therefore, the alignment is not perfect. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a related but distinct criterion (avoiding loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there is a conceptual connection between the decision reason and the individual's justification, the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The verbal report suggests the individual was influenced by the idea of avoiding a loss, which is somewhat related to the concept of minimizing outcome differences but does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (3000 Euros) between its maximum and minimum outcomes compared to Lottery A (4000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of losing money (1/5 chance, which translates to 20% probability for Lottery A). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because they prefer a lower probability (1/5 or 20%) of losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probability of losing money, not the outcome differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between outcomes (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the probability of losing money, not the difference in outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the probability of losing money, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the outcomes of each lottery and the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within a lottery. For Lottery A, the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is 0 - (-6000) = 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a smaller difference (3000 Euros) than Lottery B (6000 Euros).

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first compares the outcomes (""Ergebnisse"") of the lotteries and then considers the probabilities (""Wahrscheinlichkeit""). The individual's justification for the choice is not explicitly stated in terms of why Lottery B was chosen over Lottery A, but it's mentioned that Lottery B was selected.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes between the lotteries) with what the individual considered (outcomes and probabilities), it's clear the individual looked at outcomes, which is part of the decision reason's criteria. However, the individual chose Lottery B, which has a larger difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, contrary to what the decision reason would prefer. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the differences between the outcomes as a reason for the choice, which further indicates that the decision reason may not have been the basis for the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report does not specify what information the individual considered when making the decision, only that Lottery A seemed the most sensible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is that Lottery A seemed the most sensible, without explaining why it seemed sensible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The verbal report does not mention considering these differences, so it's unclear if the individual considered this information.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but did not provide a justification that aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual chose the lottery that the decision reason would prefer, but the verbal report lacks specific information about considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries or a justification that aligns with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of this specific decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcomes are 500 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 1000 Euros
- Lottery B: Difference = 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they prefer a certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), we see that the individual did consider the outcomes, which aligns with part of what the decision reason considers. However, there's no explicit mention of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification (preferring a certain gain), we notice that the individual's justification implicitly aligns with the decision reason because Lottery B has a certain outcome (and thus the smallest possible difference between maximum and minimum outcomes, which is 0). However, the individual does not explicitly mention the difference between outcomes as their reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision, but their choice and justification (preferring a certain gain) align with the outcome of applying the decision reason. This suggests that while the decision reason might have been influential, it was not explicitly stated as the basis for the decision, leading to a level of uncertainty. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but without complete certainty."

The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -500 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to take the chance of not making a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered the chance of not making a loss. These considerations are related but distinct; the individual's focus is on avoiding loss rather than directly comparing outcome ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the chance of not making a loss, not directly because of the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has a smaller difference (4000 Euros) between its maximum and minimum outcomes compared to Lottery A (6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery B was chosen because it was associated with less risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the perceived lower risk of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual talks about risk, not the specific differences in outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which aligns with preferring less risk if we interpret less risk as less variability in outcomes. However, the individual does not explicitly mention considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their risk assessment.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because the individual's verbal report does not directly mention the key elements of the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) but rather focuses on the general concept of risk. While the concept of risk could encompass the idea of outcome variability, the direct application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the highest among -4000, -2000, and 0) and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 4000 Euros compared to Lottery B's 6000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not provide a detailed justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A beyond comparing outcomes and probabilities. The choice of Lottery B is stated, but the reasoning behind this choice, based on the provided information, does not explicitly mention the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a deciding factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual chose Lottery B without explicitly stating this reasoning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, we have:
- Lottery A: Difference = 5000 Euros
- Lottery B: Difference = 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions preferring to achieve a win rather than none, which implies consideration of the potential for gaining something (in this case, money) from the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is the preference for achieving a win, without explicitly mentioning the differences between the outcomes of the lotteries or the specific amounts involved.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's stated focus on simply achieving a win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B. However, the individual's justification (preferring to achieve a win) does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of these outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is central to the decision reason. The justification provided focuses on achieving a win, without reference to the specific characteristics that the decision reason deems important.

For Lottery B, the outcome is consistently -5 Euros, meaning the difference is 0 Euros since there's only one outcome. This information is directly derivable from the lotteries' outcomes, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries, indicating they considered both aspects of the decision problem.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred a minimal loss over the small chance of a large loss, indicating a focus on minimizing potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual considered the outcomes but emphasized the preference for minimal loss, which aligns with preferring smaller differences between outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is Lottery B with a difference of 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was to avoid a large loss, which indirectly reflects a preference for the smaller range of outcomes in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on minimizing loss and their comparison of outcomes align with the decision reason's emphasis on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes. While the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating these differences, the preference for minimal loss over a small chance of a large loss implies an implicit consideration of the range of outcomes, suggesting the decision reason was likely used, but not with absolute certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report does not explicitly mention the individual considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries or any specific aspects of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it seemed ""am sinnvollsten,"" which translates to ""the most sensible"" or ""made the most sense,"" but the report does not provide a clear justification related to the specific characteristics of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, but the verbal report does not mention this aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual chose Lottery A without providing a justification that aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries or used a justification that aligns with the decision reason's rule, suggesting that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery (6000 Euros for Lottery B and 0 Euros for Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certainty of achieving a gain (""sicher einen Gewinn erzielen werde""), which implies they considered the aspect of guaranteed outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to ensure they would achieve a gain, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which directly relates to the concept of risk or variability in outcomes. The individual's consideration of achieving a certain gain indirectly touches upon the idea of avoiding risk (since Lottery A has no risk), but they do not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of outcomes between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the certainty of gaining, which aligns with preferring less risk or variability but does not explicitly state that the comparison of outcome ranges was the basis for their decision.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's choice and the decision reason both lead to a preference for Lottery A, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the reason for the choice. However, the emphasis on certainty and avoiding potential loss (implied by choosing a guaranteed gain) suggests an alignment with the principle of minimizing outcome variability, even if not directly stated in terms of comparing outcome ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing outcomes but specifically focuses on the perceived lower value of the second option (1000 Euros) in comparison to an unspecified first option that had a higher value (2000 Euros, though this is not directly relevant to the provided lotteries).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because they perceived the second option (which seems to be a misinterpretation or confusion with the actual options provided) as too low compared to a previous or hypothetical first option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (perceived value comparisons but not directly addressing the range within each lottery), it seems the individual did not directly consider the key aspect of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification (based on a perceived lower value of an option and not directly on the outcome ranges), it appears the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Instead, the report suggests a comparison based on perceived values of outcomes without addressing the specific decision rule of outcome range comparison. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros with 100% probability, meaning the maximum and minimum outcomes are the same (0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 12000 Euros for Lottery B and 0 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the risk of losing 6000 Euros with 50% probability, indicating they considered the potential loss associated with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because they considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros with 50% probability as too great. This implies the individual was focusing on avoiding the potential significant loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss), we see the individual's focus was on the risk of loss, which aligns with considering the negative outcome in Lottery B but does not directly mention comparing the outcome ranges.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) to the individual’s justification (avoiding the risk of significant loss), it appears the individual's decision is consistent with preferring a lottery with less variability in outcomes (Lottery A has no variability), even though the individual does not explicitly state this reasoning in terms of outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on avoiding the significant loss associated with Lottery B and their choice of Lottery A, which has no variability in outcomes, suggests they were influenced by the concept of outcome differences, even if not explicitly stated as such. This indicates a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used, but since the individual does not directly mention comparing outcome ranges, it's not a perfect match. Therefore, the assessment is high but not certain."
