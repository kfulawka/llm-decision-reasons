FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. 
The decision reason is concerned with the maximum probability in each lottery. 
Lottery A has maximum probability of 80% (for -4000 Euros). 
Lottery B has maximum probability of 100% (for -3000 Euros). 
The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 80%
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 100%

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
The reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability.
- The maximum probability for Lottery A: 80%
- The maximum probability for Lottery B: 100%
Since 80% is lower than 100%, Lottery A is preferred based on this decision reason.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason concerns comparing the maximum probability of the outcomes in each lottery.
   - Lottery A has probabilities: 20% and 80%.
   - Lottery B has probabilities: 25% and 75%.
   - The maximum probability for Lottery A is 80%.
   - The maximum probability for Lottery B is 75%.
   - Thus, the relevant information (maximum probability) for each lottery can be derived.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
   - According to the decision reason, we prefer the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability.
   - Lottery A has a maximum probability of 80%.
   - Lottery B has a maximum probability of 75%.
   - The decision reason prefers Lottery B, as 75% is lower than 80%.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: 
Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly to the decision problem. The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery, so we'll derive the maximum probabilities for lotteries A and B.

- For Lottery A:
  Probabilities: 45% and 55%
  Maximum probability: 55% (associated with the outcome 0 Euros)

- For Lottery B:
  Probabilities: 90% and 10%
  Maximum probability: 90% (associated with the outcome -3000 Euros)

Relevant information: Maximum probabilities for Lottery A (55%) and Lottery B (90%).

Step 2: 
Apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability.

- Compare the maximum probabilities:
  - Lottery A: 55%
  - Lottery B: 90%
  
Since 55% < 90%, the reason prefers Lottery A because it has the lower value of maximum probability.
