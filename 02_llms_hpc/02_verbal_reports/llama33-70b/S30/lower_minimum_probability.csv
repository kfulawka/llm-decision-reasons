STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% since it has a 100% chance of a single outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery: 1% for Lottery B and effectively 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries and then chose based on the expected payout, but also mentioned the security of one option being better than the risk of getting nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by stating that security (getting a guaranteed amount) is better than risking getting nothing (even if there's a chance of getting more), specifically mentioning the 1% chance of getting nothing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the risk of getting nothing (1% chance in Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability (which would be Lottery A with its guaranteed payout), and the individual's justification also leans towards preferring the secure option (Lottery A) over the riskier one (Lottery B) due to the potential of getting nothing.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason's focus on minimizing the risk of the worst outcome (0% chance of getting nothing in Lottery A vs. 1% in Lottery B), although the verbal report discusses expected payouts and security more broadly.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason, focusing on the minimum probability of each lottery, influenced the individual's choice, given the emphasis on avoiding the risk of getting nothing. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's justification also discusses expected payouts and the value of security, not solely the minimum probability."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since the outcomes are 33% for 2500 Euros and 67% for 0 Euros, with 0 Euros having the lowest probability), and for Lottery B, it's also 0% (since the outcomes are 34% for 2400 Euros and 66% for 0 Euros). Thus, both lotteries have the same minimum probability of 0%, meaning the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries as both have the same lowest probability of an outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (referred to as ""wkts,"" likely a shorthand for ""Wahrscheinlichkeiten,"" meaning probabilities in German) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete Auszahlung"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery's outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the sums and probabilities but not specifically the minimum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, but since both lotteries have the same minimum probability (0%), it would not differentiate between them based on this rule. However, the individual chose based on the expected payout, not the minimum probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery's outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since it has a 100% chance of a specific outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% (the probability of getting 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (""wkts dazu"" likely refers to probabilities or weights) of the lotteries. They mention taking the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers a safer win (""sicherer gewinn"") over a chance at a higher win, indicating a risk-averse approach but focusing on the expected value rather than the minimum probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on minimum probabilities, but the individual considered expected payouts and the safety of the win, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on the expected payout and the preference for a safer win, not directly on the minimum probability of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described does not align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the minimum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus on expected value and safer wins does not indicate the use of the minimum probability rule as the basis for their decision.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for the 4000 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 3000 Euros outcome). Since the minimum probabilities can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: minimum probability = 20%
- Lottery B: minimum probability = 25%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (erwartete auszahlung).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, as they focused on expected payouts rather than minimum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for the 6000 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, it is 90% (for the 3000 Euros outcome). However, the minimum probability in the context of this reason actually refers to the probability of not winning, which is 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities: 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a lower minimum probability of not winning (or equivalently, a higher minimum probability of winning).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their probabilities (wkts = weights, likely referring to the probabilities of the outcomes). They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout. The mention of ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win) also indicates consideration of the certainty or reliability of the win, even if not as high as possible.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout (erwartete Auszahlung) and the concept of a ""sicheren Gewinn,"" suggesting they prioritized both the potential gain and the likelihood of winning something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of not winning (or the maximum probability of winning), whereas the individual considered the expected payout and the concept of a safe win, which indirectly relates to the probability of winning but is more directly related to the expected value calculation.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of winning (lower probability of not winning), which aligns with preferring a ""sicheren Gewinn."" However, the individual's primary justification is the expected payout, not explicitly the comparison of the minimum probabilities of winning or losing.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined. The focus on expected payout and safe win does not explicitly align with choosing based solely on the minimum probability of not winning. However, there is a slight alignment in the preference for a safer option (higher probability of winning), but this is not the primary criterion mentioned.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's decision, given the verbal report's focus on expected payout and safe win rather than the direct comparison of minimum probabilities of not winning."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 99.8% (the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 99.9% (the probability of getting 0 Euros). However, the decision reason is focused on the minimum probability of the positive outcome, which for Lottery A is 0.2% and for Lottery B is 0.1%. The relevant information for the decision reason is thus the comparison between these probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual first considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their probabilities. The individual then chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, considering the probabilities to be very low anyway and opting for the higher gain in case of luck. The justification for the choice is based on expected payout and the desire for a higher gain due to the low probabilities of winning.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probability of the positive outcome) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities for expected payout), it's clear the individual focused on expected value rather than the minimum probability of winning. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower minimum probability of the positive outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (choosing based on expected payout and desire for higher gain). The individual's process does not directly consider the minimum probability as a deciding factor but rather looks at the overall expected value and the potential for a higher payout.

The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% (associated with the outcome of 0 Euros), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (associated with the outcome of -3000 Euros) since there's only one outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% since it offers a 100% chance of winning 500 Euros. However, since the decision reason is about preferring the lottery with the lower minimum probability, and given that 0% is less than 50%, the reason can technically be applied but seems to be misinterpreted in the context of preferring a sure gain. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery's outcomes, which are 50% for Lottery A and effectively 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries, then the probabilities (wkts), and then chose the lottery with the higher expected payout. The individual also mentions that the sure gain is more valuable and sees no difference from before, implying a preference for certainty.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout and the value of a sure gain, indicating a preference for the lottery that offers a guaranteed amount over one with uncertain outcomes, even if the potential reward is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the expected payout and the value of a sure gain. The individual's focus does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, which would technically be Lottery B due to its 100% chance of winning (or 0% minimum probability of not winning). The individual's justification, however, is based on the expected payout and the preference for a sure gain, which also leads to the selection of Lottery B but for different reasons than the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process and criteria considered by the individual do not match the decision reason's focus on minimum probabilities. The individual's decision is based on expected value and preference for certainty rather than the technical application of minimum probabilities.

The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (associated with both outcomes), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A because 50% is less than 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (""wkts"" likely refers to probabilities or weights), which suggests they considered both aspects of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they choose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"") but also mentions that if it's equal, a smaller loss is better than a chance at a high loss. This indicates the individual considered expected value and the risk of high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome) and 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome), so the minimum probability is 25%. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes) and 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome), so the minimum probability is 25%.

The decision reason can be applied by examining the minimum probabilities of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 25%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, also with a probability of 25%. However, the decision reason focuses on the probability, not the outcome value. Thus, both lotteries have a minimum probability of 25% for their worst outcomes, but since Lottery B also has a -2000 Euros outcome with the same probability, and a 0 Euros outcome with a higher probability, the minimum probability to consider for the worst outcome in both lotteries is indeed 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since it has a 100% chance of winning 5 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (the probability of winning 5000 Euros). However, the minimum probability in the context of the decision reason refers to the lowest probability of any outcome in a lottery, which for Lottery A is 0% (as there's a 100% chance of getting 5 Euros, implying 0% for any other outcome) and for Lottery B is 99.9% (the probability of getting 0 Euros, which is the lowest probability of the two outcomes). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0% (for not getting 5 Euros, which is implicit).
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 0.1% (for winning 5000 Euros, but considering the logic of minimum probability as the lowest chance of any specific outcome, it should be noted the decision reason's application might be misunderstood without clarifying that it refers to the lowest probability of winning, which could imply looking at the 0.1% as the critical figure for the decision reason's direct application).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their probabilities (wkts), aiming to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout. The individual also mentions that since there's no loss and the gain is low, they opt for the chance at the larger sum.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout and the potential for a higher gain, despite the low probability of that gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the expected payout and the potential for a higher gain, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, which would be Lottery A (since 0% is less than 0.1% or considering the logic provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the minimum probability concept as described). The individual's justification, however, is based on expected payout and the desire for a higher potential gain, not on comparing minimum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason as described to make their decision. The individual's focus was on expected value and the potential for a significant gain, rather than the minimum probability of the lotteries' outcomes.

The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (associated with the outcome of -5000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is effectively 0% since there's a 100% chance of getting -5 Euros. However, since the decision reason focuses on the minimum probability and Lottery B has a certain outcome, we interpret this as having a ""minimum probability"" of 100% for its sole outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0.1%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts, likely short for ""Wahrscheinlichkeiten,"" meaning probabilities in German) of the lotteries and aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout. They also considered the risk associated with each lottery, particularly the significant risk of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery A compared to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout and the consideration of risk, particularly the severity of the potential loss. They acknowledge that the expected payouts might be the same but are swayed by the risk of a significant loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, but the individual considered expected payouts and the risk associated with significant losses. There's a mismatch in the focus of the decision reason and the individual's considerations.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, which would be Lottery A with 0.1%. However, the individual's justification is centered around expected value and risk aversion rather than the minimum probability of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not appear to have used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability. Instead, their choice was influenced by considerations of expected value and risk aversion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since both outcomes have 50% probability), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% is not applicable as there is only one outcome with 100% probability, implying the minimum probability considered in this context would be 0%. However, the decision reason's applicability hinges on comparing these probabilities, which can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery: 50% for Lottery B and effectively 0% for Lottery A (since it's a guaranteed outcome).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums/outcomes) and ""die wkts"" (which likely refers to ""Wahrscheinlichkeiten,"" or probabilities), then choosing the lottery with the ""höhere erwartete auszahlung"" (higher expected payout). This indicates the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate expected values.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification is based on the comparison of the expected payouts of the two lotteries, not directly on the minimum probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities for calculating expected value), we see they do not directly align. The individual focused on expected payouts rather than the minimum probability of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the higher expected payout), these are fundamentally different approaches. The decision reason emphasizes the risk aspect (minimum probability), while the individual's approach emphasizes the potential gain (expected payout).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on expected payouts rather than the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, and the justification based on maximizing expected value, indicate that the decision reason considering the minimum probability was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since it has a 100% chance of a single outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has two outcomes, each with 50% probability). Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its minimum probability (0%) is lower than that of Lottery B (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (""wkts"" likely stands for ""Wahrscheinlichkeiten,"" meaning probabilities in German) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete Auszahlung"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, but the individual considered the expected payout, which involves both the outcomes and their probabilities, not just the minimum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the minimum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery based on the expected payout. These are fundamentally different criteria.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is about minimizing the worst-case probability, whereas the individual's justification is about maximizing expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since it has a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Minimum probability of losing = 0%
- Lottery B: Minimum probability of losing = 50%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries, then chose based on the expected payout (erwartete auszahlung).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a certain gain over a chance of loss, implying they chose based on the expected value or the certainty of the gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of losing, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not explicitly discuss minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability of losing, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing a lottery is based on expected payout and preference for certain gain over a chance of loss, not directly on minimum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the minimum probability of losing. The verbal report emphasizes expected payout and certainty, not minimum probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since it has a 100% chance of getting 0 Euros). 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has a 50% chance of getting -6000 Euros). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0% (for the outcome of 0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 50% (for the outcome of -6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries. 
The individual also considered the expected payout (erwartete auszahlung) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, and if the expected payouts are equal, they prefer ""nothing"" (0 Euros) over a chance of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the expected payout and the chance of loss. 
There is no direct mention of comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower minimum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout or no chance of loss if the payouts are equal. 
These two rules do not align, as the individual's justification does not directly involve comparing minimum probabilities.
