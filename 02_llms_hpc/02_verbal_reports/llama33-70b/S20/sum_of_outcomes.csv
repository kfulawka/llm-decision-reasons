STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the given lotteries, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions looking at all options and focusing on the winning options of Lottery A. This implies they considered the potential outcomes of both lotteries but paid particular attention to the higher outcome in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a possibility of winning more than Lottery B, with a very low probability of winning nothing. This justification focuses on the potential for higher winnings and the low risk of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the potential outcomes, especially the higher outcome in Lottery A, and the low risk of winning nothing). The individual's focus was more on the potential for higher winnings and the risk of not winning, rather than the sum of all outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (potential for higher winnings and low risk of getting nothing). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries but rather focuses on the potential benefits and risks associated with each.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason specifically involves calculating and comparing the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the potential for higher winnings and the low risk of winning nothing, indicating a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 Euros + 0 Euros = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros + 0 Euros = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the monetary values of the prizes. This information is: Lottery A has a total outcome sum of 2500 Euros and Lottery B has a total outcome sum of 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the similarity between the options, the difficulty of calculating expected values mentally, and the probability of winning something in each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by preferring the lottery with a higher probability of winning something, given that the winning amounts are similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the total outcome sums of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (similarity of options, difficulty of calculating expected values, and probability of winning). The individual did not explicitly mention considering the sum of outcomes of each lottery.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of winning something because the winning amounts are similar). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason does not consider probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical expectation of the winnings and the probability of winning (80% for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher mathematical expectation of the winnings and a relatively high probability of winning (80%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered the mathematical expectation (which involves probabilities) and the probability of winning. There is a mismatch in the type of information considered.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on the mathematical expectation and probability, not the sum of outcomes. The individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum (4000 Euros) than Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions recognizing a parallel to another task with corresponding loss amounts and probabilities but does not specify how this influenced their decision directly. They also mention looking at the options multiple times, suggesting they considered the details of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed the expected gain (erwartbare Gewinn) was higher. This implies they considered the probabilities and outcomes in a manner that accounts for expected value, not just the sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes, while the individual considered the expected gain, which incorporates both outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected gain. These are different criteria, as the expected gain takes into account the probabilities of the outcomes, not just their sum.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason as described, which solely considers the sum of outcomes independent of their probabilities. Instead, the individual's justification is based on expected gain, which suggests a consideration of both outcomes and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum than Lottery B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the expected value (Gewinnerwartung) of both lotteries and noted they are equal. This implies the individual looked at the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the higher probability of winning something in Lottery B, not on the sum of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value and probability of winning), it appears the individual did not focus on the sum of the outcomes as the decision reason does. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery B due to a higher probability of winning), it is clear the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
6,"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by calculating the sum of all outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since the 0 Euro outcome is not added as it does not contribute to the sum), and for Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the expected value of the winnings for both lotteries and noted they are equal. They then focused on the probability of winning any amount and chose Lottery A because it offers a higher probability of winning, even though the amount is smaller. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on maximizing the chance of receiving any winnings, given the very low probabilities of winning in both lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with what the individual considered (expected values and probabilities of winning), it's clear the individual did not directly consider the sum of all outcomes as per the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice was based on the probabilities of winning and the desire to maximize the chance of receiving any amount, not on the sum of the outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning any amount).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -3000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all possible gains (or losses, in this case) in sequence, considered the expected gain of Lottery B (noting it was lower than that of Lottery A), and weighed the options multiple times before making a decision. They were influenced by the mathematical expectation of gain and the risk of losing more with Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because its expected gain was higher (or loss was lower) and the risk of losing an additional 1000 Euros with Lottery B was too high, despite the 20% chance of losing nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected gain, risk of losing more), it seems the individual focused more on the expected outcomes and the risk associated with each lottery rather than the simple sum of outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on expected gain and risk), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The decision reason would suggest preferring Lottery A because -3000 is greater than -4000, but the individual's reasoning was based on expected value and risk assessment, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on expected gain, risk, and the comparison of potential losses rather than the sum of all outcomes independent of their probabilities indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both sums are negative, it will prefer the one that is less negative, which is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all options, looked at the loss amounts and their probabilities, and thought about the expected losses.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a lower expected loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts, probabilities, and expected losses). The individual considered probabilities and expected losses, not just the sum of outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum, or less negative in this case) to the individual’s justification for the choice (lower expected loss). The decision reason's rule does not match the individual's justification, as the individual focused on expected losses, which involve probabilities, not just the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. Since -3000 is greater than -6000, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing something in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of losing something (i.e., the probability of the negative outcome) is perceived as lower in Lottery A. This perception seems to be based on a misunderstanding since the probability of losing (getting -6000 Euros) in Lottery A is 45%, and the probability of losing (getting -3000 Euros) in Lottery B is 90%, but the individual's focus is on the existence of loss rather than its magnitude or the overall probability of any loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, while the individual considered the probability of losing in each lottery. These are different focuses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B in this case), while the individual chose Lottery A based on a different criterion (perceived lower probability of losing). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -6000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery: -6000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the parallel to a previous decision, the expected value being the same for both lotteries, and the low probability of losing in both lotteries. They also considered the magnitude of the potential loss in the unlikely event of losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, in the unlikely event of losing, the amount to be lost is less. They found the decision difficult.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the magnitude of potential loss and the low probability of losing, but not the sum of all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative), which would be Lottery B (-3000 Euros) over Lottery A (-6000 Euros). The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the smaller loss in the event of losing, which aligns with preferring a less negative outcome but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s rule of summing all outcomes independent of their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's rule of summing all outcomes independent of their probabilities. While the outcome of choosing Lottery B aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (due to its less negative outcome sum), the verbal report indicates the decision was based on the comparison of potential losses in the event of losing, not the sum of all outcomes. This suggests that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 1000 Euros + 0 Euros = 1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and the expected gain of both lotteries, noting they are equal.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it provides a certain gain, despite acknowledging that the expected gains of both lotteries are equal.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and expected gains). The individual does not mention comparing the sum of outcomes of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the certain gain). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher sum of outcomes (1000 Euros vs. 500 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A for a different reason (certainty of gain).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is -1000 Euros + 0 Euros = -1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is -500 Euros. Since the sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a total outcome sum of -1000 Euros and Lottery B has a total outcome sum of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything with Lottery A and viewed the potential loss of 1000 Euros in Lottery A as less severe compared to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B, indicating they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because there's a chance to lose nothing and perceived the potential loss of 1000 Euros as less significant compared to a guaranteed loss of 500 Euros, suggesting a focus on the potential to avoid loss and relative perception of loss severity.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-1000 Euros for A, -500 Euros for B), but the individual's consideration involves the probability of outcomes and the relative severity of losses, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B since -500 Euros is greater than -1000 Euros), but the individual's justification is based on the chance to avoid loss and the perceived severity of the losses, not the total sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the sum of its outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same total outcome sum, which is 6000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all possibilities, looked again at the options provided by Lottery A, and thought about the expected gain (erwartbare Gewinn) being the same. They also considered the probability of winning (Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing a lottery was based on the expected gain being the same and the desire to choose the lottery with a higher winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual. Instead, the individual talks about expected gain and probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, it would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification is based on expected gain and the probability of winning, not the sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves comparing the sum of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities to make the decision. The individual's focus was on expected gain and winning probabilities, which aligns with a different decision-making rationale.

For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 - 2000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the options, recognized a parallel to another task, and thought about the potential losses and the probability of losing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual was deterred by the higher loss amount in one of the options and preferred a higher probability of losing a lower amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (options, parallels to another task, potential losses, and probabilities): The individual's considerations do not directly mention the sum of the outcomes of each lottery, which is the key factor in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum or being indifferent if the sums are equal) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the probability of losing and the amount of loss): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes the probability and amount of loss rather than the total sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 5 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 5000 Euros + 0 Euros = 5000 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (5000 Euros vs. 5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the options, remembered a similar decision task, noted the expected value, the difference in potential winnings, and the low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A for its certainty of winning, given the very low probability of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual discusses expected value, probability, and the certainty of winning, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes (Lottery B), but the individual prefers Lottery A due to its certainty, not because of the sum of its outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -5000 + 0 = -5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery B since -5 is greater than -5000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible winnings of both lotteries, the expected value of the winnings (-5€ for both), the low probability of winning -5000€ in Lottery A, and the certainty of losing 5€ in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid the certainty of losing 5€ in Lottery B, considering the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration. Instead, the individual discusses probabilities and expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on avoiding a certain loss, not the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 1500 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to this reason, Lottery A would be preferred because it has a higher outcome sum (1500 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (Erwartungswert) of the lotteries and the risk of losing 3000 Euros. 
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because its expected value is higher and to avoid the risk of losing 3000 Euros, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered expected values and risk, not the sum of outcomes directly.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, but the individual's justification is based on expected value and risk aversion, not the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on expected value and risk aversion to justify choosing Lottery A does not match the decision reason's criterion of preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes independent of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is simply 2000 Euros since there is only one outcome. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an outcome sum of 0 Euros and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (Gewinnerwartung) of Lottery A, which they calculated to be 0 Euros, and the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery B. They also considered the potential high reward of 3000 Euros from Lottery A but noted the risk of losing 3000 Euros.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certainty of gaining 2000 Euros over the potential higher gain of 3000 Euros from Lottery A, due to the risk associated with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual focused on the expected value and the certainty of the outcomes rather than the simple sum of outcomes. The decision reason specifically looks at the sum of all possible outcomes without considering probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of expected value and risk.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty over potential higher gain due to risk), it's clear that the individual's decision was based on the certainty of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery A, not the sum of the outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the given lotteries, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has an outcome sum of 0 Euros and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, which is 0 Euros, and compared it to Lottery B. They also considered the security of gaining 1000 Euros with Lottery B versus the chance of gaining 3000 Euros with Lottery A, along with the 50% risk of losing 3000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the security of gaining 1000 Euros over the risky option of Lottery A, which has an equal chance of winning or losing. They also mentioned that mathematically, Lottery B is the better choice due to its positive guaranteed outcome compared to the zero expected value of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor. The individual instead talks about expected values and the security of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value and the preference for security, not the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the sum of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities as the basis for their decision. Instead, they focused on the expected value and the security of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as specified, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + (-6000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the expected value of both lotteries and the potential loss. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is to avoid losing something, which led to choosing Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected value and potential loss), it appears that the individual did not focus on the sum of outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (avoid losing something), it is clear that the individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule since both lotteries have the same outcome sum of 0 Euros according to the decision reason, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (avoiding loss).
