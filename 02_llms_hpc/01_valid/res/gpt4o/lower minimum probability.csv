lower minimum probability
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The decision reason requires identifying the minimum probability of each lottery.
   - For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33%, 66%, and 1%. The minimum probability is 1%.
   - For Lottery B, the only probability is 100%. The minimum probability is 100%.
   - The relevant information (minimum probabilities) can be derived.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability is preferred.
   - Lottery A has a minimum probability of 1%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.
   - Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A, as 1% is lower than 100%.

"STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
- The decision reason specifies a rule that depends only on the minimum probability of obtaining any outcome in the lotteries.
- Lottery A outcomes and probabilities: 
  - 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability
  - 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B outcomes and probabilities: 
  - 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability
  - 0 Euros with 99.8% probability
- For Lottery A, the minimum probability of any outcome is 0.1% (for 6000 Euros).
- For Lottery B, the minimum probability of any outcome is 0.2% (for 3000 Euros).

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- The reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of minimum probability.
- The minimum probability for Lottery A is 0.1%.
- The minimum probability for Lottery B is 0.2%.
- Since 0.1% is less than 0.2%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- Lottery A outcomes with their probabilities: 
  - 4000 Euros with 80% probability
  - 0 Euros with 20% probability
- Lottery B outcomes with their probability:
  - 3000 Euros with 100% probability

The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery.
- For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (the probability of 0 Euros).
- For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (the probability of -3000 Euros).

All relevant information is derived, so we proceed to Step 2.
