**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

- The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 
- A favorable outcome is typically defined as an outcome with a non-negative value or an outcome that is better than the worst possible outcome.

For Lottery A:
- The outcomes are -1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability.
- The favorable outcome here is 0 Euros, which has a probability of 50%.

For Lottery B:
- The outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability.

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.**

The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of obtaining favorable outcomes. A favorable outcome is typically considered as receiving any positive monetary amount. We need to identify these outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries.

- **Lottery A:**
  - 6000 Euros with 25% probability (favorable outcome)
  - 0 Euros with 75% probability (not a favorable outcome)

- **Lottery B:**
  - 4000 Euros with 25% probability (favorable outcome)
  - 2000 Euros with 25% probability (favorable outcome)
  - 0 Euros with 50% probability (not a favorable outcome)

For Lottery A, the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (6000 Euros) is 25%.

For Lottery B, the probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (either 4000 Euros or 2000 Euros) is the sum of the probabilities of these outcomes: 25% (4000 Euros) + 25% (2000 Euros) = 50%.

The relevant information derived from the lotteries is:
- Lottery A has a 25% probability of a favorable outcome.
- Lottery B has a 50% probability of a favorable outcome.

Since the relevant information can be derived, we proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 

- Lottery A has a 25% probability of a favorable outcome.
- Lottery B has a 50% probability of a favorable outcome.

Since Lottery B has a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome compared to Lottery A, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.
