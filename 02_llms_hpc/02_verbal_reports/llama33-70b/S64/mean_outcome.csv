STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean is 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because 1633.33 Euros is greater than 2400 Euros is not true, the mean of Lottery A (1633.33) is actually less than the outcome of Lottery B (2400), but since the decision reason is based on the mean of outcomes without considering probabilities, and given the specific numbers, Lottery A's mean (1633.33) is less than Lottery B's single outcome (2400), indicating a potential misunderstanding in the initial comparison. The correct comparison should note that Lottery A's calculated mean (1633.33) is indeed less than Lottery B's outcome (2400), suggesting the decision reason would prefer Lottery B if strictly following the mean calculation without considering probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it has a guaranteed win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean of the outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the guaranteed win of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the guarantee of the win, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on calculating the mean of outcomes, which is not mentioned in the report. Instead, the individual's choice is justified by the guarantee of winning in Lottery B, indicating a different decision-making criterion. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason is the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) and the possible gain. Specifically, they noted that Lottery B had a 1 percentage point lower probability of winning nothing and a possible gain 100 Euros higher than Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparison of probabilities of not winning and the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which depends on the outcomes themselves, not their probabilities. The individual, however, considered the probabilities and the difference in potential winnings, not the mean outcomes directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes but rather focuses on the difference in potential winnings and probabilities of not winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on probabilities and the difference in potential winnings does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean outcome is 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because 3000 Euros is greater than 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to have considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B and compared it with the possible win of Lottery A, noting that despite the higher possible win in Lottery A, they chose B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be based on the preference for a guaranteed win over a probabilistic higher win, as indicated by ""trotzdem B"" which implies ""still chose B"" despite the potential for a higher win with A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which doesn't directly match the individual's focus on the guaranteed vs. possible wins.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery B), and the individual chose Lottery B but based their justification on the guarantee rather than the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the guarantee of Lottery B over the potential higher payout of Lottery A, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of choosing based on the mean outcome of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all the information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") but concludes that both lotteries are quite similar (""da beide Lotterien ziemlich ähnlich""), without specifying which aspects they considered for this conclusion.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to imply a random selection (""Zufallsauswahl"") due to the perceived similarity between the two lotteries, without providing a clear justification based on specific criteria like outcomes or probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered all information but found the lotteries similar without specifying the criteria for this assessment.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, while the individual's justification is based on a perceived similarity between the lotteries, leading to a random choice. There is no indication that the individual calculated or considered the mean outcomes as described by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The report suggests a different approach, focusing on the overall similarity of the lotteries and leading to a random choice, without mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes as the basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of the winnings and the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting that Lottery B's win is half as large as Lottery A's but has twice the probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the lower potential win, the probability of winning is twice as high, and since the game is played only once, this higher probability is preferred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the mean of the outcomes, disregarding probabilities. In contrast, the individual considered both the magnitude of the winnings and their probabilities, not just the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A (mean of 3000 Euros) over Lottery B (mean of 1500 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the balance between the win amount and its probability, not the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason calculates and compares the mean outcomes of the lotteries without considering probabilities, whereas the individual's choice was influenced by both the magnitude of the potential win and its probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the low probability of winning in both cases (1 in 1000 vs 2 in 1000). Second, the individual justifies the choice by mentioning the possibility of a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn,"" which translates to ""possibly double as high of a win."" This indicates the individual is comparing the potential winnings, focusing on the higher possible gain in one of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential winnings), we see that the individual does consider the potential winnings but does not explicitly calculate or mention the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. However, the focus on the possibility of a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn"" suggests an implicit comparison of the outcomes. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the possibility of a higher win), there is a conceptual alignment in prioritizing the higher potential gain, but the individual's approach is not explicitly based on calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with the general direction of preferring a higher potential gain, the specific method of calculating mean outcomes as outlined in the decision reason is not explicitly followed or mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the comparative potential winnings and their probabilities rather than a calculated mean outcome. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there is a slight inclination to believe it might have influenced the decision indirectly due to the focus on higher potential gains."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean outcome is -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because -3000 is greater than -2000. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number, which can be derived from the given problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all the information and specifically notes that with Lottery A, there's at least a chance (1 in 5, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the 20% chance of winning 0 Euros) to not lose anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of the chance to not lose anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the chance of avoiding loss, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus is on the probability of avoiding loss rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros vs. -2000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery B should be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their mean values.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount and its probability, noting that the loss in Lottery B is smaller but also somewhat more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, even though it's slightly more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered the size of the loss and its probability, not explicitly the mean of all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which is Lottery B in this case), and the individual also chose Lottery B but based on the smaller loss being more acceptable despite a slightly higher probability, not explicitly due to the mean outcome.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the perceived smaller loss and its probability, not the calculation of mean outcomes as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the choice made by the individual aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process and justification provided in the verbal report do not directly indicate the use of the decision reason's specific criteria (mean outcome calculation). The alignment in choice but divergence in reasoning process leads to a low but not zero assessment, as there's a slight possibility that the individual intuitively considered aspects that align with the decision reason without explicitly stating so."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -1500 is greater than -3000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) in both lotteries, noting that the possible loss in Lottery B is double that of Lottery A, but the possibility of winning 0 Euros is higher in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B, seemingly weighing the higher potential loss against the higher probability of getting 0 Euros, but the exact reasoning is not clearly aligned with calculating mean outcomes or directly comparing losses and gains in a manner that matches the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (possible loss and probability of winning 0 Euros): The individual does not seem to consider the mean outcome of each lottery as described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (considering the balance between potential loss and the probability of 0 Euros): The individual's justification does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the mean of all outcomes regardless of their probabilities.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery B is preferred. The information relevant to this decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the loss amount and the risk (probability of loss) of each lottery. They note that the loss in Lottery B is half that of Lottery A but comes with double the risk.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the loss, although coming with double the risk, is only half as high as in Lottery A. This suggests the individual is comparing the magnitude of potential losses and their associated risks.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries and their number) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts and their probabilities): The individual does consider the outcomes (specifically, the loss amounts) but also heavily weighs the probabilities, which the decision reason ignores.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated without considering probabilities) to the individual’s justification (considering both the loss amount and its probability): The individual's justification involves a more nuanced consideration of both loss amount and risk, not merely comparing mean outcomes without regard to probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, as the individual considers probabilities and a more nuanced comparison of risks and outcomes, not just the mean of the outcomes.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-500) / 1 = -500. The information relevant to the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same mean outcome when calculated in this manner.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery A, which indicates they are aware of the outcomes of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the aspect of having ""at least a chance to not lose anything"" with Lottery A, which suggests the individual values the potential to avoid loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are the same for both. However, the individual's consideration is about the possibility of not losing, which does not directly relate to calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome, the reason would be indifferent.

For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the given data.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and its probability, focusing on the fact that the possible loss in Lottery A is smaller, even though the loss is more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller, indicating a risk-averse or loss-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean of all outcomes, while the individual considered the magnitude of possible losses and their probabilities. These are not directly aligned, as the individual's focus was more on the risk aspect rather than calculating a mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery A), which aligns with the individual's choice. However, the justification provided (focusing on the smaller possible loss) does not directly reflect the calculation of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on the smaller possible loss, despite its higher probability, suggests a different consideration than the mean outcome calculation.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (-5 > -2500). The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential loss of Lottery B and its low probability, comparing it to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high loss, although significant, is very unlikely compared to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, calculated without considering probabilities. In contrast, the individual's decision-making process emphasizes the probability of the high loss in Lottery B, indicating a consideration of risk that goes beyond mere mean outcome calculation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A due to its less negative mean outcome. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the low probability of the significant loss, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of ignoring probabilities when calculating mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated without considering probabilities. The individual's consideration of the probability of the high loss in Lottery B and the comparison of this risk to the guaranteed loss in Lottery A indicates a different decision-making approach. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the calculation of their mean.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, the gain is guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the gain is guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed gain of Lottery A): The individual's consideration does not directly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries. Instead, the focus is on the guaranteed nature of the gain in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (guaranteed gain): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the calculation of mean outcomes or the comparison of these means between the lotteries. The decision is based on the guarantee of the outcome in Lottery A, not on the mean outcome calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on the guaranteed gain in Lottery A does not reflect the consideration of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros with 100% probability, so the mean outcome is 2000 Euros. Since Lottery A has a higher mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of a win (""garantiertem Gewinn"") when choosing Lottery A. This implies they looked at the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of the guaranteed win, suggesting that the certainty or the positive guaranteed outcome was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which involves calculating an average of all possible outcomes. The individual, however, focused on the guarantee of a win, which does not directly imply a calculation of mean outcomes across both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was the guarantee of a win, not explicitly the comparison of mean outcomes between the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which calculates and compares mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculated mean of all possible outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain, while Lottery A has a possible loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a gain, unlike Lottery A where a loss is possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual focused on the guaranteed gain of one lottery and the potential loss of the other. These are different perspectives.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on the guarantee of a gain, not explicitly on the mean outcome. The individual’s justification does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, as it does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on guaranteed gain versus potential loss does not reflect the calculation of mean outcomes independent of their probabilities, which is central to the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is not explicitly stated in detail but mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and the possibility of a win with Lottery A (""Gewinn möglich"").
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on the possibility of a win with Lottery A (""darum A""), implying that the potential for a positive outcome was a key factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it seems the individual focused more on the presence of a potential win rather than calculating means.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification, there's no indication that the individual calculated or considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. The individual's decision seems to be based on the presence of a potential win rather than a calculated mean.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the conclusion that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The decision reason involves calculating the mean of outcomes, which is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be based on the potential for a win, which does not align with the decision reason provided."
