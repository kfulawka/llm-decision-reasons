STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% for the outcome of 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% for the outcome of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, which are 100% for Lottery A and 1% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B had a very low probability of resulting in 0 Euros and that the possibility of gaining (implied by ""die möglichen 100€"") was not entirely unlikely. This suggests the individual was aware of the probabilities and outcomes but focused on the low probability of loss and the potential gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had ""zumindest keine Verluste"" (at least no losses) is a misunderstanding since Lottery B does have a loss condition (0 Euros), but the statement likely refers to the high probability of not losing (in the sense of not getting 0 Euros). The justification seems to hinge on the low probability of the worst outcome and the presence of potential gains, rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 1% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discussed the low probability of the worst outcome in Lottery B and the potential for gain, not explicitly comparing the minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems to prioritize the low risk of the worst outcome in Lottery B and its potential gains, not directly aligning with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the minimum probabilities of the lotteries. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its 100% minimum probability, whereas the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not reflect a consideration of the minimum probabilities as defined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a minimum probability of 0% (since the 0 Euros outcome has a 66% probability) and Lottery B also has a minimum probability of 0% (since the 0 Euros outcome has a 67% probability). However, since both lotteries have the same minimum probability of 0%, we need to look at the actual probabilities of the non-zero outcomes. Lottery A has a 34% probability of winning 2400 Euros, and Lottery B has a 33% probability of winning 2500 Euros. The decision reason can be applied by comparing these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the sizes of the lotteries (100 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1 percentage point).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risk-friendly option), implying they chose the lottery with the higher potential reward, despite the slightly lower probability, because the difference in probabilities was not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, but since both lotteries have a 0% minimum probability for the worst outcome, the comparison shifts to the probabilities of the positive outcomes. The individual considered the difference in probabilities but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of winning as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a slightly higher probability (34% vs 33%) of winning a significant amount, but the individual's justification was based on the risk-friendliness of the option and the perceived small differences in both outcome size and probability, not explicitly on which lottery had the higher probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning. The individual's focus was more on the risk aspect and the perceived small differences between the lotteries rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of winning. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 100% (since it's a guaranteed outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability of winning is 80% (the probability of winning the €4000). The relevant information for the decision reason is thus:
- Lottery A: Minimum probability = 100%
- Lottery B: Minimum probability = 80%
Since Lottery A has a higher minimum probability, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the aspect of security (Sicherheitsbedürfnis) and the feeling of not wanting to gamble with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially since the sums involved are relatively high.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to be centered around the desire for security and not wanting to risk losing with the 20% chance in Lottery B, implying a preference for a safer option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning for each lottery, while the individual seems to focus on the aspect of security and the risk associated with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B. Although the individual does not explicitly mention probabilities, their concern about the risk (20% chance of not winning) implies an awareness of the probability aspect, albeit not directly framed as ""minimum probability.""

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (which would be Lottery A), and the individual's justification for choosing a lottery (implied to be Lottery A, based on the context of preferring security and avoiding the risk associated with Lottery B) aligns with preferring a safer, more secure option, which corresponds to the lottery with the higher minimum probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that while the individual does not explicitly state the decision reason's rule, their justification and the factors they considered (security, risk aversion) are consistent with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its higher minimum probability). However, the individual's reasoning is not explicitly framed in terms of minimum probabilities but rather in terms of risk aversion and security needs.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification (focusing on security and risk aversion) and the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability), but it is not a perfect match since the individual does not explicitly mention the concept of minimum probability."
4,"bei Lotterie B angelockt, da Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied von 5% nicht so groß erscheint

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 75% (0 Euros) and for Lottery B, it is 80% (0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability, which in this case would be Lottery B because 80% is higher than 75%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B and the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries (5%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the potential higher gain and the perceived small difference in probabilities, rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probabilities, but the individual's consideration is on the potential gain and the difference in probabilities, not directly on the minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The focus is on potential gain and the difference in probabilities rather than the minimum probabilities themselves. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
5,"bschreckend, dass es unter 50% waren

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (the probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 55% (the probability of winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the worst-case scenario (winning 0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery A as very appealing. Additionally, the individual was deterred by the fact that the probability of winning in Lottery B was below 50%. The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the attractiveness of the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the unattractiveness of the low winning probability in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of winning 0 Euros) with that considered by the individual (high probability of winning in Lottery A and the low winning probability in Lottery B), there is a match in the focus on probabilities, although the individual's reasoning seems to be more about the attractiveness of high probabilities of winning rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the worst-case scenarios. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning (which would be Lottery A due to its higher probability of the positive outcome), and the individual's justification aligns with preferring Lottery A due to its high probability of winning. While the individual does not explicitly state a comparison of the worst-case probabilities, their focus on the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the low overall probability in Lottery B suggests an implicit consideration of the probabilities that aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher minimum probability of a positive outcome.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of winning (0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of winning is extremely low (""verschwindend gering"") for both options, suggesting they considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual feels it's relatively indifferent (""relativ egal"") because of the low probabilities and decides to go for the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn""), implying their choice is based on the potential gain due to the perceived indifference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, which the individual acknowledges as being very low but does not directly compare or mention preferring one over the other based on this criterion.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning (which would be Lottery A with 0.2% probability), but the individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher gain due to the perceived indifference in the low probabilities, not explicitly on the comparison of the probabilities of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests an awareness of the low probabilities but does not explicitly indicate that the decision was based on comparing and preferring the higher minimum probability of winning. The focus on the higher gain due to indifference in probabilities does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on the minimum probability. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."
7,"icht-Verlust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since it's a certain outcome), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 80% (the probability of losing -4000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these minimum probabilities. Since Lottery A has a 100% probability of losing -3000 Euros and Lottery B has an 80% probability of losing -4000 Euros, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its higher minimum probability (100% > 80%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss in both lotteries and the probability of no loss (20% in Lottery B) versus the certain loss in Lottery A. They seem to weigh the attractiveness of avoiding a loss against the magnitude of the potential loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by indicating that the 20% chance of avoiding a loss in Lottery B does not outweigh the additional €1000 loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A. This implies they are considering the trade-off between the probability of outcomes and their values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key consideration. The individual discusses probabilities and outcomes but not in the context of identifying and comparing minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual's justification also leads to preferring Lottery A but based on a different rationale (comparing the potential loss and the probability of avoiding loss rather than directly comparing minimum probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on minimum probabilities, even though the outcome preference (preferring Lottery A) coincidentally matches. The verbal report suggests the individual considered different aspects (trade-offs between loss amounts and probabilities of avoiding loss) than the decision reason (minimum probabilities). Therefore, while the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (probability of losing 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 20% (probability of losing 4000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these minimum probabilities. Since Lottery A has a higher minimum probability (25%) than Lottery B (20%), according to the decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the impact of the 5% difference (which likely refers to the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries) and the size of the potential loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the smaller loss amount, implying they chose Lottery A because the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery B seemed too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities. Instead, the individual discusses the difference in potential losses and the impact of the probability difference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A but based their decision on the size of the potential loss rather than the probability of the loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on minimum probabilities. While the individual chose Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's preference, the justification provided (focusing on the size of the loss) does not match the decision reason's rule (comparing minimum probabilities). Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the basis for the individual's choice, but there's a slight possibility due to the alignment in the final decision."
9,"rscheinlichkeit immerhin unter 50%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (associated with the outcome of -6000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (associated with the outcome of 0 Euros). However, the decision reason as stated seems to be focused on the concept of minimum probability without specifying how it should be applied when one lottery has a higher probability of a negative outcome and the other a higher probability of a zero or positive outcome. In the context given, it seems the reason would consider the probability of the worst outcome (loss) for each lottery, thus comparing the 45% chance of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A to the 90% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B. But based on the description, the focus is on the ""minimum probability,"" which could be interpreted as looking for the lowest probability of any outcome, not necessarily the worst. For clarity, let's proceed with the understanding that the decision reason aims to minimize the probability of the worst outcome (loss), which may not perfectly align with the original description but fits a plausible interpretation related to risk aversion.

Relevant information for the decision reason includes:
- Lottery A: 45% chance of losing 6000 Euros
- Lottery B: 90% chance of losing 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, noting the higher potential loss in Lottery A but also its lower probability compared to the loss in Lottery B. They acknowledged the uncertainty and the trade-off between the magnitude of loss and its probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual decided on Lottery A after hesitation, citing the probability of loss being ""under 50%"" as a reason. This suggests they were influenced by the comparative probabilities of losing, focusing on the fact that Lottery A's loss probability is below 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probabilities and the trade-off between loss magnitude and probability, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the individual's focus was more on the absolute probability of loss being under 50% rather than directly comparing the minimum probabilities of loss between the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (if interpreting ""minimum probability"" as related to the worst outcome), but the individual's justification focuses on the absolute probability of loss being less than 50% for Lottery A, not directly on comparing minimum probabilities between the two options.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process and justification do not directly align with the decision reason as initially interpreted. The decision reason, as it seems to be about minimizing the probability of the worst outcome or considering the ""minimum probability"" in a more abstract sense, does not perfectly match the individual's focus on the probability being under 50% as a decisive factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as initially interpreted, was used by the individual. The individual's focus and justification do not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, suggesting other factors or a different interpretation of probability influenced their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (probability of losing 6000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (probability of losing 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the negative outcomes (0.1% for Lottery A and 0.2% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as ""definitiv beängstigender"" (definitely more frightening), indicating they considered the negative outcomes of both lotteries. However, the specific probabilities or the comparison of these probabilities are not directly mentioned. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the difference in probabilities is ""äußerst minimal"" (extremely minimal), implying they considered the probabilities but does not explicitly state how these probabilities influenced their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of negative outcomes) with that considered by the individual (negative outcomes and the minimal difference in probabilities). The individual seems to consider the negative aspects and the probabilities but does not explicitly discuss comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability of a negative outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the frightening aspect of the loss and the minimal difference in probabilities). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they do not explicitly prefer one lottery over the other based on the higher minimum probability of a negative outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of a negative outcome. While the individual considers the negative outcomes and mentions the minimal difference in probabilities, they do not explicitly apply the rule of preferring based on the minimum probability, leading to a low assessment score."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 50% (since there's a 50% chance of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's a 100% chance of getting 500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The information is:
- Lottery A: Minimum probability = 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome, which is the minimum value)
- Lottery B: Minimum probability = 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome, which is the guaranteed value)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the attractiveness of getting ""sicher Geld"" (secure money), which implies a consideration of the certainty or risk associated with the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to be motivated by the desire for a secure gain, indicating that the certainty of an outcome played a role in their deliberation. The mention of not being made more risk-tolerant by the additional credit suggests that the individual is risk-averse and values certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain, risk aversion). The individual's focus on the certainty of gain aligns with considering the minimum probability of each lottery, as a higher minimum probability (like 100% in Lottery B) directly translates to more certainty.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (valuing secure money, being risk-averse). The individual's justification for choosing based on the security of the outcome matches the decision reason's preference for the higher minimum probability, as Lottery B offers a 100% chance of gaining 500 Euros, which aligns with seeking secure money.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90
The individual's verbal report strongly suggests that they valued the certainty of the outcome, which directly relates to the minimum probability of each lottery. Their justification for choosing the secure option aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability. While the report does not explicitly mention probabilities, the focus on secure gain and risk aversion implies a consideration of the certainty provided by each lottery, making it very likely that the decision reason was used. However, the lack of explicit mention of probabilities or the decision reason's specific criteria prevents a 100% certainty assessment."
12,"gerade attraktiv

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (associated with the outcome -1000 Euros), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (associated with the outcome -500 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A because its minimum probability (100%) is higher than that of Lottery B (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be uncertain about the relevance of their current balance to their decision-making process. They mention the influence of additional balance and possibly taking the riskier option (Variante B) due to being more risk-seeking. They also consider having a 100% loss (Variante A) as not very attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to involve a consideration of risk (being ""risikofreudig"" - risk-loving) and the unattractiveness of a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the factors mentioned in the verbal report (uncertainty about current balance relevance, influence of additional balance, risk-seeking behavior, and the unattractiveness of a certain loss).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) does not seem to match the individual's justification, which involves risk preference and the dislike of certain losses rather than a direct comparison of minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the minimum probability of each lottery or preferred one lottery over the other based on this criterion. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be influenced by risk preference and the aversion to certain losses, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome) since the other outcome (0 Euros) has a higher probability (75%).
For Lottery B, the minimum probability among its outcomes is also 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes), as the 0 Euros outcome has a higher probability (50%).
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something (getting a positive outcome) and compared it between the two lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning something (i.e., getting at least 2000 Euros) was higher, even though the potential gains are lower than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning something). While the individual considered probabilities, the focus was on the probability of winning any amount, not specifically the minimum probability of each lottery's outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (chose Lottery B because the chance of winning anything was higher). The individual's reasoning aligns with preferring a lottery based on probability but does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of the ""minimum probability"" as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason and the individual's justification share a concern for probabilities but differ in their specifics.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities in making their decision, the specific focus and rule of the decision reason (minimum probability of each lottery's outcomes) do not directly align with the individual's stated justification (probability of winning anything). Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a vague connection through the consideration of probabilities."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum outcome value. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being more uncertain with losses and being deterred by the high value of 6000 Euros in Lottery A. They also acknowledge that losses are more probable in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be focusing on the potential losses and their probabilities, mentioning the high loss value in Lottery A and the higher probability of any loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum outcome of each lottery, which is -6000 Euros for Lottery A and -4000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual discusses the high loss value in Lottery A and the higher probability of losses in Lottery B, indicating they considered the outcomes but with a focus on the loss aspect and its probability rather than directly comparing the minimum outcomes as the decision reason would.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because its minimum outcome (-4000 Euros) is better than Lottery A's (-6000 Euros). The individual's justification, however, revolves around the difficulty of deciding with losses and the deterrence by the high loss value in Lottery A, along with the recognition of higher loss probability in Lottery B, not directly aligning with the decision reason’s straightforward comparison of minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates consideration of the loss aspects and their probabilities but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of comparing minimum outcomes to make the choice. The focus on the high loss value and the probability of losses suggests a different deliberation process than the one outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (or 1) for winning 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 99.9% for winning 0 Euros, but since the focus is on the minimum probability associated with any outcome, we consider the probability of the lowest outcome which is also the probability of not winning, which is 99.9%. However, the key comparison here is between the minimum probabilities of the guaranteed outcomes: 100% for Lottery A and 0.1% for the significant win in Lottery B, but since the 0.1% is the probability of the higher outcome, the minimum probability we're considering for the decision reason is actually the probability of the least favorable outcome which is 99.9% for Lottery B and 0% is not an outcome in A but the 100% is for the only outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of winning any amount in each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and effectively 0.1% for the significant win in Lottery B, but since the decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of any outcome, it's about comparing the certainty of an outcome. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of winning 5 Euros.
- Lottery B: 0.1% chance of winning 5000 Euros and 99.9% chance of winning 0 Euros.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied by comparing these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the potential loss (or rather, the lack of significant gain) from choosing Lottery B, acknowledging the low probability of the significant win in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the probability of the significant win in Lottery B was too small to be enticing, implying a consideration of the risk involved in choosing Lottery B over the guaranteed, though smaller, win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which translates to the certainty of getting at least some amount. The individual considered the low probability of the significant win in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the minimum probability of a desirable outcome but doesn't directly state a comparison of the minimum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason would.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The individual's justification implies a preference for the certainty of a smaller win (Lottery A) over the high-risk, high-reward option (Lottery B), which aligns with preferring a higher minimum probability (in this case, the certainty of winning something) but doesn't explicitly state this preference in terms of minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process and justification share some alignment with the decision reason's focus on probability and the preference for a more certain outcome, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing minimum probabilities as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus on the small probability of the significant win in Lottery B and the preference for the guaranteed smaller win in Lottery A suggests an intuitive application of a risk-averse strategy that aligns somewhat with the decision reason but does not perfectly match its criteria."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (since the other outcome has a 99.9% probability), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, which are 0.1% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual seems uncertain about their decision, mentioning the extremely low probability of loss in Lottery B but considering the loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A as negligible in comparison. The information considered by the individual includes the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B and the certain but small loss in Lottery A. The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the perceived insignificance of the certain loss in Lottery A compared to the potential, though highly unlikely, large loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B and the certain small loss in Lottery A). The individual's deliberation does involve probabilities but focuses more on the magnitude of potential losses rather than the minimum probabilities themselves. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability of a small loss. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries but rather weighs the significance of potential losses. Given this, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as it is defined, but there is a vague alignment in the outcome since the individual chose Lottery A, which also has the higher minimum probability according to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as defined, given the lack of explicit consideration of minimum probabilities in their justification. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, even if the reasoning process described does not directly apply the rule about minimum probabilities."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since both outcomes have a 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the risk of loss (""Verlust zu 50% bei anderer Lotterie zu risikoreich""), which implies they are aware of the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, especially focusing on the risk aspect of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for the smaller, certain gain over the risk of a significant loss (""Lieber den kleineren Gewinn auf der haben-Seite""), indicating a risk-averse approach, prioritizing certainty over potential higher gains that come with a risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and preference for certainty), it appears the individual is focusing on aspects related to the decision reason, though not explicitly mentioning minimum probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty and being averse to the risk of loss), there's a conceptual alignment. The individual's preference for Lottery B (with a 100% probability of a gain) over Lottery A (with a 50% probability of a significant loss) aligns with the decision reason's rule, as Lottery B has a higher minimum probability of a positive outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered aspects closely related to the decision reason (risk aversion, preference for certainty), and their justification aligns with the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability of a positive outcome. While the individual does not explicitly mention comparing minimum probabilities, their decision-making process and justification indicate a strong alignment with the decision reason, leading to a high assessment score. However, the lack of explicit mention of minimum probabilities prevents a perfect match, thus not reaching a 100% certainty level."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since both outcomes have 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: minimum probability of Lottery A = 50% and minimum probability of Lottery B = 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the appeal of a definitive win, especially after many loss-decisions in previous rounds, and expresses no desire to play with more risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the desire for a certain win and the avoidance of additional risk, given past experiences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the minimum probability of winning, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the certainty of the win and risk avoidance.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leans towards choosing a certain win, which aligns with the characteristics of Lottery B but does not explicitly mention the concept of minimum probability as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring Lottery B due to its certainty), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the minimum probability of each lottery as the reason for the choice. Therefore, it is somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has a 50% chance of either winning or losing). For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since it has a 100% chance of winning). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain from Lottery A compared to the potential loss from Lottery B, noting that the probability of winning in Lottery B is only 50%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found the guaranteed win of Lottery A more attractive due to the lower probability of winning in Lottery B and the potential for a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B. However, the individual's focus was more on the comparison of the attractiveness of the outcomes rather than explicitly stating the preference for the higher minimum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification implicitly aligns with this by preferring the guaranteed win (100% probability) of Lottery A over the gamble of Lottery B, but the individual's reasoning is more focused on the attractiveness of the outcomes given their probabilities rather than explicitly applying the rule of choosing based on the minimum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The assessment is not a perfect 100 because the individual's verbal report does not explicitly state that they chose Lottery A solely because it has a higher minimum probability of winning. However, the report does indicate that the individual was influenced by the probability of winning in Lottery B being only 50%, which suggests some consideration of the probability aspect that aligns with the decision reason. Thus, while there is a strong indication that the decision reason was considered, it is not the sole or explicitly stated reason for the choice, leading to a score of 70."

6000 zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen, da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner; einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since it has a 100% chance of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has a 50% chance of losing -6000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the minimum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the high stakes of Lottery B (6000 Euros) and seems hesitant to risk it, suggesting they are focusing on the potential loss. The individual's justification for their choice appears to be centered around avoiding the risk associated with the large sum of money in Lottery B, implying a preference for a safer option. The described deliberation process indicates a concern for minimizing potential downsides.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the risk associated with the large sum of money in Lottery B), it seems the individual is focusing on the potential downside of Lottery B, which indirectly relates to its lower minimum probability of a favorable outcome. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of winning 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing a safer option aligns with preferring a lottery based on its minimum probability, as Lottery A's certain outcome of 0 Euros can be seen as less risky compared to the gamble of Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their focus on avoiding risk and preferring a safer option aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher minimum probability. However, it is not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities, hence the assessment is not 100."
