STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the reference value is 2400 Euros. The reason calculates the mean difference between the outcomes of each lottery and this reference value, considering the probabilities of these differences. For Lottery A, the differences from the reference value are (2500-2400), (2400-2400), and (0-2400) Euros, with probabilities 33%, 66%, and 1%, respectively. For Lottery B, the difference is (2400-2400) Euros with 100% probability, which is 0. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the sure win in Lottery B and compares it to the probabilities and potential winnings in Lottery A, noting the possibility of winning the same amount or a little more in Lottery A but with varying probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides on the ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way), implying a preference for the sure outcome over the uncertain outcomes of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences from a reference value based on outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considers the sure outcome of Lottery B and the variable outcomes of Lottery A, focusing on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. The individual prefers the sure outcome, which aligns with preferring a certain, positive difference (in this case, zero difference from the reference, as it's a sure win) over potential positive or negative differences with associated probabilities.

The individual's focus on the sure win and the comparison of outcomes suggests an alignment with the decision reason's consideration of outcomes relative to a reference value. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or directly comparing these differences based on their probabilities, which is central to the decision reason. The individual's justification for choosing the sure way implies a risk-averse stance, which could be consistent with the decision reason if the mean difference calculation would favor the sure outcome. Given the information, it seems the individual is influenced by the certainty of the outcome but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific calculation and comparison process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision to choose the sure outcome could be aligned with the preference for a more favorable mean difference (as the sure outcome provides a consistent, predictable value), the explicit calculation and consideration of mean differences based on probabilities, as outlined in the decision reason, are not clearly described in the verbal report. Thus, there is uncertainty about whether the individual used the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision problem presents two lotteries, A and B, with different monetary outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which in this case is zero since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem. The reason calculates the mean difference between the outcomes and the reference value, considering their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability, and for Lottery B, the outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. Both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with probabilities of 66% and 67%, respectively. The mean difference for each lottery can be calculated as follows:
- For Lottery A: (2400 * 0.34) - (0 * 0.66) = 816
- For Lottery B: (2500 * 0.33) - (0 * 0.67) = 825
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the risk differences seem marginal to them. They also express a reluctance to choose either option A or B if given the choice.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not provide a clear justification for choosing one lottery over the other based on the provided information. Instead, they highlight their reluctance to engage with either option, suggesting a focus on the risk or uncertainty associated with both choices rather than a detailed calculation of expected outcomes or mean differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities. The individual, however, discusses the marginal nature of risk differences without explicitly mentioning calculations of mean differences or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, whereas the individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, focusing instead on the perceived marginal risk differences and a general reluctance to choose either option.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean differences between the lotteries' outcomes and a reference value. The individual's focus on risk differences and reluctance to choose either option does not align with the decision reason's emphasis on mean differences and their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes our reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The differences from the reference value (3000 Euros) for Lottery A are (4000-3000) = 1000 Euros with 80% probability and (0-3000) = -3000 Euros with 20% probability. For Lottery B, since it is the reference, its difference is 0 Euros with 100% probability. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering these probabilities. We calculate the mean difference for Lottery A as (1000*0.8 + -3000*0.2) = 800 - 600 = 200 Euros. Since Lottery B's mean difference is 0 (as it is the reference point), Lottery A has a more favorable mean difference according to this calculation.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the potential loss if the win does not occur but notes that 80% are ""recht gute Chancen"" (quite good chances), indicating they considered the probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the risk of not winning against the good chances of winning, implying a consideration of the trade-off between the potential outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the mean differences of outcomes from a reference value, which is implicitly Lottery B's sure outcome. The individual considers the risk and the good chances of winning in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention comparing mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case is Lottery A. The individual's justification focuses on the balance between risk and good chances, which could imply preferring Lottery A for its potential upside despite the risk, aligning with preferring a more favorable mean difference but without explicit calculation or reference to mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's considerations and justifications share some alignment with the decision reason (focusing on outcomes and their probabilities), there is no explicit mention of calculating mean differences or using a reference value as the decision reason dictates. The individual's process seems more intuitive and less formal than the decision reason's rule, suggesting some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there is no sure outcome in the decision problem, the reference value is zero. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability, and for Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (zero) are 4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The probabilities of these differences are 20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential gain (Gewinn) and the difference in probabilities (5%-Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied) between the two lotteries, noting that there is no negative risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the potential to gain 1000 Euros more (1k mehr) with a 20% probability, considering the 5% difference in probabilities as an acceptable risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean difference considering the probabilities, while the individual discusses the potential gain and the probability difference. The individual's consideration of the gain and the risk (probability difference) aligns partially with the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification implies a preference for the higher potential gain (Lottery A) despite the lower probability, which seems to align with considering the favorable difference but does not explicitly discuss mean differences or their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60

This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process involves considerations of gain and risk that partially align with the decision reason, there is no explicit mention of calculating or comparing mean differences based on probabilities. The individual's focus on the potential gain and the difference in probabilities suggests some alignment with the decision reason, but the lack of explicit discussion about mean differences or their probabilities introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with significant uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. Since neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome (both have probabilities less than 100% for their positive outcomes), the reference value is zero. The reason then calculates the differences between the outcomes and this reference value, which are simply the outcomes themselves since the reference value is zero. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A is (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery B is (3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean difference, making the decision reason indifferent between the two lotteries based on the calculated mean differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""Risikofaktor"" (risk factor) of 90-10, which directly refers to the probabilities associated with Lottery B (90% chance of winning 3000 Euros and 10% chance of winning 0 Euros). This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes for at least one of the lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides in favor of Lottery B based on the mentioned risk factor, implying that the high probability of winning (90%) was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences of the lotteries' outcomes from a reference value (which is zero in this case), considering their probabilities. The individual, however, seems to focus on the risk factor (probabilities) of Lottery B without explicitly mentioning calculations of mean differences or comparing the outcomes of both lotteries in a manner that aligns with the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same mean difference, but the individual chooses Lottery B based on its favorable risk factor (high probability of winning). This does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, which does not prefer one lottery over the other based on the calculated mean differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on the risk factor and the decision to choose Lottery B based on this factor does not reflect the consideration of mean differences from a reference value as outlined in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, as their verbal report does not indicate consideration of mean differences from a reference value or a comparative analysis of both lotteries based on the decision reason's criteria. The individual's decision seems to be influenced more directly by the perceived risk factor of Lottery B."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities to calculate mean differences from a reference value. In this case, since neither lottery offers a sure outcome, the reference value is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries:
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability.
Given this, we can calculate the mean difference for each lottery from the reference value (0 Euros) by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery B, the calculation is (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. For Lottery A, it is (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean difference from the reference value, indicating the decision reason can be applied but would lead to indifference between the two lotteries based on the calculated mean differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering not playing at all but decides based on ""geringeren Verluste,"" which translates to ""lower losses."" This implies the individual is focusing on the potential losses or downsides of each option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about minimizing losses, suggesting the individual prefers the option that results in less severe or fewer losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences of outcomes from a reference value, considering probabilities. In contrast, the individual seems to focus on minimizing losses, which does not directly align with calculating mean differences from a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual's justification is about minimizing losses, which doesn't directly correspond to the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on minimizing losses and the decision reason's calculation of mean differences from a reference value represent different approaches to decision-making.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -3000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A, considering the reference value of -3000 Euros, would be calculated as: ((-4000 - (-3000)) * 0.8 + (0 - (-3000)) * 0.2) = (-1000 * 0.8 + 3000 * 0.2) = (-800 + 600) = -200. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 since it is the reference point. Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a more favorable mean difference (0) compared to Lottery A (-200).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the total sum remaining after a potential loss and prefers controlling the outcome over risking a potentially higher loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the desire to control the outcome and avoid potentially higher losses, rather than explicitly discussing mean differences or the reference value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on mean differences from a reference value, but the individual discusses controlling outcomes and avoiding higher losses, not explicitly mentioning mean differences or a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, while the individual prefers the option that allows for control over the outcome and avoids higher potential losses. Although the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, the preference for avoiding higher potential losses indirectly suggests a consideration of the potential outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of mean differences from a reference value as the basis for the decision, which is central to the decision reason. However, the preference for controlling outcomes and avoiding higher losses suggests some alignment with considering potential outcomes, a key aspect of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some indirect alignment, it is not strong enough to conclude with certainty that the decision reason was used, leading to an assessment below the midpoint."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, there is no sure outcome with 100% probability in either lottery, so the reference value is zero. The outcomes of Lottery B are -4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. The outcomes of Lottery A are -3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (zero) are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B, and -3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A. These differences and their probabilities can be used to calculate the mean difference for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the probability of a loss (""eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit des Eintrittes"") and the amount of the loss (""geringere Summe""), indicating they are looking at both the probabilities and outcomes of the losses in the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states they accept a higher probability of loss in exchange for a smaller loss amount (""bei einem drohenden Verlust akzeptiere ich die höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit des Eintrittes vor der geringeren Summe""), suggesting their decision is based on balancing the probability and magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires consideration of the differences between outcomes and a reference value (in this case, zero), along with their probabilities. The individual considers the probabilities and amounts of losses, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification suggests they prefer the option that offers a smaller loss amount even if it means a slightly higher probability of that loss occurring, which could reflect a preference for a more favorable mean difference, given the context of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80

This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their consideration of loss probabilities and amounts, and their justification for choosing based on these factors, align with the principles of the decision reason. However, the assessment is not 100 because the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or directly comparing these across the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Nonetheless, the individual's approach seems to reflect a similar logic, focusing on the trade-off between the probability and magnitude of losses."

- Lottery A: -6000 Euros with 45% probability, 0 Euros with 55% probability.
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros with 90% probability, 0 Euros with 10% probability.
The mean difference for Lottery A is calculated as: (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros.
The mean difference for Lottery B is calculated as: (-3000 * 0.90) + (0 * 0.10) = -2700 Euros.
Thus, both lotteries have the same mean difference from the reference value (0 Euros), which is -2700 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual seems to focus on the high probability of avoiding a loss (or ""eine Zahlung ganz abzuwenden"") and mentions a personal reaction to the sums involved, indicating a consideration of the probabilities and the impact of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies the choice based on the high probability of avoiding a payment (or loss), suggesting that the probability of not losing is a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual seems to focus on avoiding a loss and the high probability of doing so, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual's justification emphasizes the high probability of avoiding a loss, which could be seen as related to preferring a more favorable outcome based on probability but does not directly mention comparing mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's focus on avoiding a loss and the high probability of doing so suggests some alignment with the decision reason's consideration of outcomes and probabilities. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences as the decision reason does, leading to uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating the mean difference between outcomes and a reference value. The reference value in this case is 0 since there are no sure outcomes. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries:
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability.
Given this, the decision reason can be applied by calculating the expected value (mean difference) for each lottery, which would be:
- For Lottery B: (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros.
- For Lottery A: (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros.
The decision reason would prefer the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would be indifferent between the two.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the difference in the risk percentage (""Risiko-Prozentsatz"") being comparably small, implying they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual states that the potentially required sum (""ggf. geforderte Summe"") is decisive, suggesting they focused on the magnitude of the potential losses or gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason requires consideration of the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate the mean difference, which seems to align partially with the individual’s focus on the risk percentages and the magnitude of the potential outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal expected values, but the individual's justification suggests a focus on the magnitude of potential outcomes, which could imply a consideration of the differences in outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is relatively low because, while the individual considered aspects related to the decision reason (such as risk percentages and outcome magnitudes), there is no clear indication that they applied the specific rule of calculating and comparing mean differences based on probabilities to make their decision. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating expected values or comparing them, which is central to the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A considering the reference value (500 Euros) would be calculated as (1000-500)*0.5 + (0-500)*0.5 = 250 - 250 = 0. For Lottery B, since it is the reference value itself, its mean difference is 0 (500-500 = 0). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing a ""sichere Summe"" (a sure sum) against the risk, indicating they are considering the certain outcome of one lottery against the uncertainty of the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual expresses hesitation (""Zögern"") about choosing between a sure amount and a risk, suggesting they are weighing the certainty of one option against the potential risks and rewards of the other.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing outcomes relative to a reference value, which aligns with the individual considering a sure sum against risk, implying they are thinking in terms of certain outcomes versus uncertain ones.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. While the individual's verbal report does not explicitly calculate or mention mean differences, their hesitation between a sure sum and a risk suggests an implicit consideration of the trade-offs involved in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of the sure outcome versus the risk, which aligns with the decision reason's use of a reference value and consideration of differences. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or applying the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, while there are indications that the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason, there is not enough explicit information to be certain that the decision reason was used as defined. Hence, the assessment is uncertain, falling at the midpoint of the scale."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated as: (0 - (-500)) * 0.5 + (-1000 - (-500)) * 0.5 = 250 * 0.5 - 500 * 0.5 = -125. For Lottery B, since it is the reference point, its mean difference is 0 (as there's no difference between the outcome and itself). Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the risk and finds an alternative with a guaranteed loss (""alternativloses Minusgeschäft"") unattractive. This suggests the individual is weighing the potential losses and risks associated with each lottery.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to take the risk, implying they find the potential for a better outcome (in this case, 0 Euros) more appealing than a guaranteed loss, even if that loss is smaller.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences from a reference value, considering the probabilities of outcomes. The individual seems to focus on the avoidance of a guaranteed loss and the attractiveness of taking a risk for a potential better outcome, which indirectly touches upon the idea of comparing outcomes but doesn't explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual's justification is based on the appeal of avoiding a guaranteed loss and the potential for a better outcome, which aligns with preferring a more favorable outcome but doesn't explicitly use the mean difference calculation as a basis for the decision.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's reasoning touches upon elements considered by the decision reason (such as preferring a potential for a better outcome over a guaranteed loss), it does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing mean differences from a reference value based on probabilities. Therefore, the individual's decision process seems to align partially with the decision reason but does not directly apply it as defined.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities to calculate the mean difference, using a reference value. The reference value in this case is zero since there's no sure outcome with 100% probability in either lottery. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros with probabilities 25%, 25%, and 50%, respectively. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros with probabilities 25% and 75%, respectively. The mean difference for each lottery can be calculated based on these outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be considering the probabilities of winning a certain amount of money, comparing a 50% chance of a smaller sum to a 25% chance of a higher sum. This implies the individual is looking at the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers a 50% chance of a smaller sum over a 25% chance of a higher sum. This suggests the individual values higher probabilities of winning over the potential for a higher payout, which could align with considering the expected value or a similar metric but does not directly mention the decision reason's specific criteria.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the outcomes, their probabilities, and calculating mean differences based on a reference value. The individual considers probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities, which involves a quantitative assessment. The individual's justification is more qualitative, preferring higher probabilities of winning smaller sums without explicit mention of calculating mean differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process and the decision reason share some similarities in considering probabilities and outcomes, but the individual does not explicitly follow the decision reason's quantitative approach of calculating mean differences based on a reference value. Therefore, while there's some alignment in the considerations, the exact method of the decision reason is not clearly followed.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20"
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The decision reason calculates the mean difference for each lottery by considering the differences between the outcomes and the reference value (0 Euros), weighted by their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""das umgekehrte Muster zur vorherigen Aufgabe"" which translates to ""the reverse pattern to the previous task,"" indicating they are comparing this decision to a previous one, possibly considering the risk and reward structure. They also mention ""die Risikowahrscheinlichkeit"" (the risk probability), suggesting they are aware of the probabilities involved. However, the specific outcomes and their probabilities are not directly mentioned.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states, ""hier arbeitet die Risikowahrscheinlichkeit mehr für uns, daher nehme ich das Risiko in Kauf, ggf. mehr Abgaben leisten zu müssen,"" which translates to ""here the risk probability works more in our favor, therefore I take the risk, possibly having to pay more taxes."" This suggests the individual believes the risk is worth taking because it somehow favors them, possibly implying a consideration of the potential losses and gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires an understanding of the outcomes, their probabilities, and the calculation of mean differences. While the individual discusses risk and the pattern of the task, there's no explicit mention of calculating mean differences or directly comparing the expected outcomes based on their probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the risk being favorable and the willingness to take it, which does not directly align with the calculation of mean differences as per the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences based on the outcomes and their probabilities, which is central to the decision reason. The report focuses more on the general perception of risk and its favorability rather than a detailed analysis of outcomes and probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly mention or imply the use of mean differences and their probabilities in making the decision. The individual's focus on risk and its perceived favorability does not align closely with the specific rule outlined in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason can be applied as it considers the outcomes and their probabilities of the lotteries. The reference value for this problem is 5 Euros, which is the sure outcome of Lottery A. The differences between the outcomes of Lottery B and the reference value are (5000 - 5) = 4995 Euros with 0.1% probability and (0 - 5) = -5 Euros with 99.9% probability. For Lottery A, the difference is (5 - 5) = 0 Euros with 100% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the risk associated with Lottery B as a crucial factor. 
Second, the justification for the choice seems to be based on the perceived risk of Lottery B being too deterrent, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean differences or the consideration of the reference value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes, probabilities, and the calculated differences from the reference value) with that considered by the individual (risk of Lottery B), it appears the individual focused on a different aspect (risk) rather than explicitly calculating mean differences or considering the reference value.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities) to the individual’s justification (risk being too high), there's no direct alignment since the individual's justification does not mention mean differences or probabilities in relation to a reference value.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The reference value, as per the decision reason, is -5 Euros since Lottery B offers a sure outcome. The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated as ((-5000 - (-5)) * 0.001 + (0 - (-5)) * 0.999) = (-5000 + 5) * 0.001 + 5 * 0.999 = -4995 * 0.001 + 4.995 = -4.995 + 4.995 = 0. For Lottery B, the mean difference is 0 since it's a sure outcome and thus its difference from the reference value is 0.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the sure loss in Lottery B versus the high probability of avoiding loss in Lottery A as crucial for their decision. The individual's justification focuses on the aspect of avoiding loss and the certainty of loss in one option compared to the other.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean differences considering probabilities) with that considered by the individual (certainty of loss vs. high probability of avoiding loss), there's a conceptual alignment in that both consider the probabilistic nature of the outcomes and their implications. However, the decision reason specifically calculates mean differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification emphasizes the avoidance of loss and the certainty of outcomes, which aligns with considering the differences from a reference point (in this case, avoiding loss or the sure loss in Lottery B). The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which, based on the calculations, would suggest indifference since the calculated mean difference for both lotteries, given the reference point, does not clearly favor one over the other in the context provided. However, the individual's focus on avoiding loss and the high probability of no loss in Lottery A suggests a consideration that aligns with preferring outcomes based on their probabilistic assessment, even if not explicitly calculating mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment reflects that while there are conceptual alignments between the decision reason and the individual's justification, such as considering probabilities and the avoidance of loss, the explicit calculation and comparison of mean differences as per the decision reason are not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the qualitative aspect of loss avoidance and certainty, rather than a quantitative comparison of expected outcomes. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there's a slight inclination to believe it was not directly applied as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, the reference value is the sure outcome of Lottery A, which is 1500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (0.5 * (3000 - 1500)) + (0.5 * (-3000 - 1500)) = 750 - 3750 = -3000. For Lottery A, since it is the reference point, its mean difference is 0 (as 1500 - 1500 = 0). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery A because 0 is more favorable than -3000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the lottery with a potential loss (Lottery B) is unappealing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A despite its smaller gain, implying the avoidance of potential loss was a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual seems to focus on the presence of a potential loss in one of the lotteries, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which leads to a preference for Lottery A. The individual also prefers Lottery A but justifies this choice by mentioning the avoidance of a potential loss, not explicitly the comparison of mean differences or the use of a reference value.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the justification provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's process of calculating mean differences and comparing them. However, the emphasis on avoiding loss can be seen as indirectly related to considering the negative difference from the reference point in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's final choice aligns with the decision reason, the explicit reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's criteria, indicating some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used. However, the avoidance of loss mentioned in the verbal report suggests some alignment with the concept of considering negative outcomes, thus the assessment is somewhat above the midpoint of uncertainty (50), but not high enough to suggest certainty that the decision reason was used as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the difference between its outcome and the reference value is 0 (since it is the reference), and for Lottery B, the differences are 3000 - 2000 = 1000 Euros and -3000 - 2000 = -5000 Euros. The probabilities of these differences are 50% each. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated as (1000 * 0.5) + (-5000 * 0.5) = -2000 Euros. Since Lottery A has a difference of 0, it has a more favorable mean difference compared to Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions achieving a secure gain with Lottery A and views Lottery B as offering a coin toss for an additional 1000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to ""play it safe"" and keeps the secure gain, implying a preference for the certain outcome over the gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the differences between lottery outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual seems to focus on the security of the gain and the gamble aspect of Lottery B, which indirectly touches upon the concept of comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case is Lottery A due to its certain outcome being preferable to the mean difference of Lottery B. The individual also chooses Lottery A, citing a desire to ""play it safe,"" which aligns with preferring a certain gain over a gamble but does not directly state a comparison of mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or considering the probabilities of the differences from a reference value as the basis for the decision. The individual's justification is more aligned with a general preference for certainty over a gamble, which is related but not a direct application of the decision reason as described. Therefore, it is somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome if one exists, or zero otherwise. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 1000 Euros, making it the reference value. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 since it's the reference point (1000 Euros - 1000 Euros = 0). For Lottery B, the differences from the reference value are 3000 - 1000 = 2000 Euros and -3000 - 1000 = -4000 Euros. The mean difference for Lottery B can be calculated by considering these differences with their probabilities: (0.5 * 2000) + (0.5 * -4000) = 1000 - 2000 = -1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery A since its mean difference is 0, better than -1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report translates to ""I'd rather play it safe than risk a higher win through a virtual coin toss."" This indicates the individual values certainty over the potential for a higher gain that comes with risk. The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of Lottery A. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the preference for avoiding risk rather than directly comparing expected outcomes or mean differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean differences from a reference value) with that considered by the individual (risk vs. certainty), it appears the individual did consider the aspect of risk, which is indirectly related to the concept of mean differences, as higher risk often corresponds to higher variability in outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically focuses on mean differences calculated from outcomes and their probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes a preference for playing it safe, which aligns with preferring a lottery with a more certain (and in this case, more favorable) outcome but does not directly state a comparison of mean differences. 

Given these observations, while the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A over Lottery B due to its certainty and thus implicitly its more favorable mean difference when considering risk), the verbal report does not explicitly discuss calculating or comparing mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the individual used the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers 0 Euros with 100% probability, which serves as the reference value since it is a sure outcome. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability. The differences between these outcomes and the reference value (0 Euros) are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, respectively. Given the probabilities, the mean difference for Lottery B is (6000*0.5 + -6000*0.5) = 0 Euros. Since Lottery A has a sure outcome of 0 Euros, its mean difference is also 0 Euros. Thus, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries because both have the same mean difference from the reference value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions being tempted by Lottery B's offer but expresses not being risk-tolerant enough for such offers. This indicates the individual considered the potential gains and losses of Lottery B and their personal risk tolerance.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on their risk tolerance rather than a detailed calculation of expected outcomes or mean differences from a reference point. They are deterred by the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences of outcomes from a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual, however, focuses on the risk associated with Lottery B and their personal risk tolerance, not explicitly mentioning calculations of mean differences or comparing outcomes to a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule would lead to indifference between the two lotteries based on mean differences, but the individual's justification is based on risk tolerance, not on calculating or comparing mean differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make their decision. The decision reason involves a specific calculation and comparison that is not mentioned in the verbal report.
