STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 2400 Euros.
- Lottery B: 33% chance of 2500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing (0 Euros) in Lottery B and the possibility of gaining an extra 100 Euros (implied by comparing the 2400 Euros of Lottery A with the potential 2500 Euros of Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of losing (0 Euros) is very low and the potential gain of extra money (100 Euros) is not very improbable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 100% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discusses the low probability of losing and the potential extra gain, not directly addressing the probability of the maximum outcome as the primary reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (100% chance of 2400 Euros). The individual's justification, however, seems to lean towards the potential benefits of Lottery B without directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of both lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. Instead, the individual's justification emphasizes the low risk of loss and the potential for extra gain in Lottery B, without directly comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes in both lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 34% for Lottery A and 33% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the difference in the sizes of the outcomes (100 Euros difference) and the difference in probabilities (1% difference) between the two lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risk-loving option), implying they chose based on a preference for taking risks, considering the small differences in both outcome size and probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (the differences in outcome sizes and probabilities). The individual did consider probabilities, but the focus was on the difference in probabilities rather than the absolute probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the more risk-loving option due to small differences in outcome and probability). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it emphasizes risk preference over the specific probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of probability differences and the choice based on risk preference do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. While there's a mention of probability, the context and application differ from the decision reason's criteria. Thus, it's unlikely that the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 80% chance of 4000 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of security and the risk associated with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially given the high sums involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on a desire for security and not wanting to gamble with the risk of not winning, especially with high sums at stake.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considered the security aspect and the risk of not winning, which indirectly relates to the probability of the maximum outcome but is more focused on the avoidance of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes security and avoiding risk, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome (100% probability of 3000 Euros in Lottery A) over a risky one (80% chance of 4000 Euros in Lottery B), but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus on security and risk avoidance suggests an alignment with the principle of preferring a higher probability of a significant outcome, but the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made by directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason prescribes. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the preference for security (which can be related to preferring higher probability outcomes), the report does not directly indicate the use of the specific decision reason regarding the comparison of probabilities of maximum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a higher probability of its maximum outcome, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B and notes that the difference in probabilities (implied to be between the two lotteries' chances of winning) does not seem significant. This suggests the individual is considering the potential outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly state comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes directly.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be drawn to Lottery B because of its potential for a higher gain, despite acknowledging a difference in probabilities that they do not consider large. The justification focuses on the attractiveness of the higher potential gain and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference, rather than explicitly on the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and probability differences), we see the individual does consider probabilities but not explicitly in the context of the maximum outcome probabilities.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (attracted to the higher potential gain and downplaying the probability difference), it appears the individual's decision process does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual is more focused on the size of the potential gain and the perceived significance of probability differences rather than the specific probability of achieving the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report suggests a focus on the size of potential gains and the perceived significance of probability differences, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes. This does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery based solely on the probability of its maximum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the 90% probability of winning in Lottery A as very enticing and notes the high reward of the other lottery (implied to be Lottery B) was not enticing enough due to its lower probability of winning (specifically mentioning it being under 50%). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery A was very appealing, and the lower probability (under 50%) of winning the higher amount in Lottery B was discouraging.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, we see the individual focused on the probabilities (90% for Lottery A and implicitly the lower probability for Lottery B), which aligns with the decision reason’s criteria.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (choosing Lottery A because of its higher winning probability), we observe a direct alignment. The individual’s decision to choose Lottery A based on its higher probability of the maximum outcome mirrors the decision reason’s preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability of winning is extremely low (""verschwindend gering""), which suggests they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual feels it's relatively indifferent because of the low probabilities but decides to go for the higher win (""höheren Gewinn setzen kann""). This implies the individual considered the amount of the potential win in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considered the low probabilities but also mentions the higher win, indicating they looked at both the probability and the amount of the win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing the higher win does not directly state they chose based on the probability of the maximum outcome but implies a consideration of the win amount, which aligns indirectly because the higher win (6000 Euros) has a lower probability (0.1%) than the lower win (3000 Euros with 0.2% probability), contrary to the decision reason’s preference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered the low probabilities of winning and opted for the higher win, which does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The report does not clearly indicate the individual prioritized the probability of the maximum outcome as the decision reason does. Thus, while there's a slight indication of considering relevant factors (probabilities and outcomes), the report does not strongly support the use of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the definitive loss of Lottery A versus the potential for no loss (0 Euros) in Lottery B, weighing the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B against the additional 1000 Euros loss in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the trade-off between the certainty of a loss in Lottery A and the risk of a larger loss in Lottery B, but also mentions the attractiveness of the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considers the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery B, which aligns with the concept of focusing on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros being the maximum outcome for Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification implicitly suggests a consideration of the attractiveness of the higher probability of avoiding loss (or achieving the maximum outcome of 0 Euros) in Lottery B, despite the overall negative expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness and consideration of the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's rule. However, the report also discusses the trade-off in terms of potential losses, suggesting that while the decision reason might have been a factor, it was not the sole or explicitly stated reason for the choice. Thus, while there's a strong indication that the decision reason was considered, it's not a perfect match, leading to a high but not certain assessment."
8,"erschreckend viel klingt)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, as it is the best possible outcome. For Lottery B, the probability of this outcome is 80%, and for Lottery A, it is 75%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities. Since 80% is greater than 75%, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential losses (5% difference) and the magnitude of the potential loss (4000 Euros being ""erschreckend viel"", or frighteningly much).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the smaller loss, implying they chose Lottery A because the potential loss of 3000 Euros was less daunting than the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros), which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the decision. The individual considered the potential losses and their probabilities implicitly but did not directly discuss the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the smaller potential loss, not the probability of avoiding loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the probability of the maximum outcome (in this case, avoiding any loss), while the individual's choice was based on minimizing potential loss, without consideration of the probabilities of the maximum (0 Euro) outcome. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the initial results, considered the uncertainty, noted that Lottery B has a lower maximum loss but a high probability of that loss, and compared the probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after hesitation because the probability (of the loss) is ""immerhin unter 50%"" (at least under 50%), indicating a focus on the probability of the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considered the probabilities and the magnitude of losses but specifically mentioned the probability being under 50% as a reason for choosing A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification seems to focus on the absolute level of probability (being under 50%) rather than comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries. The individual's choice of A, despite its lower probability of the maximum outcome (45% for -6000 Euros in A vs. 90% for -3000 Euros in B), suggests they did not apply the decision reason as stated.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 0.1% for Lottery A and 0.2% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A and finds it frightening, also noting that the difference in probabilities is minimal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the magnitude of the loss and the minimal difference in probabilities but does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's report emphasizes the magnitude of the loss and the minimal difference in probabilities without directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual seems concerned with the potential loss amount and the small probability difference, not directly applying the rule of comparing probabilities of maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The report focuses on the magnitude of the potential loss and the minimal difference in probabilities without explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason requires. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 1000 Euros with 50% probability
- Lottery B: 500 Euros with 100% probability
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the aspect of receiving ""sicher Geld"" (secure money), implying a preference for a certain outcome over a risky one. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by stating that the additional potential gain did not make them more willing to take risks, suggesting a focus on avoiding loss or ensuring a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considered the security of the money, which indirectly relates to the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B but does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the attractiveness of secure money, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome (Lottery B) over a risky one (Lottery A), but does not explicitly state a comparison based on the probability of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on ""sicher Geld"" (secure money) and the attractiveness of a certain gain aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, which is Lottery B in this case due to its 100% probability of the maximum outcome). However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for certainty, the explicit application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report."
12,"Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 100% chance of -500 Euros
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, and given that 0 Euros is the maximum outcome in both lotteries (with -500 Euros being less than 0 Euros), Lottery B has a 50% chance of achieving this maximum outcome, while Lottery A has a 0% chance of achieving 0 Euros (as it has a 100% chance of -500 Euros). This implies the decision reason would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on the given probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance to their decisions and the influence of additional funds, which might have led them to choose the riskier option, Lottery B. They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to be influenced by the potential for a better outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery B, even though it's risky, over the certainty of a loss in Lottery A. They express hesitation about their current financial situation's impact on their decision-making but lean towards the option that offers a chance, however small, of not losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual discusses the attractiveness of avoiding a certain loss and the influence of potential gains, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual's justification seems to lean towards choosing Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing money, which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher probability of its maximum outcome (0 Euros in this case).

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's verbal report does not directly state that they chose based on the probability of the maximum outcome, their reasoning about preferring a chance of no loss over a certain loss aligns with the principle of preferring a higher probability of a more favorable outcome. However, the report lacks explicit mention of comparing probabilities of maximum outcomes, which introduces some uncertainty.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which is 25% for both Lottery A and Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something and the height of the winnings in both lotteries. They mention that the probability of winning something at all (something positive) was higher in Lottery B, which led to their choice.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by stating that the probability of winning something was higher in B, even though the potential gains are lower compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, which is the same for both (25%). However, the individual's consideration was more about the overall probability of winning something positive, not specifically the maximum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. In this case, both lotteries have the same probability for their maximum outcomes, but the individual chose based on the overall probability of winning, not specifically the maximum outcome's probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. Instead, they considered the broader aspect of winning any positive amount, which aligns with but is not the same as the decision reason provided.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability (since it's the largest loss, but in the context of ""maximum outcome,"" we consider it as the most significant impact, whether positive or negative). For Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of loss is also -4000 Euros, which occurs with a 25% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 25% chance of -6000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 25% chance of -4000 Euros.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions being uncertain and notes the high value (in terms of loss) of 6000 Euros in Lottery A. They also acknowledge that losses make decisions harder for them and note that with Lottery B, it's more probable that there will be a loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to be deterred by the high loss potential in Lottery A (-6000 Euros) but recognizes the higher overall likelihood of any loss occurring in Lottery B. The justification isn't explicitly stated in terms of comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes but focuses on the perceived risks and the individual's aversion to losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's consideration seems more aligned with the aversion to losses and the perceived risk rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification doesn't explicitly mention comparing these probabilities. Instead, it revolves around the discomfort with high losses and the recognition of a higher probability of any loss in Lottery B.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the risk aversion and the discomfort with potential losses rather than the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but given the complexity of human decision-making and the indirect hints at considering probabilities, there's a degree of uncertainty.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 5 Euros at 100% probability
- Lottery B: 5000 Euros at 0.1% probability
Since we can derive the necessary information (maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the potential loss (or gain) of choosing Lottery B (the ""risikofreudigere Lotterie"" which translates to ""more risky lottery"") and noted the small probability of the significant gain in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified not choosing Lottery B because the probability of the significant gain was too small to be enticing, despite acknowledging the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the small probability of the significant gain in Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification for not choosing Lottery B (due to the low probability of the high gain) implies a preference for the lottery with a higher probability of its maximum outcome (in this case, Lottery A with 100% probability of its maximum outcome of 5 Euros), even though this is not explicitly stated.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's consideration of the probability of the significant gain in Lottery B and their justification for choosing the other option because of this low probability suggest alignment with the decision reason's rule. However, the individual does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of both lotteries as the decision reason requires. The verbal report indicates an intuitive application of the decision reason's principle but does not clearly articulate a comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's break down the analysis into the required steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome (in the context of being the ""best"" outcome, which in this case would be the least negative) is 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability, since the other outcome is more negative (-5000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of -5 Euros.
- Lottery B: 99.9% chance of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""enormously low probability of loss"" in Lottery B and compares it with the loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certain but minor loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the magnitude and certainty of the loss in Lottery A made the loss in Lottery B seem irrelevant in comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the low probability of loss in Lottery B and the certainty of a minor loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a preference based on the probability of the maximum outcome, implies a consideration of the probabilities and their implications, suggesting an alignment with the decision reason's rule in the context of evaluating the attractiveness of each lottery based on their respective ""best"" outcomes and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The verbal report suggests that the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B and the certainty of a minor loss in Lottery A. While the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference for the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, their deliberation process indicates an awareness and consideration of the factors that the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it seems likely that the decision reason played a role in the individual's decision-making process, but the report does not provide complete clarity on whether it was the decisive factor. Hence, the assessment is above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the risk associated with Lottery A, mentioning the 50% chance of loss, and compares it with the guaranteed gain of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the smaller, guaranteed gain over the risk of a higher gain coupled with a significant risk of loss, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considers the risk of loss and the guarantee of a smaller gain. The individual's consideration does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a 100% probability of its maximum outcome (1500 Euros), which aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome over a risky one. However, the individual's justification seems more focused on avoiding the risk of loss rather than directly comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning seems to be more aligned with risk aversion and the preference for a guaranteed gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as specified by the decision reason. While there is a slight alignment in the preference for Lottery B, the reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""Reiz des definitiven Gewinns"" (the appeal of a definitive win), suggesting they considered the certainty of the outcome. They also mention ""nach den vielen Verlust-Entscheidungen der letzten Durchgänge"" (after many loss-decisions in the last rounds), indicating a consideration of past experiences and possibly a desire to avoid further risk. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual expresses ""keine Lust, mit mehr Risiko zu spielen"" (no desire to play with more risk), which implies a preference for a safer option due to past losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty of the win (definitive Gewinn) in Lottery B. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which is Lottery B with 100% probability of its maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing a lottery seems to be based on avoiding more risk and the appeal of a definitive win, which aligns with preferring a lottery that offers its maximum outcome with certainty.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification for the choice (preference for a definitive win and avoiding more risk) aligns with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome). However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's decision seems also influenced by past experiences and a general risk aversion rather than solely the probability of the maximum outcome."
19,"so hoher Verlust bei B (zumal Wahrscheinlichkeit dort für Gewinn nur bei 50%)

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a 100% chance of its maximum outcome (1000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 50% chance of its maximum outcome (3000 Euros).
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the attractiveness of the gain from Lottery A compared to the potential loss from Lottery B, considering the probability of the gain at Lottery B is only 50%.
This indicates the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities of both lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies the decision by comparing the guaranteed gain of Lottery A to the risky, higher potential gain but also potential significant loss of Lottery B, emphasizing the 50% probability of the gain in Lottery B.
The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A versus the risk associated with Lottery B, especially highlighting the probability aspect.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is directly mentioned in the verbal report as the individual discusses the 50% probability of the gain in Lottery B and implicitly compares it to the certainty (100% probability) of the gain in Lottery A.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the attractiveness of the guaranteed gain in Lottery A over the risky gain in Lottery B, specifically mentioning the lower probability of the gain in B. This implies the individual preferred Lottery A because of its higher probability (certainty) of its maximum outcome, aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual considered the probability of the maximum outcomes and preferred the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, which aligns with the decision reason provided.

20,"zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen, da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner; einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 6000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk, implying they are considering the potential loss and the size of the potential gain. They also mention that taking a break (implied by ""einen Durchgang Pause"") seems acceptable, which can be interpreted as considering the option of not playing or choosing the safer option (Lottery A).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by expressing concern over the large sum at risk and implies a preference for avoiding this risk, suggesting a focus on the potential downside of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (size of potential gain and risk), it appears the individual is more focused on the risk aspect and the size of the potential gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk due to the large potential loss), the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual seems to prioritize risk avoidance over the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on risk avoidance and the size of the potential gain/loss, rather than the probability of achieving the maximum outcome, indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."
