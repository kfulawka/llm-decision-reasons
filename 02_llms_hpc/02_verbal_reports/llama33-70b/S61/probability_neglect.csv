Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 2500 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with a maximum outcome of 2500 Euros. The probabilities are considered, but the differences are deemed negligible. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery A is preferred due to its higher maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers the probability of losing (1% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A) as practically irrelevant and views the 33% chance of getting 2500 Euros as significant. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the nearly negligible risk of getting nothing was worth taking to potentially increase their gain. This suggests the individual is focusing on the potential for a higher gain (2500 Euros) and views the small risk as acceptable.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, considering probabilities as negligible) with that considered by the individual (focus on the higher potential gain and viewing the small risk as acceptable), there is alignment. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible) matches the individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the potential for a higher gain despite a small risk. This indicates the individual likely used a reasoning process similar to the decision reason to make their decision.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 2400 Euros with a 34% probability, and Lottery B offers 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. The difference in probabilities (1 percentage point) can be considered negligible. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (2500 Euros for Lottery B and 2400 Euros for Lottery A) and the assessment that the probability differences are negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the low chances of winning in both lotteries but deemed them not completely unrealistic. They also noted that the numerical values of the outcomes were nearly identical, which led them to focus on whether the loss of 100 Euros in the maximum outcome would be worth the increase in the winning chance by one percentage point. Second, the individual's justification for their choice was based on mitigating the risk of losing, considering the high risk of getting nothing, and deciding that this mitigation was more valuable than having 100 Euros more in the winning case.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and negligible probability differences) with that considered by the individual (focus on the trade-off between the increase in winning chance and the decrease in maximum outcome), there is a partial overlap. The individual did consider the outcomes and the probabilities but framed their decision in terms of risk mitigation rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes given negligible probability differences. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible) to the individual's justification (prioritizing risk mitigation over a higher maximum outcome), there is a divergence. The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they prioritized the increase in probability over the maximum outcome, contrary to what the decision reason would suggest if it were the sole basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason (such as the outcomes and probabilities), their justification and final decision-making process did not align closely with the decision reason's rule, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (4000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (3000 Euros). The probabilities are not identical, but the reason's applicability depends on whether their differences are considered negligible. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the assessment of the probability differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and compared it with the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), implying they chose Lottery A because the risk associated with Lottery B, although small, was not negligible enough to justify the potential higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences. The individual, however, focused on the risk of losing and the certainty of gain, which indirectly touches upon the outcomes but emphasizes risk rather than the maximum potential gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, chose based on risk aversion, preferring the certain outcome over the potential for a higher but riskier gain. This suggests the individual did not apply the rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the maximum outcome when probability differences are deemed negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on risk and the certainty of the outcome rather than the comparison of maximum outcomes under the condition of negligible probability differences indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 25% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (4000 Euros for B and 3000 Euros for A) and the assessment of whether the probability differences (20% vs. 25%) are negligible. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a comparison to another lottery scenario (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and emphasizes the importance of significantly increasing success chances over maximizing potential gain in low-probability, realistic lotteries. This suggests the individual considers both the outcomes and the probabilities, as well as the concept of significant increases in success chances.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual values increasing success chances more than maximizing the potential gain, especially in scenarios where the lottery is ""unwahrscheinlichen, aber realistisch möglichen"" (unlikely but realistically possible). This indicates the individual prioritizes the probability of winning over the maximum potential gain in such scenarios.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and the negligibility of probability differences. The individual, however, seems to prioritize increasing the chances of success, which aligns with considering probabilities but does not directly address the comparison of maximum outcomes when probability differences are deemed negligible.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible. The individual, however, prioritizes increasing success chances over maximizing potential gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the higher maximum outcome when probabilities are similar.

Based on these comparisons, the individual’s focus on increasing success chances and the emphasis on the comparison to another scenario suggest a different decision-making process than the one outlined by the decision reason. The individual does not explicitly mention preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome when the probability differences are negligible, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of both lotteries (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) and the assessment of whether the differences in probabilities (45% vs. 90%) are considered negligible. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery B (90% is described as ""beinahe garantiert"" or nearly guaranteed) and the amount of the potential win (3000 Euros is considered a ""ziemlich hoher Gewinnwert"" or a pretty high win value). They also considered the lower probability of winning in Lottery A (45% chance).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the 90% chance seemed nearly guaranteed, and they preferred the safer option for a win over risking everything on a 45% chance, even though the potential win was higher in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the high probability of winning in Lottery B and the preference for a ""sichere Route"" (safe route), indicating that the probability difference was not considered negligible but rather a key factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are similarly high or the differences are negligible. In contrast, the individual's choice was based on the perceived guarantee of the 90% probability and the desire for a safer option, not solely on the maximum possible outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The key factor in the individual's choice was the high probability of winning in Lottery B and the desire for a safe win, rather than comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries when ignoring significant differences in probabilities. This indicates that the decision reason, which prioritizes the maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, was not used by the individual."
6,"s bei einem Glücksfall getroffen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the probabilities and the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the probabilities of winning in each lottery (0.1% for Lottery A and 0.2% for Lottery B) and the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B). The difference in probabilities (0.1%) can be considered negligible given the context of very low probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason would likely focus on the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries, deeming them ""praktisch vernachlässigbar"" (practically negligible). The individual justifies their choice by stating that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also overcome a 0.1% chance, implying that the difference in probabilities is not significant to their decision. They then mention making their decision based on the height of the prize money in case of a win (""basierend auf der Höhe des Preisgelds bei einem Glücksfall"").

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, it's clear that the individual also considered the probabilities negligible and focused on the maximum outcomes. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification for their choice aligns with this rule, as they decided based on the prize money, implying a preference for the lottery with the higher maximum outcome (Lottery A, with 6000 Euros). This suggests that the individual used a similar logic to the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 20% probability), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (with 100% probability). Since Lottery A has a more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros vs -3000 Euros), the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information is the maximum outcomes of both lotteries and the probabilities associated with these outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of no loss (20% for Lottery A) and the difference in potential loss between the two lotteries (an additional 1000 Euros loss for Lottery A if the 80% probability occurs, compared to the certain loss of Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aimed to minimize the realistically probable loss, considering the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A as too low to justify the potential for an additional 1000 Euros loss compared to the certain loss of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and considers probability differences negligible. The individual, however, focused on minimizing the probable loss and considered the probabilities (especially the 20% chance of no loss) significant in their decision-making.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros) if probability differences are considered negligible. However, the individual chose Lottery B because they prioritized minimizing the probable loss, indicating that they did not consider the probability differences negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's focus on minimizing probable loss and their consideration of the specific probabilities (especially the 20% chance of no loss) suggest that they did not use the decision reason to make their choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a 20% probability of losing 4000 Euros, and Lottery B has a 25% probability of losing 3000 Euros. The maximum outcomes are both losses, but with different amounts. The probabilities are not identical but could be considered relatively close, given the context of the decision reason. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the comparison of the probabilities (20% vs 25%) and the comparison of the maximum loss outcomes (-4000 Euros vs -3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the losses and the amounts of the potential losses. They mention that the probabilities were low, but they were not willing to risk a larger loss to reduce the chance of a loss by a small margin (implied by ""5 Prozentpunkte"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on their preference for avoiding larger losses over reducing the probability of a loss by a small amount. They also mention that loss amounts are valued higher than gain amounts, which implies a risk-averse or loss-averse attitude, particularly towards larger losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the amounts of the losses, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically looks for the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible, which in this context would mean preferring the smaller loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probabilities are considered negligible. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the aversion to larger losses and the valuation of loss reduction, which doesn't directly align with simply choosing the lottery with the more favorable (smaller) maximum loss outcome without considering the probabilities as negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding larger losses and their specific justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible. The individual's decision-making process seems to involve a more nuanced consideration of risk aversion and loss aversion rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers a maximum loss of -3000 Euros with a 90% probability, and Lottery B offers a maximum loss of -6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A and -6000 Euros for B) and the probabilities (90% for A and 45% for B). Given that the decision reason considers the differences in probabilities negligible, it would prefer Lottery B because it has a more favorable maximum outcome in terms of magnitude (less negative, or in this context, less severe loss), despite the higher loss value, the reasoning seems to misunderstand the application of ""more favorable"" in the context of losses. However, the key aspect here is whether the individual considers the probability differences negligible and focuses on the maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the high loss amounts in both options and the attractive aspect of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%. This indicates the individual is considering both the outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on avoiding the potential for a higher loss of 6000 Euros, indicating a risk-averse approach rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes based on their probabilities being negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes and considering probability differences as negligible) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, but with a focus on risk aversion), there seems to be a partial alignment but the individual's focus is more on risk aversion rather than strictly on the maximum outcomes with negligible probability differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible) to the individual's justification (avoiding the higher potential loss, indicating a preference for the less risky option), it appears the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision is more aligned with risk aversion than with comparing maximum outcomes under the assumption of negligible probability differences.

STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. Given Lottery A offers a maximum outcome of -6000 Euros and Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of -3000 Euros, both with very low probabilities (0.1% and 0.2%, respectively), the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information is the maximum outcomes (-6000 Euros for A, -3000 Euros for B) and the assessment that the probability differences (0.1% vs. 0.2%) are negligible.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities (0.1% and 0.2%) as approximately equal or irrelevant for a single trial, indicating they view the probability difference as negligible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's goal was to minimize the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in a theoretical unfortunate case, implying they focused on minimizing the loss in case of an unfavorable outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the maximum outcomes and deeming the probability differences negligible. The individual also treats the probabilities as negligible and focuses on the outcome in case of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probabilities are deemed negligible. The individual aims to minimize the loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery with the less negative (more favorable) maximum outcome, given the context of minimizing loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's focus on minimizing the loss ( Strafbetrag ) in case of an unfavorable outcome and treating the probabilities as negligible aligns closely with the decision reason's rule to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are considered negligible. Given this alignment, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A offers 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability, while Lottery B offers 500 Euros with 100% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery A is 1000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 500 Euros. The decision reason can be applied because the information relevant to it (maximum outcomes and the consideration of probability differences) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical value of both options, implying they looked at the expected outcomes, and also considered the aspect of ensuring a gain versus maximizing potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by prioritizing the certainty of increasing their gain over the potential for a higher gain, indicating a preference for a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are deemed negligible. The individual, however, seems to prioritize the certainty of a gain, which suggests they did not ignore the probability differences as the decision reason would.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the value of a guaranteed gain, which does not align with ignoring probability differences or solely focusing on the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

This assessment is based on the conclusion that the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's criteria. The individual prioritized the certainty of a gain over the potential for a higher maximum outcome, indicating that they did not apply the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when considering negligible probability differences."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities of each lottery and their maximum outcomes. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros. The probabilities of the lotteries are 50% for the positive outcome in Lottery A and 100% for the negative outcome in Lottery B. However, according to the decision reason, the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the 50% probability as a ""relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis"" (relevant chance of an outcome), which indicates they are taking into account the probability of the outcome in Lottery A. The individual's justification for their choice is to ""den absoluten möglichen Verlustwert zu minimieren"" (minimize the absolute possible loss value), which implies they are focusing on the worst-case scenario or the maximum potential loss of each lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability and minimizing the absolute possible loss), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual is indeed considering the aspect of minimizing loss, which indirectly relates to the maximum outcomes. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, ignoring the probability differences. The individual's focus on minimizing the absolute loss suggests they are prioritizing the avoidance of the worst outcome, which in this case aligns with choosing the lottery that does not have the most unfavorable maximum outcome (since both outcomes are negative, minimizing loss means choosing the lesser negative outcome). The verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes based on their favorability but rather on minimizing loss, which can be seen as a related but distinct approach.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process involves considering the potential outcomes and trying to minimize loss, it does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome based on negligible probability differences. The focus on minimizing loss leads to a choice that happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest in this particular scenario, but the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, both lotteries have outcomes with 25% and other probabilities, making the differences in probabilities of the specific outcomes (25% for the highest outcomes in both) not directly comparable due to the structure of Lottery B having two non-zero outcomes. However, the maximum outcomes are 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of each lottery (6000 Euros for A, 4000 Euros for B) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes (25% for both the highest outcomes but considering the structure, it simplifies to comparing the maximum outcomes directly as the reason suggests ignoring negligible probability differences).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all non-zero amounts as large and focused on which option gave the higher probability of winning a large amount. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual based their decision on the option that provided a higher probability of winning a large amount, not directly on the maximum outcome but on the likelihood of winning any significant amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, whereas the individual focused on the probability of winning any large amount, not specifically the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible, but the individual's justification was based on the probability of winning a large amount, which aligns more with comparing overall expected values or likelihoods of significant wins rather than solely the maximum possible outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus was more on the probability of winning a significant amount rather than specifically on the maximum outcome as the primary criterion, which diverges from the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, given that the differences between the probabilities are considered negligible. In this case, the lotteries have different outcomes and probabilities, so the reason can be applied. The relevant information is:
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability
- Lottery A: -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 50% probability
The maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, but since the reason focuses on the more favorable maximum outcome in case of a loss, we consider the less negative outcome, which is -2000 Euros for Lottery A and -6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the magnitude of these losses. They also considered the probability of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual prioritized minimizing the chance of losing anything, considering a 25 percentage point higher chance of not losing as more important than reducing the loss amount in the unlikely event of a bad outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probabilities and the more favorable maximum outcome, considering negligible differences in probabilities. The individual, however, focused on minimizing the chance of any loss and the magnitude of losses, not explicitly on comparing the maximum outcomes in terms of being more favorable in a direct comparison of loss amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the reduction of loss probability rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes or focusing on the less negative loss as the more favorable outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual prioritized minimizing the chance of any loss and considered the magnitude of potential losses, rather than focusing on the more favorable maximum outcome as defined by the decision reason. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. 
In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability, while Lottery B offers 5 Euros with a 100% probability. 
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (5000 Euros for Lottery A and 5 Euros for Lottery B) and the probabilities associated with these outcomes. 
Given that the probability of winning in Lottery A is very low (0.1%), it might be considered negligible, especially when compared to the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions that ""0,1% sind und bleiben realistisch irrelevant,"" which translates to ""0.1% is and remains realistically irrelevant."" This suggests the individual considers the low probability of winning in Lottery A as negligible in practical terms. 
The individual also compares having a guaranteed small win to the illusion of a jackpot, indicating they weighed the certainty of Lottery B against the high-risk, high-reward nature of Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot. This implies they valued the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B over the potential but highly unlikely large payout in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considered the practical irrelevance of the 0.1% probability and the value of a guaranteed win, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes in the context of negligible probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are negligible. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for a guaranteed small win over a highly uncertain large win, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes based on their magnitude alone. 
The individual's focus is more on the certainty aspect rather than purely on the maximum potential outcome, which slightly diverges from the decision reason's rule that prioritizes the maximum outcome when probabilities are not decisive.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the practical irrelevance of the low probability and valued certainty, their justification prioritizes the guaranteed win aspect over directly comparing maximum outcomes based on magnitude, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Thus, there's a partial alignment but not a complete match with the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome when the differences in probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with a high probability of 99.9%), and for Lottery B, the outcome is a loss of -5 Euros (with 100% probability). The information relevant to this reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries and the assessment of their probabilities. Given that one lottery offers a guaranteed loss and the other a near guarantee of no loss, the reason can indeed be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A as extremely unattractive at first, which drew them to Lottery B. However, upon further consideration of the probability distribution in Lottery A, they found the 0.1% chance of a significant loss to be negligible, making the outcome of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by considering the risk of the significant loss in Lottery A as negligible due to its low probability, thus making the effective outcome of Lottery A more favorable (0 Euros) compared to the guaranteed loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the outcomes, focusing on the negligibility of the risk in Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's consideration of probabilities and preference for the more favorable maximum outcome when probability differences are negligible.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it effectively offers a better outcome (0 Euros) due to the negligible risk of the significant loss, matches the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome when the probability differences are considered negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's deliberation process, as described, closely aligns with the decision reason provided, considering the negligibility of the risk in Lottery A and preferring it for its more favorable maximum outcome. This suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros, while Lottery B offers a guaranteed 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros for A and 1500 Euros for B) and their associated probabilities. Since the decision reason considers negligible probability differences, it's applicable when comparing the maximum outcomes directly.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical expectation (Mittelwert) of each lottery, noting that Lottery A's expected value is 0 Euros due to equal probabilities of gaining or losing 3000 Euros, while Lottery B guarantees a gain of 1500 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed median gain of 1500 Euros, unlike Lottery A, which has an expected value of 0 Euros over numerous attempts. The guarantee of 100% chance for Lottery B made the decision straightforward for the individual.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible, but the individual's consideration is more about the expected value and the guarantee of the outcome rather than directly comparing maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probabilities are considered negligible, but the individual's justification is based on the guaranteed outcome and the expected value, not directly on comparing the maximum possible outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the expected value and the guarantee of the outcome rather than comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the differences between the probabilities are negligible. For Lottery A, there's a 100% chance of winning 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, there's a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (3000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (2000 Euros). The decision reason can be applied by comparing the maximum outcomes since it suggests ignoring negligible probability differences, which in this context, might imply considering the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A as a basis for comparison.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a previous similar decision and notes that the secure option (Lottery A, in this case, offering 2000 Euros with 100% probability) is now even more attractive. They seem to consider the nature of the lotteries (one being risky and the other secure) and possibly the attractiveness of the guaranteed outcome.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the attractiveness of the secure option, implying that the guaranteed nature of Lottery A's outcome was a significant factor. The decision is described as ""selfverständlich,"" which translates to ""obvious"" or ""a matter of course,"" suggesting that the choice was clear to them, likely due to the secure nature of Lottery A's outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes when probability differences are negligible. The individual considers the attractiveness of the secure option, which aligns with evaluating outcomes but doesn't directly mention comparing maximum outcomes based on negligible probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome under certain conditions. The individual's justification emphasizes the attractiveness of the secure option, not directly addressing the maximum potential outcome of both lotteries in a comparative manner that aligns with the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not closely align with the decision reason as defined, particularly in how they justify their choice and the factors they consider. The individual focuses on the security of the option rather than comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries based on the decision reason's criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification and consideration do not closely align with the specifics of the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 1000 Euros. The probabilities of the maximum outcomes are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. However, the decision reason considers probability differences negligible. The information relevant to this reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries (3000 Euros for A and 1000 Euros for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery B, comparing it to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A, which implies they are considering the outcomes and possibly the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual justifies their choice by noting that while the guaranteed win in Lottery B is significantly less than the maximum outcome of Lottery A, it is still more than the expected value of Lottery A. This implies the individual is weighing the certainty of a gain against the potential for a higher or lower outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and expected values), we see there's a partial alignment since the individual discusses outcomes but focuses more on the guaranteed nature of one outcome versus the potential outcomes of the other.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible) with the individual's justification (focusing on the guarantee and comparing it to the expected value), there seems to be a deviation. The individual does not explicitly state that they are choosing based on the maximum possible outcome when ignoring probability differences; instead, they emphasize the value of a guaranteed win over potential gains or losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries), their justification and focus (on the guarantee and expected value comparison rather than directly on maximum outcomes when neglecting probability differences) suggest that the decision reason as described was likely not the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probabilities of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if the probability differences are negligible. In this case, Lottery A has a fixed outcome of 0 Euros, while Lottery B has a 50% chance of 6000 Euros and a 50% chance of -6000 Euros. The maximum outcome of Lottery B (6000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (0 Euros). However, the decision reason also mentions that the differences between the probabilities of the lotteries are considered negligible. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of 0 Euros and Lottery B has a 50% chance of each outcome, the probability differences are not negligible. Nevertheless, we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason: the maximum outcomes of the lotteries and their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that one of the options (Lottery A) was not a lottery and had a fixed outcome, and the potential risk of the other option (Lottery B), specifically the possibility of losing 6000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual excluded Lottery B as soon as they saw the potential loss of 6000 Euros and stated that the probabilities were irrelevant at that point.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes and probabilities, while the individual focused on the risk of loss and the fact that one option was not a lottery. The individual did consider the potential outcomes, but the focus was on the downside risk rather than the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome if probability differences are negligible, but the individual excluded Lottery B due to the potential loss, without considering the maximum outcome as the primary factor. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual did not prioritize the maximum outcome.
