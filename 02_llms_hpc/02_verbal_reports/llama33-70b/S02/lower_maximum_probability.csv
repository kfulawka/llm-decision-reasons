STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for the 2400 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2400 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery: 66% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the possibility of no losses in Lottery B and the low probability of the 0 Euros outcome. They also considered the potential gain of 100 Euros (implied by the difference between the 2500 Euros and 2400 Euros outcomes) in Lottery B and seemed to weigh this against the certainty of 2400 Euros in Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be based on the perceived low risk of the 0 Euros outcome and the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (low probability of 0 Euros, potential gain of 100 Euros), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason would require. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the potential outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on the potential for higher gain and low risk of loss).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, both lotteries have their maximum probabilities associated with the 0 Euro outcome (67% for Lottery B and 66% for Lottery A), since these are the highest probabilities for each lottery. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery B: 67% (maximum probability for 0 Euros)
- Lottery A: 66% (maximum probability for 0 Euros)
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the difference in the amounts of the two lotteries (100 Euros difference) and the difference in their probabilities (1% difference).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose the ""risikofreudigere Variante"" (more risk-friendly variant) because the difference in probability was not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of the 0 Euro outcome for both lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the difference in the amounts and the difference in probabilities, not specifically focusing on the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A (66% vs. 67%). The individual, however, chose based on the risk-friendliness and the small difference in probabilities, not explicitly mentioning the maximum probability or following the rule of preferring the lower maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification and the information they considered do not align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. The verbal report indicates a focus on risk tolerance and the small differences in outcomes and probabilities, rather than the specific rule of choosing based on the lower maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (for winning 4000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is the maximum probability of each lottery: 100% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a ""Sicherheitsbedürfnis"" (need for security) and not wanting to gamble with the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B, especially considering the high sums involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by preferring security and not wanting to risk the 20% chance of not winning, implying a preference for a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of winning for each lottery, while the individual focuses on the security aspect and the risk of not winning (20% in Lottery B). The individual's consideration indirectly touches upon the probabilities but does so from a risk aversion perspective rather than directly comparing maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (80% vs. 100%). However, the individual's justification suggests a preference for security, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its 100% guarantee, not because of comparing maximum probabilities directly.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. Instead, the individual's choice seems to be driven by a desire for security and risk aversion, which indirectly relates to but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 80% (for winning 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a lower maximum probability, according to the decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions the potential for a higher gain in Lottery B and notes that the probability difference of 5% does not seem significant. This suggests the individual considered the potential gains and the probability differences between the two lotteries.
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to be drawn to Lottery B because of its potentially higher gain, despite acknowledging a small probability difference. The justification focuses on the attractiveness of the higher potential gain and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and probability differences), we see a mismatch. The individual did not explicitly mention considering the maximum probabilities of winning nothing (0 Euros) as the basis for their decision.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (attracted to the higher potential gain and considering the probability difference as not significant), it appears the individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason. The individual's focus was on the potential gain and the difference in probabilities of winning, not on the maximum probabilities of the outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the maximum probability of each lottery or preferred the lottery based on having a lower maximum probability. Instead, the decision was influenced by the potential for higher gain and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference, which does not align with the given decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros, since it's the higher probability between the two outcomes). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery: 90% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual was attracted to the 90% probability in Lottery A and found the less than 50% probability in Lottery B unappealing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the 90% probability was very enticing, and the higher potential gain of Lottery B was not enough to overcome this. Additionally, the individual was deterred by Lottery B's probability being under 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities but was attracted to the higher probability (90%) and deterred by the lower probability (under 50%), which suggests they were looking at the probabilities but not necessarily comparing them in the way the decision reason dictates (preferring the lower maximum probability).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (55% vs. 90%). However, the individual's justification indicates they were swayed by the higher probability of winning in Lottery A, not by comparing the maximum probabilities in the manner the decision reason suggests.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A and their justification for choosing it based on this high probability, rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries and preferring the lower one, suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"ist und ich dann ja auch auf den höheren Gewinn setzen kann

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros) and for Lottery B, it is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). 
The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions that the probability of winning is very low (""verschwindend gering""), implying they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual states that because the probability of winning is very low, it feels relatively equal, and they decided to go for the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn setzen""). 
This implies the individual focused on the potential gains when the probabilities of winning were perceived as similarly low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason requires comparing the maximum probabilities, but the individual discusses the low probability of winning without explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on the perceived equal low probability of winning and the desire for a higher gain, not on comparing the maximum probabilities. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as their focus was on the low probability of winning and the potential gain rather than the comparison of maximum probabilities.

7,"lust bei Lotterie B nicht die 1000€ mehr verlust in dieser Lotterie wert

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, the maximum probability for Lottery A is 100% (for a loss of 3000 Euros) and for Lottery B is 80% (for a loss of 4000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the trade-off between the potential losses and the probabilities of those losses in the two lotteries. Specifically, they mentioned the 20% probability of a larger loss in Lottery B and compared it to the certain loss in Lottery A, weighing whether the difference in potential loss (1000 Euros more in Lottery B) was worth the lower probability of that loss. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the balance between the size of the potential loss and its probability, indicating a deliberation process that involves comparing the risks and potential outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential losses), it appears that the individual did consider probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the decision reason specifically looks at the maximum probability to make a decision, whereas the individual's justification discusses the trade-off between the probability and the amount of loss. The individual's reasoning does not explicitly mention preferring the lottery based solely on the lower maximum probability but rather weighs the probability against the potential loss. Thus, while there is some alignment in considering probabilities, the individual's justification does not perfectly match the rule of the decision reason, which prefers based on the maximum probability alone.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery B has a maximum probability of 80% (for 0 Euros) and Lottery A also has a maximum probability of 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 80%
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 75%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the difference in probabilities (""5% Unterschied"") and the impact of the potential loss (""4000€ doch erschreckend viel klingt""), indicating they considered the magnitudes of the losses and the probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided ""für die kleinere Verlustsumme"" (for the smaller loss sum), suggesting their decision was based on minimizing the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the difference in probabilities and the magnitude of losses. The individual's considerations do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability (Lottery A, with 75%), and the individual chose Lottery A but justified it based on the smaller loss sum, not the maximum probability. 

The individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) but the justification provided does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule (focusing on maximum probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice coincides with what the decision reason would suggest, their verbalized reasoning process does not align with the decision reason's criteria, indicating it is unlikely that the decision reason was used. However, the coincidence in the choice and the fact that some consideration of probabilities was mentioned prevents a complete dismissal of the possibility."
9,"rscheinlichkeit immerhin unter 50%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for losing 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 55% for A and 90% for B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the initial results, considered the uncertainty, noted that Lottery B has a lower loss but a high probability of that loss, and compared the probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A after some hesitation because its probability of loss (implied by ""Wahrscheinlichkeit immerhin unter 50%"") is below 50%, which suggests a focus on the probability aspect.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities but specifically mentioned being influenced by the fact that one probability is below 50%, which aligns with considering the lower maximum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability. The individual chose Lottery A because its relevant probability is ""unter 50%"", which indicates a preference for the lower probability, aligning with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report indicates an alignment with the decision reason's focus on probability and the preference for the lottery with the more favorable (lower) probability condition, even though the specific term ""maximum probability"" is not used. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the probability being below 50%, which directly relates to the decision reason's criterion of preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. In this case, both lotteries have their maximum probability associated with the outcome of 0 Euros, which is 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities. Since 99.8% is less than 99.9%, according to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possible loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A as frightening and mentions that the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries is minimal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential loss and the minimal difference in probabilities, but does not explicitly state the rule used for the choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the comparison of the maximum probabilities (99.9% vs. 99.8%), which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual talks about the difference in probabilities but in the context of the potential loss being frightening, not directly comparing the probabilities of the 0 Euro outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on the fear of the potential loss and the minimal probability difference, not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. The individual's focus is on the potential loss and the minimal difference in probabilities, without explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities or stating a preference based on this comparison. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes).
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome).
The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual.
The individual mentions that getting ""sicher Geld"" (secure money) appears more attractive, implying they considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice.
The individual justifies their choice by mentioning that the additional credit did not make them more risk-tolerant, suggesting they preferred the secure option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual.
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the attractiveness of secure money, which indirectly relates to the certainty (100% probability) of Lottery B's outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with 50%. However, the individual's justification suggests they preferred the secure option, Lottery B, because it offers a guaranteed outcome, not because it has a lower maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the security of the outcome and their preference for the guaranteed money in Lottery B, rather than explicitly considering and comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, indicates that the decision reason based on the maximum probability was not used by the individual. The individual's reasoning aligns more with a preference for certainty rather than a comparison of maximum probabilities."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both -1000 Euros and 0 Euros). For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for -500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions uncertainty about the relevance of their current balance for their decisions and the influence of additional balance, which might have led them to choose the riskier option (Variante B). They also mention that having a 100% loss (Variante A) is not attractive.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be influenced by the attractiveness of not having a guaranteed loss and possibly by the potential for a more favorable outcome due to additional funds. They do not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention comparing these probabilities. Instead, the individual discusses the attractiveness of the outcomes and the influence of additional funds.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification does not clearly indicate that they chose based on the comparison of maximum probabilities. The individual seems more focused on the risk aspect and the potential benefits of additional funds.

- Lottery B: 50% (maximum probability)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the difficulty of making decisions involving losses, the high value of 6000 Euros in Lottery A, and the higher probability of incurring a loss in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification seems to be influenced by the aversion to the high potential loss in Lottery A and the recognition that losses are more probable in Lottery B, but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual does not explicitly mention considering the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the key factor in the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability (which would be Lottery B with 50%), but the individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, focusing more on the aversion to high losses and the comparative probabilities of incurring any loss.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries to make the decision.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 5 Euros outcome). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the potential loss and gain from choosing Lottery B, acknowledging the high probability of not winning (99.9%) and the low probability of the significant gain (0.1%). The individual's justification for not choosing Lottery B was that the probability of the large win was too small to be enticing, despite acknowledging the relatively minor loss potential of choosing the riskier option.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the high probability of not winning with Lottery B and the low probability of winning), it appears the individual focused more on the specific probabilities of outcomes rather than the maximum probability as a standalone criterion. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) does not directly align with the individual's justification (focusing on the small chance of a large win as the deterrent). The individual's decision seems to be influenced by the perceived value of the potential outcomes and their probabilities rather than a strict application of the maximum probability rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report indicates a consideration of outcome probabilities but not in the manner specified by the decision reason (focusing on the maximum probability as the sole criterion for preference). The individual's reasoning seems to incorporate a more nuanced view of risk and reward rather than strictly adhering to the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability."

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""enormously low probability of loss"" in Lottery B and compares it with the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the extremely low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certain but minor loss in Lottery A, suggesting that the minor loss is ""irrelevant"" in comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is 100% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B. The individual discusses the low probability of loss in Lottery B and the certainty of a small loss in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities but not explicitly the ""maximum probability"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.9% vs. 100%). The individual's justification, however, seems to prioritize the practical insignificance of the certain loss in Lottery A over the extremely low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B, not directly referencing the comparison of maximum probabilities as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the decision reason based on the maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision. While they discuss probabilities, their justification focuses more on the practical implications of those probabilities rather than the probabilities themselves as the decision reason would suggest. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability = 50%
- Lottery B: Maximum probability = 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss (50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A) and preferred a smaller but certain gain (1500 Euros in Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by stating a preference for a smaller certain gain over a riskier option with a potential for significant loss, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the risk associated with the potential loss in Lottery A and the certainty of gain in Lottery B. While the individual's consideration touches upon the concept of probability (through risk assessment), it does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% vs. 100% in Lottery B). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain over a risky option, not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the lower value of maximum probability. The individual's focus was on risk aversion and the preference for a certain gain, rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros outcomes). 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2000 Euros outcome). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 50%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 100%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the attractiveness of a definitive win, especially after many loss-decisions in previous rounds, and expresses no desire to play with more risk. 
This implies the individual is considering the risk aspect and the certainty of the outcome. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justifies the choice based on the appeal of a guaranteed win and the desire to avoid more risk after previous losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considers the risk and the attractiveness of a definitive win. 
There is an indirect relation, as the individual's concern about risk could be linked to the probabilities, but it does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A in this case. 
However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the certainty of a win (which aligns more with Lottery B's 100% probability of a positive outcome), indicating a preference for less risk or more certainty, not necessarily the lower maximum probability as defined by the decision reason.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Thus, the relevant information is: Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the gain in Lottery A compared to the potential loss in Lottery B, noting that the probability of winning in Lottery B is only 50%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the certain gain in Lottery A to the risky outcome in Lottery B, where the potential loss is three times higher than the gain and the probability of winning is only 50%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery B and the comparative attractiveness of the outcomes. The individual's consideration does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities but focuses on the risk associated with Lottery B's 50% chance of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the attractiveness of the certain gain over the risky outcome of Lottery B, not explicitly on the comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. The focus of the individual's deliberation was on the risk and attractiveness of the outcomes rather than on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

6000 zu große Summe, um sie aufs Spiel zu setzen, da Gewinne ansonsten kleiner; einen Durchgang Pause zu machen scheint in Ordnung

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make their decision, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 0 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 50% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 6000 Euros is too large a sum to risk, implying they considered the potential loss and gain amounts of Lottery B. They also mention that taking a break (implied by ""einen Durchgang Pause zu machen"") seems acceptable, which can be interpreted as considering the certain outcome of Lottery A as a form of taking a break from risking.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by implying that risking 6000 Euros is not worth it, suggesting they prioritize avoiding potential significant losses over potential gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities, whereas the individual seems to focus on the magnitude of potential outcomes and the concept of avoiding risk by choosing a certain outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is centered around avoiding a large potential loss, not explicitly comparing the probabilities of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. Instead, the individual's focus was on avoiding risk and the magnitude of potential outcomes.
