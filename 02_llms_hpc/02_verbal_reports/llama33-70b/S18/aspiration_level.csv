STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1812.5 Euros (considering each outcome from both lotteries for the calculation as per the reason's requirement to calculate the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem). The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1812.5 = 687.5, 2400 - 1812.5 = 587.5, and 0 - 1812.5 = -1812.5; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1812.5 = 587.5. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""Sicherer Gewinn in vergleichbarer Höhe,"" which translates to ""Secure win in a comparable amount."" This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome (security) and its amount in making the decision. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the guaranteed nature of the win rather than the potential for higher or lower outcomes based on probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (security and comparable amount), there seems to be a disconnect. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, which is not directly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the security of the win, which aligns more with the concept of risk aversion or preference for certainty rather than the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, the decision reason's rule does not directly match the individual's justification for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: 2500 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 2400 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level = (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: 2500 - 1225 = 1275 (positive), 0 - 1225 = -1225 (negative)
- For Lottery A: 2400 - 1225 = 1175 (positive), 0 - 1225 = -1225 (negative)
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities:
- Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference and a 67% chance of a negative difference.
- Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference and a 66% chance of a negative difference.
Thus, Lottery A has a slightly higher probability of a positive difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""lower probability"" but ""higher winning chances,"" which suggests they considered the probabilities of winning and possibly the amounts, but the exact deliberation is not detailed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to weigh the lower probability of winning against the potential for higher winnings, though it's not explicitly clear how these were balanced or if the aspiration level was considered.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes relative to this level. The verbal report does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or such a calculation, but it does hint at considering probabilities and outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification mentions ""higher winning chances,"" which could align with preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome, but it does not directly reference an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While there's a mention of ""higher winning chances,"" which could superficially align with the decision reason's preference for higher probabilities of positive outcomes, the absence of explicit reference to an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it suggests that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used, but not entirely certain due to the vague alignment with the concept of preferring higher winning chances."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Lieber den sicheren Gewinn mitnehmen,"" which translates to ""Rather take the safe gain."" The individual considered the safety of the gain, implying they focused on the certainty of the outcome of one of the lotteries. The justification for the choice seems to be based on the preference for a guaranteed outcome over a risky one, without explicitly mentioning probabilities or the aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (safety of the gain, certainty of the outcome), it appears there is a significant difference in focus. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification focuses on the safety of the gain. The verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0)/4 = 7000/4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""die Möglichkeit besteht Verluste zu machen"" (the possibility of making losses exists) and prefers ""die geringerer Wahrscheinlichkeit mit dem höheren Gewinn"" (the lower probability with the higher gain), indicating consideration of both the probability of loss (or gain) and the magnitude of the gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to focus on avoiding losses and preferring a higher gain despite a lower probability, which suggests a consideration of both the probability and the magnitude of outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences to it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers probabilities and outcomes but does not mention an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences relative to the aspiration level, whereas the individual seems to prioritize avoiding losses and prefers a higher gain despite a lower probability, without mentioning the aspiration level or the specific rule about positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not explicitly mention the calculation of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences as per the decision reason. While the individual considers probabilities and outcomes, the justification provided does not align closely with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the aspiration level and positive differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used this decision reason to make the decision, but there is a slight possibility due to the general consideration of outcomes and probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 3000 Euros, -1500; for 0 Euros, -4500; and for 6000 Euros, 1500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0 (since the only positive outcome of 3000 is less than the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since the outcome of 6000 Euros is greater than the aspiration level). Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""lower gain"" (which could refer to the maximum outcome of Lottery A being lower than that of Lottery B) and a ""significantly higher probability"" (which could refer to the higher probability of winning in Lottery A). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the trade-off between the magnitude of the potential gain and the probability of winning, suggesting that the higher probability of winning in one of the lotteries is a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level, but they do consider the trade-off between the potential gain and the probability, which aligns with the general idea of weighing outcomes against some form of benchmark (even if not explicitly stated as an aspiration level).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification emphasizes the importance of a ""significantly higher probability,"" which could be interpreted as aligning with the decision reason if we consider that the individual implicitly understands one lottery offers a more favorable probability regarding achieving a desirable outcome (though the aspiration level concept is not directly mentioned).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention the aspiration level or explicitly compare outcomes to such a level, but it does indicate a consideration of the probability of winning as a significant factor. This suggests some alignment with the decision reason's emphasis on probabilities of positive outcomes, but the direct application of the aspiration level concept as described in the decision reason is not clearly evident. Therefore, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason not being used but with some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probability of a positive difference in Lottery A is 0.1% and in Lottery B is 0.2%, the reason would prefer Lottery B based on its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Keine Möglichkeit Verluste zu machen"" which translates to ""no chance of making losses,"" indicating they considered the aspect of not losing money. They also mention ""lieber die höhere mögliche Gewinnsumme"" which translates to ""prefer the higher possible win sum,"" indicating they considered the potential gains.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on avoiding losses and preferring the higher possible win, which suggests they are considering the outcomes of the lotteries but not explicitly mentioning probabilities or an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes being above this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention such a calculation or comparison but does focus on the potential gains and avoiding losses, which could tangentially relate to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the higher possible win sum and mentions no chance of losses, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring based on probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as it is defined. The verbal report does not mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above this level, which are key components of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 + (-3000)) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33; for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is always negative and closer to the aspiration level than the positive outcome in B), we can derive the information relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions preferring the chance of making no loss over a certain loss, which implies considering the outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice based on the preference for avoiding a certain loss, focusing on the possibility of no loss in one of the options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's consideration is more straightforward, focusing on the avoidance of certain loss and the chance of no loss, which does not explicitly mention aspiration levels or the calculation of differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual prefers the option that offers a chance to avoid loss altogether, which aligns more with risk aversion or loss aversion rather than the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from this level to make the decision. The focus on avoiding certain loss and preferring a chance of no loss does not align with the specific decision reason provided, which is based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -4000 Euros, the difference is -4000 - (-1750) = -2250; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-1750) = -1250; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with positive differences from the aspiration level. The probability of this positive difference in Lottery A is 75% (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros), and in Lottery B, it's 80% (since it's the probability of getting 0 Euros). Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B due to its higher probability of a positive difference (80% vs 75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""higher probability"" and ""in comparison, however, a smaller loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes and the magnitude of the losses.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the higher probability of an outcome against the magnitude of the potential loss, indicating a consideration of both probability and loss magnitude in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses probabilities and loss magnitudes, which aligns partially with the decision reason's focus on probabilities but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher probability of the 0 Euro outcome. The individual's justification mentions weighing probabilities against loss magnitudes, which could indirectly align with preferring a lottery based on the probability of avoiding a loss (in this context, the 0 Euro outcome), but it does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's consideration of probabilities and loss magnitudes shares some conceptual space with the decision reason, the specific mechanism of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences from it is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, the assessment leans towards uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly used.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the aspiration level as per the decision reason. The aspiration level is the mean of all outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (-3000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 4 = -4500 / 4 = -1125 Euros. However, to apply the decision reason correctly, we need to understand it considers the differences between outcomes and this aspiration level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is -1125 Euros, for Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros is below this level, and the outcome of 0 Euros is above it. For Lottery B, both -6000 Euros and 0 Euros are above and below this level, respectively, but since -6000 is further away in the negative direction, it's a significant negative difference, and 0 Euros is a positive difference from the aspiration level. Thus, the decision reason would compare the probabilities of being above this aspiration level in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Auch wenn der Verlust höher ist, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit für diesen doch geringer."" Translated to English, this means, ""Even though the loss is higher, the probability of it is lower."" This suggests the individual considered the magnitude of the losses and their respective probabilities. The individual seems to weigh the higher loss against its lower probability, which indicates a consideration of the trade-off between the size of the potential loss and its likelihood.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences from this level) with that considered by the individual (the magnitude of losses and their probabilities), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual discusses the probability of the loss, which could relate to the concept of preferring a lottery based on the probability of outcomes relative to an aspiration level. However, the individual's focus is more on the direct comparison of loss magnitudes and their probabilities rather than explicitly calculating or considering an aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences from it. The justification for the choice, as described, does not directly match the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level but does show an awareness of probability and outcome magnitude, which is a component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report shows consideration of probabilities and outcome magnitudes, which is somewhat aligned with components of the decision reason, it does not directly apply the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the aspiration level and the preference for the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's reasoning seems to intuitively grasp parts of what the decision reason formalizes but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason not being used as defined but with some elements of the decision process being considered."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. For Lottery A, the differences are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are -3000 - (-2250) = -750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have the same probability of a positive difference (99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B), but the magnitude and probability of negative differences vary. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a loss and the magnitude of the loss in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potentially smaller loss, indicating that the magnitude of the loss was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of the loss and its probability, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing the magnitude of the loss, which aligns with considering negative outcomes rather than the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on minimizing the magnitude of the loss rather than considering an aspiration level and the probability of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative); for Lottery A, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros (no difference). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B offers a 50% chance of a positive difference (500 Euros more than the aspiration level) and Lottery A offers no positive difference (0 Euros difference from the aspiration level), we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the aspect of a ""sicherer Gewinn"" (safe win or certain gain), implying they are focusing on the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that a certain gain appears better than the possibility of no gain, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of not winning anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of gain, which indirectly relates to avoiding negative outcomes (like the 0 Euros in Lottery B) but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the certain gain, which aligns with avoiding the risk of negative differences but does not directly address the decision reason’s specific rule about probabilities of positive differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on a ""sicherer Gewinn"" and preference for avoiding the possibility of no gain aligns with preferring outcomes that are more certain and positive, but the explicit calculation and comparison based on the aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences are not mentioned in the verbal report. Thus, while there is some alignment in the preference for certain gains over risky outcomes, the specific application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report.

In this case, Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (0 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference (since the difference is 0). The relevant information for the decision reason is the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""zusätzlichem Guthaben"" (additional credit) and the idea that a loss hurts less with more credit, but this is not directly related to the calculation of the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. However, the individual does express a preference for the possibility of no loss over a certain loss, which implies considering the outcomes of the lotteries and possibly their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating they prefer the chance of no loss (implied to be Lottery A, given its 50% chance of 0 Euros) over a certain loss (implied to be Lottery B, with its 100% chance of -500 Euros). This justification focuses on the avoidance of certain loss and the preference for a chance at no loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences between outcomes and this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual does consider the concept of loss and the preference for avoiding a certain loss, which tangentially relates to the idea of positive and negative differences from an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 50% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros). The individual’s justification also leads them to prefer Lottery A, but based on a desire to avoid certain loss rather than explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly reflect the calculation of an aspiration level or the consideration of differences from this level as described by the decision reason. However, the preference for avoiding certain loss and the desire for a chance at no loss aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason in this scenario. The alignment in the final preference (Lottery A over Lottery B) but the lack of direct reference to the aspiration level or the specific rule about positive differences leads to a low but not zero assessment, indicating that while the decision reason might have influenced the choice, it was not explicitly used as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 4000 + 2000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 6 = 12000 / 6 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then considered. For Lottery A, the differences are (4000-2000), (2000-2000), and (0-2000). For Lottery B, the differences are (6000-2000) and (0-2000). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possible gain (mögliche Gewinn) in Variant B is higher and the probability for this gain is also greater. This indicates the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice based on the higher possible gain and its higher probability in Variant B, without mentioning the aspiration level or differences from it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from it) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities). The individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of differences from it, which is central to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher gain and its higher probability). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the absolute gain and its probability rather than the probability of outcomes being above the aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the concept of differences from it, which are crucial components of the decision reason. The justification provided by the individual focuses on different aspects (higher gain and its probability) than those considered by the decision reason (probability of positive differences from the aspiration level). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus calculated as: 
(-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
For Lottery B: -6000 - (-2200) = -3800, 0 - (-2200) = 2200.
For Lottery A: -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, 0 - (-2200) = 2200.
The decision reason considers these differences and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Zusammen geringere Wahrscheinlichkeit einen Verlust zu machen und dann auch jeweils in einer geringeren Höhe"", which translates to ""Together, a lower probability of making a loss and also in a lower amount"". This suggests the individual considered the probabilities and amounts of losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify the choice based on having a lower probability of making a loss and the loss being of a lower amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered probabilities and amounts of losses, which aligns partially with considering outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the focus on positive differences as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on minimizing loss probability and amount, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is closer to 0 because the individual's justification and considerations do not directly align with the specific calculations and rules defined by the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and focusing on the probability of positive differences from this level. However, the individual does consider aspects of the outcomes (like loss probabilities and amounts), which shows some indirect relation to the decision reason's concerns, thus it's not a complete 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 5 Euros and 5000 Euros (for B) and 0 Euros (for B). The aspiration level is calculated as (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 1685 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1685 = -1680 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1685 = 3315 Euros and 0 - 1685 = -1685 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B offers a positive difference (3315 Euros) with a 0.1% probability and a negative difference (-1685 Euros) with a 99.9% probability, and Lottery A offers a negative difference (-1680 Euros) with a 100% probability, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compares the amount of 5 Euros to ""den anderen Summen"" (the other sums), implying they considered the higher amount of 5000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that 5 Euros ""machen keinen großen Unterschied"" (do not make a big difference) compared to the other sums, and therefore prefers ""die Chance auf den deutlich höheren Gewinn"" (the chance at the significantly higher win). This suggests the individual was drawn to the higher potential gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, seems to focus on the absolute values of the potential gains and their relative differences, rather than explicitly calculating or considering probabilities of being above an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while focusing on the appeal of the higher potential gain, does not explicitly mention probabilities or an aspiration level but does indicate a preference for the chance at a higher win, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but doesn't directly address the probability aspect as defined by the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus on the higher potential gain and the relative indifference to the smaller, guaranteed amount suggests some alignment with the concept of seeking positive differences (in this case, the significant gain of 5000 Euros), but the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities or an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a conceptual alignment in preferring the higher potential win, the explicit process described by the decision reason (calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences) is not clearly reflected in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification share some intuitive alignment with the concept of seeking higher gains (which could be related to the idea of positive differences from an aspiration level), the explicit steps and considerations of the decision reason are not clearly evident in the verbal report, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary or conscious basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the outcomes and their probabilities, we can derive the information relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the loss of 5 Euros in relation to the other sum (implying the -5000 Euros loss in Lottery A) and notes that the 5 Euros are not a significant loss, especially when compared to the other potential loss. The individual also mentions the low probability of the other loss (referring to the 0.1% chance of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery A).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by downplaying the significance of the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B compared to the potential large loss in Lottery A, taking into account the low probability of the latter.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the relative sizes of the losses and the probability of the significant loss in Lottery A, without explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while considering the probabilities and the magnitude of losses, does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations outlined in the decision reason. The individual's focus is more on the comparative magnitudes of potential losses and their probabilities rather than on calculating an aspiration level and evaluating the probabilities of positive differences from it.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery A, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report is ""Sicherer Gewinn"", which translates to ""Secure win"" in English. This phrase suggests that the individual considered the certainty of winning in their deliberation process. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level, probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences. The individual's focus was on the secure win, which aligns more with the concept of risk avoidance rather than the specific calculation of aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) does not directly match the individual’s justification for the choice (secure win), suggesting that the decision reason might not have been the primary basis for the decision.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 0. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 0 = 3000 and -3000 - 0 = -3000; for Lottery B, 2000 - 0 = 2000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (3000) and Lottery B has a 100% probability of a positive difference (2000), the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the amount of 2000 Euros to be ""very much money"" and seems to focus on the aspect of a ""safe win"" (sicheren Gewinn).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the safe win, implying that the certainty of gaining 2000 Euros is more important than the potential for a higher gain (or loss) in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery B in this case since it has a 100% chance of a positive outcome. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B, but based on the desire for a ""safe win"" rather than an explicit consideration of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Based on these comparisons, while the outcome chosen by the individual aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the outcome the decision reason would prefer, the verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences to make the decision. The individual's focus on the ""safe win"" suggests a different reasoning process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (1000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = approximately 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 Euros and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is higher than the aspiration level), and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (since only one of its outcomes is higher than the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report translates to ""Rather safe gain than possibility of making losses."" This indicates the individual considered the aspect of safety and the avoidance of losses. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the preference for a certain gain over the risk of incurring losses, implying that the deliberation process involved weighing the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A against the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (safety and avoidance of losses), there is an indirect alignment. The decision reason specifically calculates an aspiration level and compares outcomes to it, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual's focus on avoiding losses and preferring a safe gain suggests an implicit consideration of the downside risks, which aligns with the spirit of considering negative differences from an aspiration level. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its guaranteed positive outcome relative to the calculated aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing a safe gain over the possibility of losses also points towards preferring Lottery A, suggesting that while the exact reasoning process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences is not explicitly described, the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) aligns with the individual's choice and justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects a moderate level of certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's focus on safety and avoidance of losses indirectly aligns with the decision reason's consideration of positive differences from an aspiration level, even though the exact process of the decision reason is not explicitly described in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros, -6000 Euros, and 0 Euros for the respective outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0 Euro outcome with 100% probability and no positive difference, and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive 6000 Euro difference, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the purpose and sense of a lottery to be about winning chances. They question whether a 100% chance of 0 Euros constitutes a lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual implies that Lottery A, with a 100% chance of 0 Euros, does not align with their understanding of what a lottery should be, suggesting a focus on the concept of a lottery rather than a detailed numerical analysis of outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not mention such calculations or considerations, instead focusing on the concept of what constitutes a lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification seems to be based on the concept of a lottery and winning chances, not on the specific rule of preferring positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The focus is on the conceptual understanding of a lottery rather than the specific numerical analysis required by the decision reason."
