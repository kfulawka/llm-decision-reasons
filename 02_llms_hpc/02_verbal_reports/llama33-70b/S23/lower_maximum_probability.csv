1,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for the 2400 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2400 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a lower maximum probability (66%) compared to Lottery A (100%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain (sichere Gewinn) of Lottery A and the high probability of earning the same amount or more in Lottery B. They also considered that the potential higher gain in Lottery B was not significantly higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred the secure gain, and the potential additional gain in Lottery B was not significant enough to sway their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's deliberation process, as described, focuses more on the security of the gain and the significance of the potential additional gain in Lottery B, not directly on the comparison of maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the preference for a secure gain and not because of a direct comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the maximum probability of each lottery or preferred one lottery over the other based on the decision reason's rule. The focus was on the security of the gain and the potential additional benefits, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (the probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (the probability of winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning one of the two lotteries is almost identical.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose the lottery with the higher gain because the winning probabilities are almost the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the similarity in winning probabilities). The individual focuses on the similarity in winning probabilities but does not explicitly consider the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the higher gain due to similar winning probabilities). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritizes the higher gain over the comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the similarity in winning probabilities and a preference for the higher gain, which does not align with the decision reason's consideration of maximum probabilities and preference for the lower maximum probability. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In the given decision problem, Lottery B has a maximum probability of 80% (for winning 4000 Euros), and Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Since Lottery A has a higher maximum probability (100%) than Lottery B (80%), according to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred if the reason were applied.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the high probability of winning in Lottery B but decides in favor of Lottery A due to the difference not being large enough to take the risk. This indicates the individual is weighing the certainty of a smaller gain against the risk of a larger gain. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the preference for a certain, albeit smaller, gain over a risky, potentially larger gain, due to the risk not being justified by the difference in potential winnings.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the certainty of gain vs. the risk of a larger gain), it appears the individual is not directly considering the maximum probabilities as the decision reason would require. Instead, the individual is focused on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A versus the risk in Lottery B. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability) does not directly align with the individual's justification (preferring the certain gain due to the risk not being worth the potential increase). However, the individual's choice does align with preferring a ""safer"" option, which in this context is the lottery with the certain outcome (100% probability), not the one with the lower maximum probability as the reason would dictate.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. The individual's focus is on the certainty of the gain versus the risk, rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (the probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 75% (the probability of winning 0 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these probabilities: 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has the lower maximum probability (75% vs. 80%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities of winning are in a similar range but decides to choose the option with the lower probability of winning in exchange for a higher gain amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount to be won, indicating a preference for a higher gain despite a lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries (80% for A and 75% for B), while the individual considers the probabilities of winning (20% for A and 25% for B) and the trade-off with the gain amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on choosing a higher gain for a lower probability of winning, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it offers a higher gain (4000 Euros) for its winning probability compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's consideration and justification do not align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its lower maximum probability (75% vs. 80%), but the individual's reasoning is based on a different criterion (trading off probability of winning for the amount to be won), which does not directly relate to the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this decision problem, the maximum probability for Lottery B is 55% (the probability of getting 0 Euros) and for Lottery A is 90% (the probability of getting 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of 55% for Lottery B and 90% for Lottery A.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual would rather choose the lottery with the generally higher winning chance than taking a higher risk for a higher win. The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the concept of ""Gewinnchance,"" which translates to ""winning chance"" or the probability of winning. The individual’s justification for the choice emphasizes the preference for a higher winning chance over taking a higher risk for a potentially higher reward.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (winning chances), it appears there might be a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of the decision reason's focus. The decision reason specifically looks at the maximum probability, which in this context would be about the highest probability associated with any outcome of the lotteries, not necessarily the winning chances. The individual's justification, however, talks about preferring a higher winning chance, which aligns more with the probability of the positive outcome rather than the maximum probability of any outcome. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (55% for 0 Euros) over Lottery A (90% for 3000 Euros), but the individual's justification seems to prioritize the lottery with the higher winning chance, which would be Lottery A (90% chance of winning 3000 Euros).

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. 
In the given decision problem, the maximum probability for Lottery A is 99.8% (for winning 0 Euros) and for Lottery B is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros). 
Since the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and notes that the chances are quasi the same.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual decides to choose the lottery with the higher potential win because the probabilities of winning are perceived as nearly equal.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (low probabilities of winning and their perceived equality): 
The individual focuses on the low probability of winning rather than the maximum probability (which pertains to losing in this context), indicating a potential mismatch.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the higher potential win due to quasi-equal chances): 
The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery A (with a maximum probability of 99.8% for winning 0 Euros) over Lottery B (with a maximum probability of 99.9% for winning 0 Euros), but the individual's focus is on the higher potential win, not on the probabilities of the outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a lower maximum probability, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A if it were the sole basis for the decision.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the loss of Lottery B versus the small chance of no loss in Lottery A. They considered the difference in losses between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's decision was based on the relatively small difference in losses, which made the risk worth taking for Lottery A. The justification revolves around the comparison of potential losses and the perceived risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, specifically losses and the chance of no loss): The individual's consideration does not directly mention probabilities but focuses on outcomes and their differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (based on the comparison of losses and risk perception): The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not align directly. The individual's decision seems to be more influenced by the potential outcomes and the risk associated with those outcomes rather than the probabilities of those outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the maximum probability of each lottery, was used to make the decision. The focus on loss differences and risk perception, without mention of probability comparisons, suggests that the decision reason was not a factor in the individual's choice."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared both lotteries, considering the losses and probabilities, which were perceived as being close to each other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the potentially smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries (75% for B and 80% for A), which does not directly align with the individual's focus on losses and their probabilities being close.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability (Lottery B), but the individual's justification is based on the potential for a smaller loss, not the probabilities of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the individual focused on the potential losses rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 90% (of losing -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 55%
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 90%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to be comparing the probabilities of not incurring a loss in each lottery, implying they consider the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by weighing the higher probability of not incurring a loss in Lottery A against the high probability of losing a significant amount in Lottery B, even though the potential loss in Lottery A could be double.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of not incurring a loss), it appears the individual is focusing on the aspect of avoiding loss, which aligns with considering probabilities but does not directly address the ""maximum probability"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (weighing the probabilities of loss), the individual's reasoning does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum probability of the lotteries but rather on the implications of those probabilities (i.e., the risk of loss).

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the lower value of the maximum probability. However, the individual does consider probabilities, which is a key component of the decision reason. The focus, though, is more on the implications of those probabilities (avoiding loss) rather than the probabilities themselves as the basis for the decision. Thus, there's a partial alignment in the consideration of probabilities but a lack of direct application of the decision reason's specific rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). Since the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ""Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit"" (loss probability), which is very low for both lotteries, indicating they considered the probabilities of the negative outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the ""niedrigeren Verlustbetrag"" (lower loss amount), implying they compared the potential losses of the two lotteries and chose the one with the smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (loss probabilities and loss amounts). The individual focused on the loss aspects rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose based on the lower loss amount). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason is about comparing the maximum probabilities, not the loss amounts.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the loss amounts and their probabilities rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the basis of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared both lotteries, looking at the possible winnings and chances of winning one after the other. They considered the secure win of Lottery A as personally important.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that the secure win was personally more important to them. This implies they valued the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher reward with less certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason requires comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual compared the lotteries but focused on the secure win aspect rather than explicitly discussing probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (50% vs. 100%). However, the individual chose Lottery A because the secure win was personally important, not because it had a lower maximum probability.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision process does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual prioritized the certainty of the win over the comparison of maximum probabilities, which is contrary to the decision reason's rule.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome of -500 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 50%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason, as it allows for a comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the certain loss of a higher amount (in Lottery B) versus the risk of a 50% chance of no loss in Lottery A, indicating they weigh the risk against the potential loss amounts.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the risk (of losing nothing in Lottery A) outweighs the possibility of a doubly high loss amount (comparing the potential loss in Lottery A to the certain loss in Lottery B), suggesting a focus on the potential for avoiding loss rather than the probability of the loss itself.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual discusses the risk and potential loss amounts, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% vs. 100% in Lottery B). The individual’s justification, however, does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the maximum probability of outcomes but rather on the balance between risk and potential loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Instead, their justification focuses on the risk of loss and the potential to avoid loss, without mentioning the specific probabilities as the basis for their decision.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for winning 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for winning 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This information is: Lottery A has a maximum probability of 75%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, noting that the probability of winning something in Lottery B is higher than in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is that the higher probability of winning something in Lottery B outweighs the potential for lower winnings compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning in each lottery). The individual focused on the probability of winning, not specifically the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the key factor in the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring the higher probability of winning something). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its lower maximum probability (50% for winning 0 Euros), but the individual's reasoning is about the probability of winning, not the maximum probability of any outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus and justification do not align with the decision reason's criteria of comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the higher probability of not losing money outweighs the potentially higher loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, while the individual considered the probability of not losing money, which relates to the probability of the 0 Euros outcome but does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% for 0 Euros), but the individual's justification emphasizes the importance of not losing money, which aligns with preferring Lottery A due to its 50% chance of not losing money, but does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice and justification share some alignment with the decision reason (preferring the lottery with a higher chance of not losing money, which coincidentally has the lower maximum probability), the verbal report does not clearly demonstrate that the decision was made based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason dictates. The focus on the probability of not losing money could be a different reasoning path that happened to lead to the same choice as the decision reason would suggest, but it does not directly reflect the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 5 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities: 99.9% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the large difference between the potential gains and notes the significantly lower probability of Lottery A, but also considers that in the worst case, there's no loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because of the large difference in potential gains and the fact that, in the worst case, there's no loss, implying a consideration of the potential upside and the absence of downside risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considers the difference in potential gains, the lower probability of Lottery A, and the absence of loss in the worst case. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A in this case because its maximum probability (99.9%) is lower than Lottery B's (100%). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the comparison of maximum probabilities but rather on the potential gains and the absence of loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on maximum probabilities. The individual chooses Lottery A but based on different criteria than those outlined by the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the -5 Euros outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 99.9%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 100%
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of loss in Lottery A, acknowledging it as ""unwahrscheinlich"" (unlikely) but still a possibility, and compared the loss amount of Lottery B, noting it as ""niedrig"" (low).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a certain loss, but one that is low, over the possibility, however small, of a larger loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification. Instead, the individual discusses the likelihood of a loss and the magnitude of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.9% vs 100%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the certain but low loss as the reason, not the comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the certainty and magnitude of potential losses rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning and losing), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning). 
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A: 50% (maximum probability)
- Lottery B: 100% (maximum probability)
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the secure win of Lottery B, the potential higher win of Lottery A, and the 50% probability of winning or losing with Lottery A. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the preference for Lottery B by weighing the secure win higher than the potential higher win of Lottery A due to the low probability of winning with Lottery A and the risk of losing a high sum.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. 
The individual considered the probability of winning with Lottery A (50%) but did not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities between the two lotteries. 
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. 
However, the individual preferred Lottery B due to its secure win and the risk associated with Lottery A, not explicitly because of the comparison of maximum probabilities. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described, focusing instead on the security of the win and the risk of loss rather than the maximum probability of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The maximum probability of Lottery A is 100% (for the outcome of 2000 Euros), and the maximum probability of Lottery B is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process, focusing on the certain gain of Lottery A outweighing the potential higher gain of Lottery B, especially considering the loss risk associated with Lottery B. The individual considered the certain gain of Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B. The justification for the choice seems to emphasize the importance of certainty and the avoidance of potential loss.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk of loss). While the individual does consider aspects related to the probabilities (certainty vs. risk), the focus is not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (50% vs. 100%). However, the individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of gain and the avoidance of loss, which aligns more closely with preferring Lottery A due to its 100% probability of a positive outcome, rather than directly comparing maximum probabilities. This indicates a potential mismatch between the decision reason's rule and the individual's justification for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss associated with Lottery A and the certainty of gain from Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss risk of Lottery A was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and certainty of gain): The individual's considerations do not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries but focus on the risk aspect and certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (chose based on the risk of loss being too high): The decision reason's rule does not align with the individual's justification. The individual's choice is based on risk aversion rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome rather than a comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is what the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the gain and loss), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considers the potential for a high loss and the potential for no gain, indicating they weigh the risk of losing a significant amount against the possibility of not winning anything. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the possible loss weighs more than the potential gain, even though the probabilities are the same, indicating a risk-averse attitude towards the high-loss outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential for high loss and no gain, weighing loss against gain). While the individual does consider aspects related to the outcomes and their implications, they do not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (aversion to high loss, even with equal probabilities for gain and loss). The individual's justification is more aligned with a risk-averse perspective rather than a direct comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the lower value of maximum probability. The focus is more on the aversion to potential loss rather than a comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Thus, while there is some alignment in the preference for avoiding loss (which coincidentally aligns with preferring the lottery with a lower maximum probability in this specific case), the reasoning process described does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule."
