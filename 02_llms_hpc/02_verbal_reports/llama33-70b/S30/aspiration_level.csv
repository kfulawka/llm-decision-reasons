STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1810 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are then considered. For Lottery B, the differences are (2500 - 1810), (2400 - 1810), and (0 - 1810). For Lottery A, the difference is (2400 - 1810). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. This step shows that the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries. They also mention taking the lottery with the higher expected payout, but in this case, they prioritize certainty over a potentially higher payout with some risk (1% chance of getting nothing).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that certainty (Lottery A) is better than the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 1% chance of getting nothing and the comparison of getting only a quarter more (2500 vs. 2400) with a one-third probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, expected payout, and risk aversion). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it, which are key components of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prioritizing certainty and comparing expected outcomes with risk). The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it. The individual's focus is more on the expected payout, risk aversion, and the value of certainty, which does not match the specific criteria outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0)/4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 and 0 - 1225 = -1225; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first considers the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries, then the probabilities (wkts), and then chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout (erwartete auszahlung). The individual's justification for the choice is based on the expected payout, which is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, expected payout), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. The individual's justification for the choice is based on the expected payout, which is different from the rule used by the decision reason (prefer the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 80% (since the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery A, the difference is always positive but does not vary, so its ""probability"" of being positive is 100%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their weights (probabilities) to calculate the expected payout. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, preferring a safer win over a chance at a higher win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but focused on expected payouts rather than an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout, which aligns with preferring a safer, more certain outcome but does not directly mention the concept of an aspiration level or the probability of exceeding it.

Given these comparisons, the individual's process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences from those levels. The individual's justification is more aligned with expected utility maximization than with the specific decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, calculate the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. 
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for Lottery A are (4000 - 1750) = 2250 Euros and (0 - 1750) = -1750 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are (3000 - 1750) = 1250 Euros and (0 - 1750) = -1750 Euros. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it's 25% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, Lottery B has a higher probability of a positive difference according to the aspiration level decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first considers the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries, then their probabilities (""wkts"" likely refers to probabilities or weights), and finally chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung""). 
The individual's deliberation process involves calculating or considering the expected value of each lottery, which is a different approach than the decision reason provided.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities for expected value calculation) shows they are not directly aligned. The individual focuses on expected value, not on the aspiration level or the probability of outcomes being above this level. 
The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) does not match the individual's justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with the higher expected payout). 
Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason based on aspiration levels to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, let's follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery B, it is 90% (since the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B based on the higher probability of a positive difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, indicating they looked at both the monetary outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they choose the lottery with the higher expected payout, mentioning that this gives a certain win, even if not as high as possible. This implies the individual considered the expected value of each lottery, which is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability, and chose based on this criterion.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but does not mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual chose based on the higher expected payout, which does not directly relate to the aspiration level concept.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on expected payouts rather than on the concept of aspiration levels and positive differences from it.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery A, the differences are 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. For Lottery B, the differences are 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first considers the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) and chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout if they are not equal. The individual also mentions that the chances are small, so they try for the higher gain if they are lucky. The information considered by the individual includes the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice is based on the expected payout and the desire for a higher gain despite small chances.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, expected payout), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. The individual's justification for the choice is based on the expected payout, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33; for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, there's a 20% chance of a positive difference (2333.33) and in Lottery A, there's a 0% chance since the difference is negative (-666.67). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first considers the sums (outcomes), then the weights (probabilities), and then chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout. The individual mentions that the ""erwartungswert links besser,"" which translates to ""expected value on the left is better,"" indicating they are comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. The expected value of Lottery B is (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros, and for Lottery A, it's -3000 Euros. The individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on the comparison of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and expected values), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual focuses on expected values rather than the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) does not align with the individual's justification (choosing based on the higher expected payout).

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery B: -4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as: (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery B: -4000 - (-1750) = -2250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
- For Lottery A: -3000 - (-1750) = -1250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout, which is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we first need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason considers these differences and their probabilities to decide which lottery is preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their weights (probabilities) to calculate the expected payout. The individual aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout and preferred lower losses when the expected payouts were equal.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the expected payouts of the two lotteries. If the expected payouts are equal, the individual prefers the lottery with the lower loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of an aspiration level and the consideration of differences between outcomes and this aspiration level. In contrast, the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate expected payouts, not directly addressing differences from an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout or, in case of a tie, the one with the lower loss. The individual's justification does not directly align with considering probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described, focusing instead on expected payouts and loss aversion. The aspiration level and its associated probabilities of positive differences were not mentioned in the verbal report.

The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros; for Lottery B, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 Euros and 0 - (-2250) = 2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the positive difference (2250 Euros) occurs with the same probability in both lotteries (99.8% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B), but the negative difference for Lottery B is larger and occurs with a slightly lower probability, we can proceed to analyze the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, and if there's a loss, it shouldn't be too high.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and a 50% chance of a negative difference, while Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since the outcome equals the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their expected values (erwartete Auszahlung), indicating they looked at both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, indicating a preference for the certain gain over the potential for a higher but uncertain gain. The mention of ""der sichere Gewinn ist mehr wert"" (the certain gain is more valuable) suggests a risk-averse approach, prioritizing certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and expected values, not the aspiration level or differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would not directly lead to choosing Lottery B based on its calculation. The individual's justification, however, is based on expected value and the preference for a certain gain, not on the probability of outcomes being above an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on expected values and the certainty of the gain, not on the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it.

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -500 Euros, -1000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -1000 Euros, it's -500; for 0 Euros, it's 500; and for -500 Euros, it's 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the aspiration level and the outcomes, we can derive that Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference (when the outcome is 0 Euros) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (when the outcome is -1000 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their expected values (erwartete Auszahlung), comparing them to decide.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout and mentioned that a smaller loss is better than a chance at a high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on expected payouts and the preference for smaller losses over potential higher losses, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification is based on expected payouts and risk aversion (preferring a certain smaller loss to a chance of a larger loss). These justifications do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000, 2000, and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 and 0 Euros. However, to calculate the aspiration level as per the decision reason, we need to consider all unique outcomes from both lotteries, which are 6000, 2000, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level = (6000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 6000 Euros, the difference is 3333.33 Euros; for 2000 Euros, the difference is -666.67 Euros; and for 0 Euros, the difference is -2666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) is 25%, and for Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) is also 25%. However, considering the specific rule of the decision reason, we must calculate the probability of outcomes that yield a positive difference from the aspiration level for each lottery. For Lottery A, this includes only the 6000 Euro outcome. For Lottery B, it similarly includes only the 6000 Euro outcome. Given the specific outcomes and their probabilities, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) of the lotteries and then their probabilities (wkts), aiming to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout if the payouts are the same; they value a higher probability of winning over a higher win amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level, which does not directly align with the individual considering expected payouts and probabilities of winning. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout or, if payouts are equal, values a higher probability of winning. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the concept of an aspiration level or the preference for positive differences from such a level.

This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -4000, and -2000, which is (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000) / 4 = -3000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-3000) = -3000 and 0 - (-3000) = 3000; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-3000) = -1000, -2000 - (-3000) = 1000, and 0 - (-3000) = 3000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities are given, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, then chose the lottery with the higher expected payout. If the expected payouts are equal, the individual prefers the lottery with the lower loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout and, in case of a tie, the lower loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities but does not mention the aspiration level or the specific focus on positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual prefers the lottery with the higher expected payout or, in case of a tie, the lower loss. These rules do not directly align, as the individual's decision-making process is described in terms of expected value and loss aversion rather than aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The decision reason provided focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level, which does not align with the individual's described process of choosing based on expected payout and loss aversion. The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of an aspiration level or the specific rule about positive differences from it, suggesting that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (5 + 5000 + 0) / 3 = 1685 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5 - 1685 = -1680 Euros; for Lottery B, 5000 - 1685 = 3315 Euros and 0 - 1685 = -1685 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference (3315 Euros) and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference (-1685 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums of the outcomes and their probabilities (erst die summen, dann die wkts dazu), then chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (die lotterie die die höhere erwartete auszahlung hat). If the expected payouts were equal, the individual considered the chance of winning a large sum (da kein verlust und gewinn niedrig gehe ich für die chance auf die große summe).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on expected value and, in case of a tie, the potential for a large win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered expected payouts and the chance of a large win, which does not directly align with the aspiration level concept.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on expected value and the potential for a large win, which does not directly correspond to the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level. Instead, the focus was on expected payouts and the potential for a large win, suggesting a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
16,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is thus calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being higher than the aspiration level) and Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference but with a much smaller magnitude, we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, indicating they looked at both the potential gains/losses and their likelihoods. They also mention the expected payout and the risk associated with each lottery, specifically highlighting the significant risk of -5000 Euros in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the expected payout and the risk, specifically noting that while the expected payout might be the same, the risk of losing -5000 Euros is significantly worse than losing -5 Euros. This suggests the individual is considering the potential outcomes and their implications, but the focus is more on the risk aspect rather than the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences from it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual considers outcomes and their probabilities, there's no direct mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of outcomes being above this level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual, however, bases their decision on the expected payout and the risk associated with significant losses, not explicitly on the probability of outcomes being above a calculated aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the risk and expected payout rather than the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we first need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery A, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level (500 Euros) and the differences between the outcomes and this level. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first considers the sums (outcomes), then the weights (probabilities), and then chooses the lottery with the higher expected payout. The information considered by the individual includes the outcomes and their probabilities, which are used to calculate the expected payout. The individual’s justification for the choice is based on the expected payout, which is a calculation involving both the outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and this level) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities to calculate expected payout). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the differences between outcomes and such a level. Instead, the focus is on expected payout, which suggests a different decision criterion.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on the higher expected payout). The decision reason’s rule and the individual’s justification are based on different principles. The decision reason emphasizes the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level, while the individual’s justification is about maximizing expected value.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it to make the decision.

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual chose based on the higher expected payout. These are different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual. The focus on expected payout rather than the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level suggests a different decision-making criterion was applied."

The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67 and -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33; for Lottery A, 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities are given, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries. They aim to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers a certain gain over a chance of loss, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences from this level, considering the probabilities of positive differences. The individual, however, focuses on expected payouts and risk avoidance, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the specific calculation of differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which does not directly align with the individual’s stated preference for a certain gain over a chance of loss based on expected payouts.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (0 + 6000 + (-6000)) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 0 for Lottery A's outcome, 6000 for Lottery B's positive outcome, and -6000 for Lottery B's negative outcome. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference (its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level) and Lottery B has a 50% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (outcomes) and then the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, indicating they looked at both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout, stating it is better to have nothing than a chance of loss. This implies the individual prioritized avoiding loss over the potential for gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is about preferring a certain outcome (0 Euros) over a gamble that includes a chance of loss, which aligns more with risk aversion or loss aversion rather than directly with the decision reason’s rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's specific focus on aspiration levels and the probability of positive differences from this level. The verbal report suggests the individual made their decision based on expected payout and a preference for avoiding loss, which is distinct from the decision reason provided."
