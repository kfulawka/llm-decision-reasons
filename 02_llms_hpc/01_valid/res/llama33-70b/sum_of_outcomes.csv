0,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since we can derive the relevant information (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) from the given data, we can proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
Now, we compare the sums of the outcomes of Lottery A and Lottery B. Lottery A has a sum of 4900 Euros, and Lottery B has a sum of 2400 Euros. Since 4900 Euros is greater than 2400 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

1,"STEPS: 
To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, which can be calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. 
For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 2500 Euros + 0 Euros = 2500 Euros.
For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 2400 Euros + 0 Euros = 2400 Euros.
Since we can derive the relevant information (the sum of outcomes for each lottery), we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
Now, we compare the sums of outcomes for Lottery A and Lottery B to determine which one is higher.
Lottery A has a sum of outcomes of 2500 Euros.
Lottery B has a sum of outcomes of 2400 Euros.
Since 2500 Euros is greater than 2400 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
