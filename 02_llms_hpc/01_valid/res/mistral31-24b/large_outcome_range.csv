0,". The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason requires the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery to calculate the difference. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is 2400 Euros. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome for each lottery:

- Lottery A: 2500 Euros - 0 Euros = 2500 Euros
- Lottery B: 2400 Euros - 2400 Euros = 0 Euros

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference. Lottery A has a difference of 2500 Euros, while Lottery B has a difference of 0 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

1,"of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which can be derived from the given information.

Lottery A:
- Maximum outcome: 2500 Euros
- Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
- Difference: 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros

Lottery B:
- Maximum outcome: 2400 Euros
- Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
- Difference: 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome.
- Lottery A has a difference of 2500 Euros.
- Lottery B has a difference of 2400 Euros.

Since 2500 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 2400 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

19,"the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.**

The decision reason requires information about the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries:

- Lottery A:
  - Maximum outcome: 6000 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: -6000 Euros

- Lottery B:
  - Maximum outcome: 0 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros

The difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for Lottery A is 6000 - (-6000) = 12000 Euros.

The difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for Lottery B is 0 - 0 = 0 Euros.

Since we can derive the relevant information, we proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.
