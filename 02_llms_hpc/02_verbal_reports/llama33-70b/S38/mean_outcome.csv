STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2400 Euros since there's only one outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual seems to consider the similarity in gains (""kaum Unterschied bei den Gewinnen""), which might imply a comparison of the outcomes of the two lotteries but does not specify how the comparison was made. 
Second, the individual mentions ""sicheres Geld"" (safe money), which could imply a preference for the certain outcome of Lottery A over the uncertain outcomes of Lottery B. The justification for the choice is not explicitly linked to calculating mean outcomes or comparing them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (similarity in gains and the aspect of safe money), there's a discrepancy. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes explicitly. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) with the individual's justification (focusing on the similarity of gains and the certainty of one option), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus is more on the certainty and similarity of outcomes rather than the calculated mean.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions both lotteries (""Beide Lose"") and notes that the difference is not very high (""der Unterschied ist nicht so hoch""), implying they considered the outcomes of both lotteries and their differences.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not provide a clear justification for choosing one lottery over the other in terms of specific criteria like mean outcome or probability, but mentions the similarity or closeness of the two options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is derived from the lottery outcomes. The individual considered both lotteries and their differences but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring one lottery based on mean outcomes or any specific quantitative comparison that aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not provide evidence that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. The individual's focus on the difference between the lotteries and the lack of explicit mention of mean outcomes or a preference based on such calculations suggest that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, there is one outcome: 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes: 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the mean for Lottery A is 3000 Euros (since there's only one outcome), and for Lottery B, it's (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because 3000 Euros is greater than 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sicheres Geld und dies zu 100%,"" which translates to ""secure money and this at 100%."" This indicates the individual considered the certainty of the outcome, focusing on the 100% probability of an outcome in one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The emphasis on ""sicheres Geld"" (secure money) and ""zu 100%"" (at 100%) suggests the individual's justification is based on the certainty and security of the outcome rather than a calculation of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean of the outcomes, which involves considering all outcomes and their calculation. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of the outcome (100% probability).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the calculated mean of outcomes, whereas the individual's justification seems to prioritize the certainty of receiving money.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the specific decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries based on the provided verbal report. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome, not on calculating means.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""kein verlust"" (no loss), which could imply considering the outcomes of 0 Euros in both lotteries, and ""mehr Gewinn"" (more gain), suggesting a consideration of the potential gains. The phrase ""Unterschied nur 5%"" (difference only 5%) is ambiguous without clear context but may refer to a comparison between the two lotteries, possibly regarding their probabilities or outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice with the idea of no loss and more gain, and a small difference (5%) between the options, which might relate to the probabilities or the potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, potential for no loss, and more gain, along with a mention of a 5% difference): The individual does consider the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating a mean or comparing means between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (no loss, more gain, and a small difference): The individual's justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The mention of ""mehr Gewinn"" could vaguely align with preferring higher outcomes, but there's no clear indication of calculating or comparing means.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. While there's a consideration of outcomes and the desire for more gain, the specific process of calculating means and using that for the decision is not mentioned or implied clearly in the report. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but with some minor indications that could vaguely relate to aspects of the reason, preventing a complete certainty of non-use."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which is 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""beide Entscheidungen gewinnen"" which translates to ""both decisions win"" and ""man kann bis zu 90% gewinnen"" which translates to ""one can win up to 90%"". This suggests the individual considered the possibility of winning and the probability of winning (up to 90%) in their deliberation.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries but highlights the aspect of winning and a high probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (possibility of winning and probability of winning). The individual's focus seems to be on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of each lottery.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (winning and high probability of winning). The decision reason specifically considers the mean outcome, which does not directly align with the individual's emphasis on the probability of winning.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. The information relevant to this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the calculation of their mean, which can be derived from the given lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability (""wahrscheinlichkeit"") is very low (""so gering"") for both lotteries and implies that there's no loss (""kein Verlust"") involved, suggesting they considered the probabilities and the fact that there are no negative outcomes (losses) in either lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state a justification for choosing one lottery over the other based on the mean outcome or any other specific criterion. The focus is on the low probability and the absence of loss, without directly comparing the lotteries based on their outcomes or calculated means.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probabilities and the absence of losses, not on calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is not reflected in the individual's justification. The individual does not discuss mean outcomes or any calculation that would lead to preferring one lottery over the other based on the decision reason's criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the mean outcomes of the lotteries or used the decision reason's rule to make their choice. The focus on probabilities and the absence of loss does not align with the decision reason's criteria, suggesting that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the mean for Lottery B is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros since there's only one outcome. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -2000 Euros is higher than -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the higher loss with 80% probability in Lottery B but also mentions the chance to lose nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential loss against the possibility of no loss, indicating a consideration of both the probability and the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which doesn't directly match the individual's consideration of the probability of losing nothing versus the amount of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which doesn't align with the individual's justification that seems to consider the balance between the risk of loss and the chance of no loss, rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes or its rule for preference. The individual's consideration of probabilities and potential losses/no losses does not indicate the use of the mean outcome calculation as the basis for their decision."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-2000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Verlustchance geringer als in der anderen Lotterie,"" which translates to ""loss chance lower than in the other lottery."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing (or the chance of a negative outcome) in each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of losing in each lottery, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or considering the magnitude of the losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, while the individual considered the probability of losing. These are different focuses, with the decision reason ignoring probabilities and the individual ignoring the calculation of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on the lower chance of losing, not the mean outcome. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Verlustrisiko ist geringer"", which translates to ""Loss risk is lower"". This implies the individual considered the risk of loss associated with each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not explicitly state their justification, but the mention of ""loss risk"" suggests they were considering the potential for loss in their deliberation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly relate to the individual's consideration of ""loss risk"". 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual seems to prioritize the lottery with the lower loss risk. The decision reason does not directly address the concept of ""loss risk"" as described in the verbal report. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's deliberation process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""die Chance zu verlieren ist zwar höher"" which translates to ""the chance of losing is higher"" and ""aber der Betrag ist geringer"" which translates to ""but the amount is smaller"". This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of losing and the amounts to be lost in their deliberation. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to weigh the higher chance of losing against the smaller amount to be lost, without explicitly stating which aspect is more important.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing and amounts to be lost). The individual's considerations do not directly align with calculating the mean outcome as described by the decision reason, as they focus on the comparison of the chance of losing and the amount, rather than calculating a mean.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (weighing the higher chance of losing against the smaller amount to be lost). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes, which is the core of the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the comparative risks and amounts rather than on calculating mean outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used in the manner described.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
The verbal report is ""Kein Verlust also zocken,"" which translates to ""No loss, so gamble."" This suggests the individual considered the aspect of avoiding loss as a significant factor in their decision-making process. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the risk aspect, specifically the avoidance of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (avoidance of loss), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not align with the individual’s justification (avoiding loss), as the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries, not a clear preference based on loss avoidance.

The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by summing all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean outcome is -500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome of -500 Euros according to this reason. The information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""weniger Verlust"" (less loss) and ""andere Lotteriechance für den Verlust ist zu hoch mit 50%"" (the other lottery chance for loss is too high with 50%). This indicates the individual considered the potential losses and the probability of loss in one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be concerned about the high probability of loss in one of the lotteries, implying that the decision was influenced by the perceived risk or potential loss, rather than a direct comparison of mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of -500 Euros for both lotteries) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts and probability of loss): The individual's focus was on the probability of loss and the amount of loss rather than the mean outcome calculated by summing outcomes and dividing by their count.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (concern about the probability and amount of loss): The decision reason's rule does not align with the individual's justification, as the individual did not mention comparing mean outcomes or preferring based on such a calculation.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report ""%Wahrscheinlichkeit höher"" translates to ""higher probability"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes when making their decision. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing the sum of outcomes divided by the number of outcomes for each lottery. The individual's justification seems to focus on the probability aspect rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason specifically ignores probabilities and focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, it would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on the calculated means. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their counts.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is related to having ""at least a 50% chance of not losing anything."" This translates to focusing on the probability of not incurring a loss (0 Euros outcome) in the lotteries. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice, as described, emphasizes the aspect of not losing, which is tied to the presence of a 0 Euros outcome with a certain probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated from all outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of not losing), it's clear that the individual's focus was on the probability of avoiding loss rather than calculating mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the probability of not losing), there's a discrepancy. The decision reason is based on a calculation that doesn't consider probabilities, while the individual's justification is probability-based.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (2500 Euros) compared to Lottery B (5 Euros). The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is the probability of winning in Lottery A (0.01% or 0.1% as stated in the problem) compared to the certainty of winning in Lottery B (100%). 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the comparison of the certainty of winning a small amount in Lottery B versus the very low probability of winning a larger amount in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and number of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and certainty of winning), it appears there is a mismatch. The individual focuses on the probabilities and the certainty of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the probability and certainty of winning), it seems the individual did not use the mean outcome calculation as a basis for their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with a mean of -5 Euros, as it is higher than -2500 Euros of Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""Verlust zwar Gering in der anderen Lotterie"" which translates to ""loss indeed small in the other lottery"" and ""Chance zu verlieren auch relativ gering"" which translates to ""chance to lose also relatively small"". This indicates the individual considered the magnitude of potential losses and the probability of losing in their deliberation.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the relative smallness of the loss and the chance to lose, which suggests a consideration of both the outcomes and their probabilities, but does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires calculating the mean outcome of each lottery, which involves considering all outcomes. The individual's focus was on the magnitude of loss and the probability of losing, not explicitly on calculating means or comparing the sum of outcomes divided by the number of outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is based on a specific calculation. The individual's justification, as described, does not explicitly mention such a calculation or comparison of mean outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The verbal report does not indicate a calculation of mean outcomes or a preference based on such a calculation.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1500) / 1 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome (1500 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sichere 1500€"", which translates to ""secure 1500 Euros"". This indicates the individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide an explicit justification but implies a preference for the guaranteed amount, suggesting a focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the mean outcomes of both lotteries, but the individual's report does not mention such a calculation. Instead, it focuses on the security of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual also chooses Lottery A but seems to justify this choice based on the security of the outcome rather than the mean outcome calculation.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined (calculating and comparing mean outcomes) to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome rather than the mean of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the mean outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: The verbal report is ""Kein Verlust und sicheres Geld"", which translates to ""No loss and safe money"". This suggests that the individual considered the aspect of avoiding loss and the certainty of the outcome. The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the guaranteed nature of the outcome of one of the lotteries and the avoidance of potential loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (avoiding loss and certainty of the outcome), it appears that the individual's focus was more on the certainty and avoiding loss rather than directly comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing mean outcomes but does imply a preference for the certain outcome, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but for different stated reasons.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice might align with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the decision reason dictates. The individual's focus on avoiding loss and preferring a certain outcome suggests a different reasoning process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""1000€ sicher haben"" which translates to ""having 1000 Euros for sure,"" indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The phrase ""anstatt zu zocken"" translates to ""instead of gambling,"" suggesting the individual preferred the sure outcome over the gamble presented by Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, but the individual's consideration is about the certainty of the outcome and avoiding a gamble. There's a mismatch in the specific criteria used (mean outcome vs. certainty and risk avoidance).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but justified it based on the certainty of the outcome and the desire to avoid gambling, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of the outcome and the desire to avoid risk, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0. For Lottery A, the mean is 0 / 1 = 0. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 according to this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the risk or chance of losing in one of the lotteries, specifically mentioning ""zu hohe Chance zu verlieren"" which translates to ""too high a chance of losing."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of negative outcomes.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice, as described, emphasizes the concern over the risk of losing, suggesting that this was a key factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (chance of losing), there seems to be a discrepancy. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome, which does not account for the probability of winning or losing, whereas the individual's consideration is directly about the risk of loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (avoiding the high chance of losing), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on their mean outcomes.
