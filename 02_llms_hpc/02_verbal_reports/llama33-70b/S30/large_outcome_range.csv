STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2400 Euros (since it has a 100% probability of this outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, then looked at the expected payout. They also mentioned comparing the security of the options, specifically noting that having a 1% chance of getting nothing (in Lottery B) was a consideration.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the security of Lottery A over the potential higher payout of Lottery B, citing that the guaranteed 2400 Euros was better than the risk of getting only 0 Euros 1% of the time, despite the possibility of getting more (2500 Euros) 33% of the time.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, however, considered the expected payout and the security of the options, not explicitly mentioning the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a criterion for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. In contrast, the individual preferred Lottery A because of its guaranteed payout, indicating a preference for security over potential higher rewards, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the maximum and minimum values of each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums), which likely refers to the total potential winnings or outcomes, and ""wkts"" (which seems to be a typo or abbreviation, possibly referring to probabilities or weights). Then, they consider the expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"") of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by selecting the lottery with the higher expected payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration is centered around expected payouts, not directly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes. In contrast, the individual's justification is based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected payout, which does not directly relate to the rule of preferring based on the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report indicates that the individual's decision-making process was based on expected payouts, not on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums), ""wkts"" (which could imply probabilities or weights), and then choosing the lottery with the ""höhere erwartete auszahlung"" (higher expected payout). This suggests the individual considered the total outcomes and their probabilities to calculate expected values.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on the expected payout and mentions that a ""sicherer gewinn"" (certain gain) is better than a ""chance auf hohen gewinn"" (chance at a high gain), indicating a preference for certainty over risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (sums, probabilities, expected payouts), it appears the individual focused more on expected values rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the certain gain over a chance at a higher gain), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual seems to prioritize certainty and higher expected payouts, not the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on expected payouts and a preference for certainty, which does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, Lottery A is preferred because it has a larger difference (4000 Euros) between its minimum and maximum outcome compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums), which could refer to the total possible outcomes or expected values, and ""wkts"" (which likely refers to probabilities or weights), indicating they considered both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses the lottery with ""die höhere erwartete auszahlung"" (the higher expected payout). This implies the individual calculated and compared the expected values of the two lotteries to make their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, considered the expected payouts, which involve both the outcomes and their probabilities, not just the difference between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, while the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout. These are two distinct decision-making criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, focuses on expected payouts rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason provided, which prioritizes the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcome, was not used by the individual to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case is Lottery A with a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which can be derived from the given lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries. They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected payout, mentioning that a sure gain, even if not as high, is preferable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, whereas the individual considered the expected payouts, which involve both outcomes and probabilities. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, but the individual's justification is about choosing the lottery with the higher expected payout, indicating a focus on expected value rather than the range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on expected payouts and does not mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for their choice. This indicates that the decision reason provided, which specifically looks at the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, was not used by the individual to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries. They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout, considering the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the expected payout and the idea that, given the low chances of winning, they would opt for the higher potential gain if they were lucky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, considered the expected payouts and the concept of higher gain due to low probabilities, not explicitly the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification is about choosing the lottery with the higher expected payout or, in the context of low probabilities, the one with the potential for a higher gain, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but is based on a different rationale (expected value or potential high gain rather than the difference between outcomes).

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's focus was more on the expected payout and the concept of aiming for a higher gain due to the low probabilities of winning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities, abbreviated as ""wkts"") of the lotteries, then calculated the expected value (erwartungswert) of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected value, as indicated by ""erwartungswert links besser,"" which translates to ""expected value left is better,"" implying that Lottery A, listed on the left, has a higher expected value and was chosen for this reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities to calculate the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected value.
Based on these comparisons, it is clear that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes to make the decision. Instead, the decision was based on the expected value of each lottery.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros is not correct, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros for both lotteries and the maximum loss is -3000 Euros and -6000 Euros respectively, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros for Lottery B and 6000 Euros for Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities, abbreviated as ""wkts"") of the lotteries, then looked at the expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout. If there's a loss, they prefer the lower loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual considering the expected payout and preferring lower losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the expected payout and loss aversion, not the difference between outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on expected payout and loss aversion does not match the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering ""die summen"" (the sums), ""die wkts"" (which likely refers to probabilities or weights), and then taking the lottery with the ""höhere erwartete auszahlung"" (higher expected payout). The individual also mentions considering the loss, specifically not wanting it to be too high if there is a loss. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to be based on expected payout and the consideration of potential loss, indicating the individual is looking at both the potential gain and the potential loss in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (sums, probabilities, expected payout, and potential loss). The individual's considerations do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (based on expected payout and consideration of loss). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a preference based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes. The individual's focus was more on expected payout and minimizing potential loss rather than the specific rule of outcome differences.

The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the weights (probabilities) of the lotteries, then looked at the expected payouts. The individual also mentions comparing the lotteries based on the expected outcome and preferring a smaller loss over a chance of a higher loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the expected payout and the preference for a smaller certain loss over a gamble that could result in a higher loss, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences as a basis for their decision. Instead, the individual talks about expected payouts and risk aversion.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification suggests they preferred Lottery A because it offers a smaller certain loss, which does not align with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision. The decision reason focuses on the range of outcomes, while the individual's decision seems to be based on expected value and risk aversion.

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -2000 Euros (since it's the closest to a positive or zero outcome among the given options, but in the context of finding the maximum for the purpose of calculating the difference, we consider it as such) and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 2000 Euros for Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B due to its larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and then the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries. They aimed to choose the lottery with the higher expected payout, but if the expected payouts were equal or if there was no loss and the gain was low, they opted for the chance at the larger sum.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the expected payout and the potential for a large gain, even when the probabilities of such gains are low. They mention going for the chance at the large sum when there's no loss and the gain is low, which suggests they are attracted to the potential high reward despite its low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. While the individual does consider the outcomes, their primary focus as described is on expected payouts and the potential for a large sum, not explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads them to choose Lottery B, but based on the potential for a large sum rather than the difference between outcomes.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), their reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's focus is more on the expected payout and the allure of a large potential gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their verbal report does not directly mention or imply consideration of the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their choice. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's choice does align with what the decision reason would prefer, but the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's criteria."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome of -5 Euros, the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery A: Difference = 5000 Euros
- Lottery B: Difference = 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the sums (likely referring to expected values or outcomes) and the risks (""wkts"" could imply a consideration of probabilities or weights, but it's unclear). They also mention the expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"") and the risk of losing -5000 Euros in Lottery A compared to -5 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chooses based on the higher expected payout but acknowledges the risk of losing -5000 Euros as a significant factor, implying that risk plays a role in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, it seems the individual focused more on expected payouts and risk rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on expected payout and risk), there's a discrepancy. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason provided does not align with the individual's stated deliberation process. The individual's focus on expected payouts and risk assessment does not directly relate to the decision reason's emphasis on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 0 for Lottery A and 6000 for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (""wkts"" likely refers to probabilities or weights) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with considering sums and probabilities to calculate expected payouts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout. These are fundamentally different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on expected payouts rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, and it suggests that Lottery B has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcome than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the sums (which could refer to the expected values or the outcomes themselves) and the ""wkts"" (which likely refers to probabilities or weights), then choosing the lottery with the higher expected payout.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected auszahlung (payout), which implies a calculation of expected value rather than a comparison of the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual considered expected payouts, which does not directly relate to the differences between outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on expected payouts, not on the differences between the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome to make the decision. The individual's focus on expected payouts does not align with the decision reason's focus on the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same: 1000 Euros, so the difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, so the difference is 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sums (outcomes) and the probabilities (wkts) of the lotteries, then looked at the expected payouts.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the lottery with the higher expected payout, expressing a preference for a certain gain over a chance of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly match the individual's consideration of expected payouts and preference for certain gain over risk of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on expected payout and risk aversion, not the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on expected payout and preference for certain gain over risk of loss does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the sums (likely referring to the expected values or outcomes) and the probabilities (""wkts"" likely refers to weights or probabilities) before making a decision. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by preferring the lottery with the higher expected payout (""erwartete auszahlung"") and mentions that if it's equal, it's better to have nothing than a chance of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (sums/outcomes and probabilities, expected payout). The individual does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is key to the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the higher expected payout and avoiding loss). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritizes expected value and risk avoidance over the range of outcomes.
