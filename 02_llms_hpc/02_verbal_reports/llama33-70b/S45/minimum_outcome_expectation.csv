STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 1% probability, and for Lottery A, the minimum (and only) outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. Thus, the relevant information for Lottery B is 0 * 0.01 = 0, and for Lottery A, it is 2400 * 1 = 2400. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning (or not winning) with each lottery, noting that Lottery B offers a higher chance of winning compared to Lottery A, with only a 1% risk of getting 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the risk of not winning (0 Euros) was minimal (1%) and was considered acceptable compared to the guaranteed but lower potential win of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, seems to focus on the minimal risk and the comparative chances of winning, rather than explicitly calculating or considering the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which would be Lottery A (2400 * 1 = 2400) over Lottery B (0 * 0.01 = 0). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on the justification that the minimal risk was acceptable, not explicitly because of the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher product of minimum outcome and probability, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a different rationale, focusing on the minimal risk and comparative winning chances rather than the specific calculation of outcome-probability products. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 67%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros with a probability of 66%. The products are 0 * 0.67 = 0 for Lottery A and 0 * 0.66 = 0 for Lottery B. Since both products are 0, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion. However, to fully apply the reason, we should also consider the products of the maximum outcomes and their probabilities: 2500 * 0.33 for Lottery A and 2400 * 0.34 for Lottery B. This gives us 825 for Lottery A and 816 for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A based on the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability, but this aspect is not directly mentioned in the decision reason's description provided. The key information relevant to the decision reason as described (minimum outcome and its probability) leads to indifference, but considering the maximum outcomes and their probabilities (which seems to be a misinterpretation of the provided decision reason) would suggest a preference for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared both lotteries, noting their similar distributions. They focused on the probabilities of winning, which they approximated as being about 1/3 for both, with Lottery B being slightly more likely to win (by 1%). They also considered the difference in potential winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a slightly higher probability of winning (by 1%) and considered the difference in potential winnings to be small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason as described focuses on the products of the minimum outcome and its probability, which would lead to indifference. However, the individual's decision was based on the comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes and the difference in those outcomes, not directly on the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule, as it seems to have been intended to consider significant outcomes, would suggest a preference for Lottery A based on the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its slightly higher probability of winning and the small difference in potential winnings, not directly aligning with the decision reason as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability, leading to an assessment that the decision reason was not used by the individual. The individual's focus was on the probabilities of winning and the difference in potential winnings, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's criteria."
3,"B:
3000 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.

Verbal report:
Zwar wäre der Gewinn bei A höher gewesen mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit von 80% aber bei B gab es 100% einen hohen Gewinn. Dieser lag nur 1000 Euro unter A, aber dafür zu 100%

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by calculating the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 20%, resulting in a product of 0 * 0.2 = 0. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%, resulting in a product of 3000 * 1 = 3000. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a higher product (3000) compared to Lottery A (0).

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the higher potential gain of Lottery A with an 80% probability but also notes the certainty of a high gain in Lottery B, which is only 1000 Euros less than the potential gain of Lottery A but guaranteed at 100%. The individual's justification for the choice seems to weigh the trade-off between the potential higher gain of Lottery A and the certainty of a significant gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and their probabilities, certainty of gain), it appears the individual focuses more on the maximum potential gain and its probability rather than the minimum outcome and its probability as specified by the decision reason. However, the individual does consider the certainty (100% probability) of a high gain in Lottery B, which aligns with the aspect of probability in the decision reason but not directly with calculating the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating these products, does favor the certainty and high gain of Lottery B, suggesting some alignment with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B due to its guaranteed outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 80%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros with a probability of 75%. Since both lotteries have the same minimum outcome of 0 Euros, the product for both will be 0 (0 * probability = 0 for both). This means the decision reason, as described, does not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the minimum outcome and its probability because both products are 0. However, to fully apply the reason as it seems to be intended (focusing on the actual decision-making process described), we might interpret the reason as considering the overall value or the expected value of the lotteries, but strictly according to the given description, it's about the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain (Gewinn) of each lottery and the probabilities of winning. Specifically, they noted that Lottery A offers a higher gain but with a lower probability compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a 5% higher probability of winning compared to Lottery A, despite the lower potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. However, the individual's deliberation, as reported, focuses on the comparison of the potential gains and the probabilities of winning, not specifically on the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability, but since both products are 0, this reason does not apply directly as intended. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of probabilities and potential gains, not the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the potential gains and the probabilities of winning, rather than the product of the minimum outcome and its probability as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as described, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Verbal report:
Zu Beginn wieder alle Optionen verglichen. Bei A war zwar der Gewinn nur die Hälfte von B, dafür ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 90% attraktiver für mich als nur zu 45% wie in Beispiel B. Daher habe ich die risikoärmere Wahl getroffen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 10%, so the product is 0 * 0.10 = 0. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a probability of 55%, so the product is 0 * 0.55 = 0. Since both products are 0, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion alone. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared both options, noting that Lottery A's gain is only half of Lottery B's but has a more attractive probability of 90% compared to Lottery B's 45%. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""risikoärmere Wahl"" (less risky option), which suggests they were focusing on the probability aspect and the potential for loss (or no gain), implying a risk-averse approach.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, seems to focus more on the comparative probabilities of winning and the risk aspect rather than explicitly calculating or considering these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have a minimum outcome of 0 Euros, making their products equal. The individual, however, chose based on the perceived risk, preferring the higher probability of a positive outcome (even if smaller) over the lower probability of a larger outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its higher probability of winning and the perception of it being less risky, rather than explicitly considering the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities as the decision reason dictates. Since the decision reason leads to indifference due to both products being 0 and the individual's reasoning does not align with the specific calculation or preference rule of the decision reason, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"iko eingehen und die Lotterie wählen, die zwar eine geringere Wahrscheinlichkeit hat, aber den höheren Gewinn.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by considering the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the product is 0 * 99.9% + 6000 * 0.1% = 6. For Lottery B, the product is 0 * 99.8% + 3000 * 0.2% = 6. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these products.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the extremely low probabilities of winning in both lotteries (0.1% and 0.2%) and the potential winnings. The individual justifies the choice of Lottery A by stating that, given the low probabilities, they focused on the higher potential winnings of Lottery A (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros), even though the probability of winning is lower in Lottery A. The individual seems to prioritize the potential gain over the slight difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential winnings), it appears the individual did not directly calculate or compare the products as the decision reason suggests. Instead, the individual prioritized the higher potential gain in Lottery A due to the low probabilities of winning in both options. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (focusing on the higher potential winnings because the probabilities of winning are very low) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability). However, the decision reason's calculation yields equal products for both lotteries, which might not directly influence the individual's decision-making process as described. The individual's focus on the higher potential winnings given the low probabilities indirectly relates to the concept of maximizing potential gain but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's specific rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision to choose Lottery A can be understood in the context of seeking a higher potential gain, the specific decision reason provided (comparing products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities) does not seem to be directly applied in the individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report. The individual's reasoning is more aligned with a general preference for a higher potential reward given low probabilities, rather than a strict application of the provided decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a probability of 80%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 100%. Thus, the relevant information for Lottery A is -4000 * 0.8 = -3200, and for Lottery B, it is -3000 * 1 = -3000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, but since both products are negative, it actually prefers the one with the less negative product, which would be Lottery B in this context.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared both options and noted the difference in potential losses between Lottery A and Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 1000€ more loss in A if the loss occurs. They also considered the 20% chance of ending up with 0€ in Lottery A versus the 100% loss in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A despite the potential for a 1000€ greater loss because of the 20% chance of avoiding any loss with Lottery A, as opposed to the guaranteed loss with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual considered the potential losses and the probabilities of avoiding loss, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly mention calculating or comparing products of outcomes and probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B based on the less negative product of minimum outcome and probability (-3000 vs. -3200), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the chance to avoid loss, not directly on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason involves a specific calculation (product of the minimum outcome and its probability) that is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the potential to avoid loss with a 20% probability, rather than on the calculated products of outcomes and probabilities as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a probability of 20%, giving a product of -4000 * 0.20 = -800. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 25%, resulting in a product of -3000 * 0.25 = -750. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, which in this case would be Lottery B since -750 is greater than -800.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the gains and losses of both options and noted that both had high probabilities of loss (20% and 25%). They focused on the probability of loss and the amount of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it had a lower probability of loss (20% compared to 25% for Lottery B), despite acknowledging that the loss would be greater if it occurred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual considered the probabilities and the amounts of loss but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B (since -750 is greater than -800), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the lower probability of loss, not the product of the loss and its probability.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities. The individual's focus was on the probability of loss and the amount of potential loss, rather than the product of these two factors.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 90%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 45%. The products are -3000 * 0.9 = -2700 for Lottery A and -6000 * 0.45 = -2700 for Lottery B. Since these products can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes (10% chance of 0 Euros for Lottery A, 55% chance of 0 Euros for Lottery B), the potential losses (-3000 Euros for Lottery A, -6000 Euros for Lottery B), and the distribution of outcomes for both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the riskier option (Lottery B) because, despite the potential for a greater loss, the probability of avoiding loss (getting 0 Euros) was at least half, which was more favorable than the 10% chance of avoiding loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. While the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes, there's no direct mention of calculating or comparing these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. However, the individual's justification was based on the perceived risk and the probability of avoiding loss, not explicitly on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The focus was more on the risk perception and avoiding loss rather than calculating and comparing the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, or 0.001. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, or 0.002. The relevant information for Lottery A is -6000 * 0.001 = -6, and for Lottery B, it is -3000 * 0.002 = -6. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high negative outcome of -6000 Euros in Lottery A and its probability, as well as the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries for the negative outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the negative outcome in Lottery A (-6000 Euros) was a deterrent, despite acknowledging that the probability of getting -3000 Euros in Lottery B is higher than the probability of getting -6000 Euros in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. While the individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing these products.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. In this case, both lotteries have the same product (-6), but the individual's justification is based on the aversion to the higher negative outcome in Lottery A rather than a direct comparison of these products.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on the aversion to the higher negative outcome and the comparison of probabilities without mentioning the calculation of products suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a probability of 100%, so the product is 500 * 1 = 500. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%, so the product is 0 * 0.5 = 0. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in possible gains between Lotteries A and B (500 vs 1000 Euros) and the 50% risk associated with Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the difference in possible gains was not high enough to justify taking a 50% risk, preferring the certain 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities, which does not directly match the information considered by the individual (difference in gains and risk). 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of minimum outcome and probability, which would be Lottery A (500 * 1 = 500) over Lottery B (0 * 0.5 = 0). The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating these products, does prioritize the certainty of gaining 500 Euros over the risky option, aligning with preferring a higher guaranteed outcome but not explicitly following the decision reason's calculation.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability, so the product is -500 * 1 = -500. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with 50% probability, so the product is -1000 * 0.5 = -500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the products of the minimum outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money in both lotteries but focused on the possibility of not having a loss in Lottery B, indicating an awareness of the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing any money, despite acknowledging the high risk involved. The presence of a bonus (2000 Bonus) also influenced the decision to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, seems to focus more on the possibility of not losing money and the associated risk, rather than explicitly calculating or considering the products of outcomes and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. In this case, both lotteries have the same product (-500), which would suggest indifference according to the decision reason. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not mention comparing these products or preferring based on this rule; instead, it emphasizes the chance of avoiding loss and the influence of an external factor (the bonus).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on avoiding loss and the influence of external factors (like the bonus) rather than the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%, so the product is 0 * 0.5 = 0. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 75%, so the product is 0 * 0.75 = 0. Since both lotteries have a minimum outcome of 0 Euros, the products for both are 0, making this reason applicable but not directly decisive based on the calculation alone because both lotteries yield the same product.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the safety of the options (sicherere Variante), the number of possibilities to win (mehr Möglichkeiten zu Gewinnen), and the probability of winning nothing (Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 0% herauszugehen).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered more chances to win with a 50% probability compared to Lottery B, and although Lottery B had a higher potential win, it also had a higher probability of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual, however, discusses the number of chances to win and the higher probability of winning nothing in Lottery B, not directly mentioning the product of the minimum outcome and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. Since both lotteries have a product of 0, the reason does not directly apply in a manner that distinguishes between the two options based on the calculation. The individual’s justification, however, emphasizes the perceived safety and additional chances to win in Lottery A, which does not align with the specific calculation-based rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. The focus on safety, additional chances to win, and the comparison of probabilities of winning nothing does not align with the specific calculation and rule provided by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability, so the product is -6000 * 0.25 = -1500. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 25% probability, so the product is -4000 * 0.25 = -1000. Since we can derive these products from the given lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the chances of loss and the magnitude of the potential loss for both lotteries, noting that while the chance of loss in Lottery B is lower, the loss itself is much higher than in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by accepting a loss but wanting it to be as low as possible, specifically not as high as the potential loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (chances of loss and magnitude of potential losses), we see that the individual's considerations align with the components of the decision reason, though they do not explicitly calculate or mention the products.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of minimum outcome and its probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring a lower potential loss), we observe that the individual's preference for a lower loss (which would correspond to a ""higher"" product in the context of negative outcomes, as less negative is preferred) aligns with the rule of preferring the lottery with the ""higher"" product, given that both lotteries have negative minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's considerations and justifications closely align with the components and rule of the decision reason, though they do not explicitly state the calculation or comparison of products. The focus on minimizing the magnitude of potential loss, especially in the context of comparing the two lotteries, suggests a strong likelihood that the decision reason influenced their choice. However, the lack of explicit mention of calculating or comparing the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities introduces some uncertainty, preventing a full certainty assessment of 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability, so the product is 5 * 1 = 5. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, so the product is 0 * 0.999 = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, which in this case is Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B (99.9%) and the certainty of winning 5 Euros in Lottery A. They also mention the high potential gain in Lottery B but note its very low probability (0.1% or ""0,01"" as mentioned, which seems to be a typo and should be 0.1% or ""0,1"" in the context provided).
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because they prefer the certainty of 5 Euros over the high probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B, despite 5 Euros being a relatively small amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the outcomes and their probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason. However, the individual focuses more on the practical aspect of getting ""something"" (5 Euros) rather than ""nothing"" (0 Euros), which indirectly relates to the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring a certain, though small, gain over a high probability of no gain, which can be seen as aligning with preferring a non-zero outcome (5 Euros) over a zero outcome (0 Euros) when considering the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason in preferring the lottery that offers a certain, non-zero outcome (Lottery A) over one that has a high probability of resulting in no gain (Lottery B), which reflects the decision reason's preference for the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these products, which is why the assessment is not 100. The alignment in the practical choice and the underlying rationale for preferring a non-zero guaranteed outcome suggests a strong likelihood that the decision reason was influential, but the lack of explicit mention of the products or their comparison introduces some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a probability of 100%. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The products are:
- For Lottery A: -5000 * 0.001 = -5
- For Lottery B: -5 * 1 = -5
The decision reason can be applied since we can calculate these products.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B, the extremely low probability of a large loss in Lottery A, and the high potential loss amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the low probability of the large loss in Lottery A, the potential loss amount was too high, making the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B more acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss amounts and their probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. Since both lotteries have the same product (-5), the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification focuses on avoiding the high potential loss in Lottery A due to its magnitude, despite acknowledging its low probability, which indirectly aligns with considering the impact of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly apply the rule of comparing products.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's decision process involves considering the elements that the decision reason is based on (minimum outcomes and their probabilities), but the justification provided does not directly indicate the application of the specific rule of comparing the products of these elements to make the decision. The verbal report suggests an aversion to the high potential loss in Lottery A, which aligns with the spirit of considering outcomes and probabilities but does not clearly apply the decision reason as defined. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is -3000 * 0.5 = -1500. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 1500 * 1 = 1500. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains and losses of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A offers half the gain of Lottery B's potential gain but with a 100% probability, while Lottery B has a 50% chance of gain or loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the certain gain of Lottery A over the uncertain outcome of Lottery B, citing the security of the decision as the reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which involves calculating specific values for each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the general pros and cons without mentioning these specific calculations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which in this case would be Lottery A because its product (1500) is higher than Lottery B's product (-1500). The individual's justification is based on preferring the certain gain over the risk of loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not explicitly mention the calculation or comparison of products.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the specific decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities. While the individual's choice and justification align with what the decision reason would suggest, the process described does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment of the choice with the reason's outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is -3000 * 0.5 = -1500. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 2000 * 1 = 2000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential higher gain of Lottery A but also thought about a previous round where they likely lost money. They focused on the secure way of getting a 100% chance of winning, even though the gain was smaller than it could have been with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the secure option due to past losses and the certainty of winning, despite acknowledging the potential for a higher gain with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which involves calculations based on the worst-case scenarios of each lottery. The individual, however, seems to have been more influenced by the certainty of winning and past experiences rather than explicitly calculating or mentioning the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the desire for a secure win and the impact of past losses, not directly mentioning or implying the use of the specific rule about minimum outcome products.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities. The emphasis on security and past experiences suggests a different rationale for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is -3000 * 0.5 = -1500. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 1000 * 1 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, which in this case would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of Lottery B, mentioning that a 50% chance of gain or loss is too high, even though the potential gain is three times higher than in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by citing the high risk associated with Lottery B, implying that this risk outweighs the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which directly relates to the risk consideration mentioned by the individual. However, the individual's consideration is more qualitative, focusing on the perceived risk rather than calculating a specific product.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the minimum outcome and its probability, which aligns with the individual preferring Lottery A due to the lower risk. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating products or directly comparing these values between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment indicates that while there is some alignment between the decision reason and the individual's justification, particularly in the concern for risk, the individual's process as described does not directly match the calculation-based approach of the decision reason. The individual's focus on the qualitative aspect of risk rather than a quantitative comparison of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities introduces uncertainty about whether the decision reason was explicitly used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 50% probability, so the product is -6000 * 0.5 = -3000. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability, so the product is 0 * 1 = 0. Since the products can be calculated based on the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the possibility of a loss of -6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B, as well as the certainty of no gain or loss in Lottery A. 
Second, the individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning that the risk of losing -6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B was too high, implying that the absence of risk in Lottery A was the deciding factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss in Lottery B and no risk in Lottery A), it appears that the individual considered the concept of risk, which is related to but not directly the same as the decision reason's focus on the product of minimum outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher product of minimum outcome and probability) to the individual's justification (avoiding the risk of a significant loss), the individual's justification aligns with preferring a lottery that avoids a negative outcome, which is indirectly related to the decision reason but not explicitly based on calculating and comparing the products of minimum outcomes and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of comparing the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities. While the individual's focus on avoiding risk is somewhat related, it does not directly reflect the calculation-based approach of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual in the manner it is defined."
