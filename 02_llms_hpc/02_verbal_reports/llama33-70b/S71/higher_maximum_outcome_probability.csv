STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 33% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A being slightly higher, the 1% chance of winning nothing, and the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries. They also noted the 33% chance of an additional 100 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by explaining that the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A is compensated by other factors, leading them to choose Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual discussed various aspects, including the expected value and the specific probabilities of outcomes but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the maximum outcome but rather on a balance of factors including expected value and the compensation for the risk of winning nothing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The report discusses expected values, compensation for risks, and the presence of secure winnings but does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which can be derived from the given lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value and that both gains and probabilities are very similar. They also noted that the difference between the possible gains is not very high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it offers a slightly increased probability of winning, despite the difference in potential gains not being very high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual considering the probabilities and the fact that Lottery B has a slightly higher probability of its maximum outcome (though the individual does not explicitly state they compared the probabilities of the maximum outcomes directly).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual chose Lottery B because of its slightly higher winning probability, which indirectly suggests consideration of the probability of the maximum outcome, as the maximum outcomes are the ones with associated probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align with the decision reason in terms of preferring the lottery with a higher probability of winning (which, in this context, relates to the probability of the maximum outcome), even though the individual discusses expected values and similarities in gains and probabilities. The key factor in their decision was the slightly increased probability of winning offered by Lottery B, which is consistent with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B based on its higher winning probability. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's reasoning is not solely based on the probability of the maximum outcome but also considers other factors like expected value and the similarity in gains and probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros with 80% probability
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual mentions the expected value of both lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a slightly higher expected value than Lottery A.
- The individual also considers the certainty of the gain offered by Lottery A versus the chance of a higher gain with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain, whereas Lottery B only offers a chance at a slightly increased gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (expected values and the certainty of gain). The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the secure gain over the chance of a higher gain). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its 100% probability of the maximum outcome (3000 Euros), but the individual's reasoning is based on the security of the gain rather than the probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery A was based on the security of the gain it offers, not on the probability of the maximum outcome as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: 25% chance of 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 20% chance of 4000 Euros
Since Lottery A has a higher probability of its maximum outcome, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B to be slightly higher, the probability of winning in Lottery A to be somewhat higher, and the potential gain in Lottery B to be significantly higher, with similar probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B due to its higher potential gain, despite acknowledging the slightly higher probability of winning in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which the individual does mention but in the context of comparing the probabilities of winning in both lotteries, not solely focusing on the probability of the maximum outcome as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher potential gain, not because it had a higher probability of the maximum outcome.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as they prioritized the magnitude of the potential gain over the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 45% chance of winning 6000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 90% chance of winning 3000 Euros.
This information is relevant to the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value. They also consider the probability of winning in each lottery, mentioning that Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high win, while Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual decided on Lottery B because the chance of winning is significantly higher with B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual considering the chance of winning in each lottery. However, the individual also mentions the expected value, which is not part of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher chance of winning, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule, even though the individual does not explicitly state they are comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the higher chance of winning with Lottery B and their decision based on this criterion aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome. However, the mention of expected value and the framing of the choice in terms of ""chance of winning"" rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes introduces some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was the sole or primary basis for the choice. Therefore, while it is likely that the decision reason played a significant role, it is not certain that it was the only factor considered."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the maximum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers a chance at a twice-as-high gain as Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having a very low probability of winning, Lottery A offers a higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual focused on the potential gains and the low probabilities of winning but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (chose Lottery A for its higher potential gain despite the low probabilities), it appears the individual's decision was influenced by the potential gain rather than the probability of achieving the maximum outcome. The decision reason specifically looks at the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not the basis of the individual's stated justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision was based on the potential gain offered by each lottery and the low probabilities of winning, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 20%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which is 20% for Lottery A (since 0 Euros is the best outcome it offers) and 100% for Lottery B. However, it's crucial to note that the decision reason as stated seems to be focused on the probability of the ""maximum outcome,"" which in a typical context would refer to the best possible outcome. In this scenario, the best outcome for both lotteries (0 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros being the only outcome for Lottery B) is somewhat nuanced because both lotteries only offer negative or zero outcomes. The decision reason, as it stands, seems to prefer the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, which would technically be Lottery B since it has a 100% chance of its only outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A has a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B. They also considered the fact that Lottery B offers a certain loss, while Lottery A offers a moderate probability of no loss. Additionally, the individual noted that the magnitude of the losses in both lotteries is similar.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the similar magnitude of potential losses, Lottery A offers a good chance of not losing anything, which outweighed the consideration of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which, as interpreted, would favor Lottery B due to its 100% probability of the -3000 Euro outcome. However, the individual's consideration of the probability of no loss (which could be seen as the ""maximum"" outcome in this context, despite the decision reason's apparent focus on the literal maximum outcome) aligns more closely with the concept of preferring an outcome based on its probability, but the application differs.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the chance of avoiding any loss, which can be seen as related to but not directly aligned with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's reasoning is more about avoiding loss rather than strictly following the probability of the maximum outcome as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's choice was influenced by the desire to avoid loss and the presence of a moderate probability of no loss in Lottery A, rather than strictly adhering to the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome. While there's a conceptual similarity in considering probabilities, the application and focus differ, leading to a low assessment score."
8,"lust bei A niedriger und nur marginal wahrscheinlicher ist als bei B, habe ich mich für A entschieden.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros with a probability of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries. This information is: Lottery A has a 75% chance of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has an 80% chance of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the expected value of Lottery A to be slightly higher. They also noted that both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss, but the loss in Lottery A is lower and only marginally more probable than in Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its slightly higher expected value and the comparison of the losses and their probabilities, not directly on the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected value, comparison of losses and their probabilities), there is a mismatch. The decision reason focuses solely on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), whereas the individual's deliberation process focuses on expected value and the comparison of potential losses. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B due to its 80% chance of 0 Euros compared to Lottery A's 75%. However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule, as they chose Lottery A based on different criteria.

9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since the other outcome is a loss), which occurs with 10% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros, occurring with 55% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of not losing in each lottery, which is 10% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, both offer a high probability of loss, but the probability of loss is higher for Lottery A (90% loss probability) than for Lottery B (45% loss probability). The individual also considers the magnitude of potential losses, noting that while a loss in B is twice as high as in A, the difference in loss probabilities makes B more favorable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the potential loss being twice as high, the difference in probabilities of losing (or, implicitly, not losing) between the two lotteries makes B more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (not losing), which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the probabilities of losing and the implications of these probabilities. However, the individual’s focus is more on the loss probabilities and their implications rather than directly on the probability of the maximum outcome (not losing).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome (not losing), which in this case is Lottery B with 55% probability of not losing. The individual also chose Lottery B, but the justification provided in the verbal report emphasizes the comparison of loss probabilities and their implications rather than directly applying the rule of choosing based on the probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision process and justification share some similarities with the decision reason, particularly in considering the probabilities associated with the outcomes. However, the direct application of the decision reason (focusing on the probability of the maximum outcome) is not explicitly stated in the verbal report. The individual's focus on loss probabilities and their implications indirectly aligns with the decision reason but does not perfectly match its criteria. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not certain that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice, leading to an assessment that is somewhat above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher probability. In this case, the maximum outcome for both lotteries is the non-zero outcome (since the other outcome is 0 Euros for both). For Lottery A, the maximum outcome (-3000 Euros) has a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome (-6000 Euros) has a probability of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the possible loss in Lottery B is double that of Lottery A, and both losses have very low probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the loss is only half of the loss in Lottery B, considering that both losses have small probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's considerations do not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries. Instead, the individual focuses on the size of the loss and the fact that both have low probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification is based on the size of the loss, not the probability of the loss. The individual chose Lottery A because its loss is smaller, not because its probability of loss is higher.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's choice is justified by the size of the potential loss, not its probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A's maximum outcome and 100% for Lottery B's maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that both lotteries offer the same expected value and noted the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B. They also considered the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A and compared the possible gains, acknowledging they are of similar magnitude.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the secure gain it offers and the fact that Lottery A has a possibility of yielding nothing, despite the potential gains being of a similar order of magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual, however, discussed the secure gain of Lottery B, the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A, and the similar magnitude of possible gains but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual preferred the secure gain (Lottery B), which indirectly relates to the decision reason since a 100% probability (for 500 Euros) is higher than a 50% probability (for 1000 Euros), but the individual's justification was more about the security and the risk of getting nothing rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the outcome the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the decision was based on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason dictates. The individual's reasoning seems to focus more on the security of the gain and the risk of losing, which is related but not directly aligned with the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there's a slight alignment in the outcome chosen by the individual and what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not clearly demonstrate that the individual used the specific decision reason regarding the probability of the maximum outcome to make their decision. The individual's reasoning seems to be more influenced by the security of the gain and the avoidance of the risk of getting nothing, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome of 0 Euros with 50% probability.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, noting they are equal. They also considered the nature of the losses and the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a 50% chance of not losing anything, and they found the potential losses to be in a similar order of magnitude but decided the possibility of no loss was preferable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considered various aspects, including the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B, which aligns with the concept of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of these outcomes as the sole or primary reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B but frames it in terms of loss aversion and the similarity in the scale of potential losses rather than directly comparing the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process involves considerations that align with but are not limited to the decision reason provided. The individual does consider the aspect of achieving the maximum outcome (not losing anything) but frames their decision more broadly, including considerations of loss magnitude and the presence of a certain loss in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (considering the maximum outcome and its probability), it also includes other factors not directly related to the decision reason (such as the comparison of loss magnitudes and the certainty of loss in one option). The individual's justification does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule as the sole basis for the choice, indicating some but not complete alignment with the decision reason."
13,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 6000 Euros with 25% probability
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros with 25% probability
This information is sufficient for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, that Lottery A offers a chance at a high win, and that Lottery B offers a double chance at a similarly high or significantly lower win.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of winning with B is twice as high as with A, and the possible win amounts are in the same order of magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (expected values, chances of winning, and the magnitude of possible wins). The individual does consider the chances of winning but focuses more on the comparison of expected values and the magnitude of wins rather than specifically on the probability of the maximum outcome.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring Lottery B due to a double chance of winning and similar win amounts). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prioritize the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, which in this case is equally probable for both lotteries (25% for the maximum outcome in each), but the individual's focus is on the overall chance of winning any amount and the comparison of potential wins.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0, indicating that we are certain the decision reason was not used by the individual. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the overall chance of winning and the comparison of potential win amounts, rather than specifically on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason provided."

For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 50%. Since both lotteries have their maximum outcomes as 0 Euros, the decision reason can be applied by comparing the probabilities of these outcomes. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 75% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 50% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same. They also considered the probability of losses and the magnitude of potential losses in both lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery B over Lottery A because, despite the probability of a loss being higher in Lottery B, the magnitude of the losses in Lottery B is smaller compared to the maximum loss in Lottery A. The individual decided on Lottery B because the individual losses are absolutely smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), but the individual's consideration was more about the comparison of loss magnitudes and probabilities, not directly about the probability of the maximum outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the smaller magnitude of losses, not the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros).

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual's decision was influenced by the size of potential losses and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 5 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, but noted the difference in the probability of winning in each lottery, highlighting that a win in Lottery B is very unlikely, whereas Lottery A offers a small but certain win.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by focusing on the certainty of the win in Lottery A, given that only one round is relevant, and thus opted for the certain gain over the highly uncertain but potentially much larger gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual also mentioned the expected value, which is not directly relevant to the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (100% probability of the maximum outcome of 5 Euros) over Lottery B (0.1% probability of the maximum outcome of 5000 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it offers a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (certain win) aligns with preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome, even though the individual's reasoning also involved considerations of expected value and the context of a single round.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's reasoning touches on aspects beyond the decision reason (like expected value), the core of their justification (preferring the certain outcome) aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of its maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B: -5 Euros with 100% probability
Since the decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, and this information can be derived from the lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a small but certain loss, and Lottery A has a very low probability of a very high loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because the possible loss in Lottery A is much higher, and the loss in Lottery B is very small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason requires the comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (0 Euros for A with 99.9% probability and -5 Euros for B with 100% probability). The individual, however, focused on the expected value, the certainty of the loss in B, and the high potential loss in A, not directly on the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on the magnitude of the potential losses and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B, rather than the probability of the maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The focus was more on the expected value, the certainty of loss, and the magnitude of potential losses rather than the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain of Lottery A, the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B, and the equal chance of a significant loss with Lottery B. They also mentioned the expected value of Lottery B being lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by mentioning the secure gain it offers, the balanced risk and potential loss of Lottery B, and the lower expected value of Lottery B compared to A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a deciding factor. The individual discusses the security of the gain and the expected value, not directly the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual’s justification, however, is based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not directly on the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on security, expected value, and risk balance in the verbal report suggests that the decision was made based on different criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B offers a secure gain and has a much higher expected value compared to Lottery A. They also noted that Lottery A offers a chance at a slightly higher gain but comes with an equal chance of a significant loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its secure gain and higher expected value compared to Lottery A, considering the risk of a high loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor. Instead, the individual discusses the security of the gain, expected value, and risk of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, not directly on the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The report emphasizes the security of the gain and the comparison of expected values, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we proceed as follows:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries (1000€ for Lottery A and 0€ for Lottery B), the possibility of a higher gain with Lottery B, and the equal probability of losing 3000€ with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain of 1000€, implying that the certainty of the gain was a key factor in the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual did consider the outcomes and their associated probabilities (implicitly, by discussing the possibility of a higher gain and the risk of loss), but the focus was more on the expected values and the security of the gain rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the security of the gain with Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the probability of the maximum outcome (100% for Lottery A vs. 50% for Lottery B), but the individual does not explicitly state that the decision was based on comparing these probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision was influenced by the certainty of the gain offered by Lottery A, which aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher probability of its maximum outcome, but the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made by directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery B has a 50% probability of its maximum outcome (6000 Euros).
- Lottery A has a 100% probability of its maximum outcome (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a chance at a high gain but also a high loss, and Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. The individual also considered the high possible loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the high possible loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability, implying a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's consideration includes expected value, potential gains, and losses, not directly mentioning the probability of the maximum outcome as the primary factor.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding the high loss associated with Lottery B, not directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's decision seems to be more influenced by risk aversion and the potential for loss rather than the specific probability of achieving the maximum outcome.
