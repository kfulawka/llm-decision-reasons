sure outcome presence
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
   - Lottery A does not have a sure (100% probability) outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure (100% probability) outcome of 2400 Euros.
   - Relevant information: Lottery A has no sure outcome, and Lottery B has a sure outcome.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome of 2400 Euros, while Lottery A does not have any sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - The decision reason prefers lotteries with a sure outcome (an outcome with 100% probability).
   - Summarize the presence of sure outcomes in the lotteries:
     - Lottery A: No sure outcome; probabilities are 33% and 67%.
     - Lottery B: No sure outcome; probabilities are 34% and 66%.
   - Since neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome (with 100% probability), the relevant information cannot be derived.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. 
   - Lottery A does not have a sure outcome; it has an 80% chance to win 4000 Euros and a 20% chance to win 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome; it has a 100% chance to win 3000 Euros.
   The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A does not have a sure outcome, while Lottery B has a sure outcome.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reasonâ€™s rule:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome (100% probability of winning 3000 Euros).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess the information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason, which targets the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
   - Lottery A: Outcomes are 4000 Euros (20% probability) and 0 Euros (80% probability). There is no sure outcome.
   - Lottery B: Outcomes are 3000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability). There is no sure outcome.
   
   Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, relevant information for decision reason cannot be derived strictly.

2. Both lotteries lack the sure outcome.
   - Therefore, the decision reason cannot strictly be applied to prefer one lottery over the other based on the presence of a sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason is looking for a sure outcome in each lottery, which means an outcome that happens with 100% probability.
- Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability. There is no sure outcome here (probability of 100% for any outcome).
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability. There is no sure outcome here either (probability of 100% for any outcome).
- Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the relevant information regarding sure outcomes cannot be derived.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Because the relevant information about a sure outcome cannot be derived, the decision reason cannot differentiate between Lottery A and Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
- The decision reason requires identifying a sure outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A offers:
  - 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability
  - 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B offers:
  - 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability
  - 0 Euros with 99.8% probability
- Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome since in both lotteries, all outcomes have probabilities less than 100%. Therefore, the necessary information relevant to the decision reason (a sure outcome) cannot be derived from the given lotteries.

Step 2: Since the relevant information cannot be derived from the lotteries, the decision reason cannot prefer one lottery over another. Therefore, the final answer is:
FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess whether the decision reason can be applied to the given decision problem:
   - Lottery A offers outcomes of -4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability.
   - Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -3000 Euros with a 100% probability.
   - The decision reason specifies a preference for lotteries with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery A does not have a sure outcome (given probabilities are not 100% for any single outcome).
   - Lottery B does have a sure outcome (100% probability of -3000 Euros).

2. Summarize relevant information:
   - Lottery A: No sure outcome.
   - Lottery B: Sure outcome of -3000 Euros.

3. Apply the decision reason strictly:
   - According to the decision reason, the preferred lottery is the one with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery B is the only one with a sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.
- The decision reason is looking for a sure outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A outcomes: -4000 Euros (20% probability) and 0 Euros (80% probability). There is no sure outcome.
- Lottery B outcomes: -3000 Euros (25% probability) and 0 Euros (75% probability). There is no sure outcome.
- Since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the relevant information (presence of a sure outcome) cannot be derived.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
- Both lotteries lack a sure outcome, making it impossible for this decision reason to prefer one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly.
- The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A outcomes: -6000 Euros (45%), 0 Euros (55%).
- Lottery B outcomes: -3000 Euros (90%), 0 Euros (10%).

A sure outcome in the context of lotteries means an outcome that happens with 100% certainty.
- Lottery A does not have any outcome that occurs with 100% probability.
- Lottery B does not have any outcome that occurs with 100% probability.

Since neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome (an outcome that happens with 100% certainty), the decision reason cannot derive any preference based on the given rule.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Here, the decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
   - Sure outcome means an outcome that occurs with 100% probability.
   - Lottery A offers: -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B offers: -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with a 99.8% probability.
   - Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome (both have probabilities less than 100% for all outcomes).

   As neither lottery has a sure outcome (an outcome occurring with 100% probability), the decision reason cannot be strictly applied in this context. 

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - Lottery A offers the following outcomes: 1000 Euros with 50% probability, 0 Euros with 50% probability (there is no sure outcome)
   - Lottery B offers the following outcome: 500 Euros with 100% probability (this is a sure outcome)
   - Since the relevant information (presence of a sure outcome) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, proceed to the next step.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - According to the decision reason, a preference is given to a lottery with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome (500 Euros with 100% probability), while Lottery A does not have a sure outcome.
   - Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- A sure outcome is an outcome that happens with 100% probability.
- Lottery A has outcomes 6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability.
- Lottery B has outcomes 4000 Euros with 25% probability, 2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability.
- Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome (an outcome with 100% probability).

Therefore, the relevant information about the lotteries (presence of a sure outcome) for the decision reason cannot be derived.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT

"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess whether the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
- We need to evaluate if there is a sure outcome (a guaranteed result with 100% probability) in each lottery.
- Lottery A offers the following outcomes:
  - -6000 Euros with 25% probability
  - 0 Euros with 75% probability
  - There is no sure outcome in Lottery A.
- Lottery B offers the following outcomes:
  - -4000 Euros with 25% probability
  - -2000 Euros with 25% probability
  - 0 Euros with 50% probability
  - There is no sure outcome in Lottery B.
- Neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome.
- Since relevant information (presence of a sure outcome) cannot be derived from either lottery, the decision reason cannot be strictly applied.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
- As determined in Step 1, there is no sure outcome in either lottery.
- The reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, but since neither lottery has a sure outcome, the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Identify the structure of both lotteries:
   - Lottery A offers 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B offers 5 Euros with a 100% probability.
2. Determine the presence of a sure outcome:
   - Lottery A does not have a sure outcome since 5000 Euros is not guaranteed (0.1% probability).
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome since 5 Euros is guaranteed (100% probability).
3. Apply the decision reason:
   - The decision reason specifies a preference for the lottery with a sure outcome.
   - Since Lottery B has a sure outcome of 5 Euros with 100% probability, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess whether the decision reason ""considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery"" can be applied to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A:
     - Outcome 1: -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability
     - Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
     - There is no sure outcome in Lottery A.
   - Lottery B:
     - Outcome: -5 Euros with 100% probability
     - There is a sure outcome in Lottery B.

2. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a sure outcome, we compare the two lotteries:
   - Lottery A has no sure outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome (-5 Euros with 100% probability).
   - According to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has a sure outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 

1. The decision reason mentions it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
2. Lottery A does not offer any sure outcomes; it has a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros.
3. Lottery B offers a sure outcome of winning 1500 Euros with 100% probability.

Since Lottery B has a sure outcome, while Lottery A does not have any sure outcome:

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery.
   - Lottery A offers outcomes with 50% probability each, resulting in no sure outcome.
   - Lottery B offers 2000 Euros with 100% probability, resulting in a sure outcome.
   - Hence, sufficient information is available to apply the decision reason to the decision problem.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason's rule.
   - According to the reason, the preferred lottery is the one with a sure outcome.
   - Lottery B has a sure outcome (2000 Euros with 100% probability).
   - Lottery A does not have a sure outcome.
   - Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
