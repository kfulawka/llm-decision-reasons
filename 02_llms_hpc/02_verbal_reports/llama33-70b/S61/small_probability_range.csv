Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the 1% chance of losing (receiving 0 Euros) as practically irrelevant but acknowledges the significance of a 33% chance. They also mention the idea of ignoring a negligible risk to potentially increase their probable gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the negligible risk of losing against the potential for a higher gain, indicating that the small risk was worth taking for a possible increase in their probable winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the irrelevance of a 1% loss chance and the significance of a 33% chance, without directly mentioning the comparison of probability ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on the trade-off between risk and potential gain, not explicitly on the comparison of probability differences between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, their justification focuses on the perceived significance of specific probabilities and the trade-off between risk and potential gain. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."
2,".assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 34% - 0% = 34%, and for Lottery B, the difference is 33% - 0% = 33%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, and the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (33% vs 34%).

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but found it not entirely unrealistic. The individual focused on the question of whether the loss of 100€ in the prize money would be worth increasing the winning chance by one percentage point. Given the high risk of winning nothing, the individual prioritized mitigating this risk over having 100€ more in the winning case. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the trade-off between the potential gain and the increase in winning probability.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (the trade-off between potential gain and increased winning probability), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's focus on the increase in winning probability from one lottery to the other indirectly relates to the concept of probability differences. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, which is Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the value of increasing the winning chance, which aligns with preferring a lottery based on its probability characteristics but does not directly apply the decision reason's specific rule about the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision-making process involved considering the probabilities of the lotteries, the specific decision reason provided (preference based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) was not directly used in the individual's deliberation. The individual's focus was more on the trade-off between the potential gain and the increase in the winning probability, rather than the difference in probability ranges between the two lotteries."
3,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, so the difference is 60%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (0% vs 60%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which has a 20% probability, and compared it to the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros with Lottery A.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), which is Lottery A, because the risk associated with Lottery B, although small, was not negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss and certainty of gain): The individual focused on the risk and certainty aspects rather than explicitly discussing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing the safe option due to the risk associated with the other): The individual's justification is based on the presence of risk in one option and its absence in the other, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The decision reason specifically considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's verbal report. The individual's decision is based on the perceived risk and the certainty of the outcomes, not on the probability ranges or their differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 25% and the minimum is 0% (implied for the 0 Euros outcome, though not directly stated), giving a difference of 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 20% and the minimum is 0% (again, implied for the 0 Euros outcome), giving a difference of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison with another lottery scenario (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and emphasizes the importance of significantly increasing their chances of success over maximizing potential gain in a scenario where the outcome is unlikely but realistically possible.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by prioritizing the increase in success chances over the potential gain, especially in unlikely but possible scenarios.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the lotteries, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the importance of increasing success chances, which could relate to probability but does not explicitly address the difference in probability ranges between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery B (20% difference vs. 25% difference for Lottery A). However, the individual's justification emphasizes increasing success chances and does not directly relate to comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the verbal report does not discuss the specific rule of comparing probability differences between the lotteries.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 45% (for winning 6000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), but since the reason focuses on the difference within each lottery's probabilities, we look at the difference between the probabilities of the outcomes within each lottery. For Lottery A, this is |45% - 55%| = 10%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 10% (for winning 0 Euros), so the difference is |90% - 10%| = 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities within each lottery: 10% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as ""beinahe garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) and viewed 3000 Euros as a ""ziemlich hoher Gewinnwert"" (pretty high winnings). They also considered the 45% chance in Lottery A as risky.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) of Lottery B because they perceived it as less risky compared to the 45% chance of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery (10% for A and 80% for B), but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences. Instead, the individual focuses on the perceived guarantee and risk associated with the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery A with a 10% difference), but the individual chose Lottery B, citing its higher probability of winning as a reason for choosing the ""safe route."" The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as they did not explicitly consider the differences in probabilities within each lottery as the basis for their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries as practically negligible. They also mention the possibility of beating low probabilities and compare their ability to overcome a 0.2% chance with a 0.1% chance. Additionally, they consider the height of the prize money in case of a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the height of the prize money in case of a win, considering the low probabilities as practically negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B. The individual, however, focuses on the low probabilities being negligible and the prize money, not directly on the differences between the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference). The individual's justification, however, is based on the prize money, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference in probabilities, while the individual focuses on the prize money and the negligible nature of the winning probabilities, without directly addressing the difference in probabilities between the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 80% (for the -4000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which in this case would be Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses of both lotteries, focusing on minimizing the ""realistisch wahrscheinlichen Verlust"" (realistically probable loss). They noted that Lottery A has a chance to give no loss but considered the 20% probability of this happening as too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000 Euros compared to the certain loss in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the expected or likely loss, considering both the probabilities and the magnitude of the losses. They chose Lottery B because it offers a certain loss that is less than the potential loss in Lottery A, which, despite having a chance of no loss, has a high probability of a significantly larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, while the individual considered the overall probability of loss and its magnitude across both lotteries. The individual's consideration does not directly address the range of probabilities within each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to preferring Lottery B but is based on minimizing the realistically probable loss, not directly on the difference in probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process and the decision reason both lead to the same choice (Lottery B) but through different considerations. The individual's focus was on the probable loss and its minimization rather than the specific rule of comparing the ranges of probabilities within each lottery.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the potential losses, indicating that they weighed the risk of a larger loss against the reduction in probability of that loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential for a greater loss was not worth the reduction in probability of that loss, implying that the avoidance of larger losses was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor. The individual discusses probabilities and losses but does not directly compare the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 50% difference. The individual's justification, however, centers around the avoidance of larger losses and the subjective value of losses versus gains, not directly on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probability differences as the basis for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 10% (minimum) and 90% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% (minimum) and 55% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options and the attractive aspect of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%. They weighed the potential for a higher loss against the reduction in loss probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), avoiding the potential for a loss of 6000 Euros, implying they prioritized minimizing the risk of a high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities (80% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B), but the individual's considerations, as described, focus more on the absolute risk levels and the attractiveness of reducing the probability of loss, rather than the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery B with a 10% difference), but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding the higher potential loss and taking the ""safe route,"" not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's considerations and justification are centered around the risk of high losses and the attractiveness of reducing loss probabilities, rather than the specific rule of minimizing the difference in probability ranges within each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 0.998. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (or 0.998), resulting in a difference of 0.996. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery B because 0.996 < 0.998.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 0.1% and 0.2% are approximately equally irrelevant in a single trial, suggesting they consider the probabilities of the losses in both lotteries to be practically negligible. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's goal was to minimize the penalty amount in a theoretical unfortunate case, implying they focused on minimizing the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. In contrast, the individual seems to focus on the practical irrelevance of the probabilities and the goal of minimizing the loss amount, not directly on the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, which would lead to choosing Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is about minimizing the loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it has a smaller loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros), but this is not directly related to the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the differences in probability ranges. The individual's focus is more on the practical implications of the losses rather than the probability differences. However, the outcome of their decision (potentially choosing Lottery B to minimize loss) coincidentally aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery B due to its smaller probability difference), but for different reasons.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice might coincide with what the decision reason would prefer, the verbal report indicates that the decision was made based on different considerations (minimizing loss amount due to the perceived irrelevance of the probabilities) rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B because it has the smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that both options were mathematically equal in value but emphasizes the importance of ensuring an increase in winnings over maximizing the potential for further gain. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of gain versus the potential for a higher reward.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification focuses on the value of ensuring a certain increase in winnings (""sicherzustellen dass mein Gewinn sich überhaupt mehrt"") rather than pursuing the potential for a higher, but uncertain, gain. This implies a preference for certainty over potential higher rewards.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of mathematical equality and the desire for a certain increase in winnings.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. While the decision reason prefers Lottery B due to its smaller difference in probability (0%), the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B (if chosen) seems to be based on the certainty of the gain it offers, not explicitly on the probability differences within each lottery.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus is on the certainty of gain and the mathematical equality of the options, rather than the specific probability differences within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as defined, was used by the individual. The individual's justification and consideration process, as described in the verbal report, do not directly align with the criteria outlined in the decision reason, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well since there's only one outcome. However, interpreting the rule strictly, both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the context implies comparing variability in outcomes. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis"" (relevant chance of an outcome), indicating they considered the probabilities. They also talk about minimizing the ""absoluten möglichen Verlustwert"" (absolute possible loss value), showing they considered the monetary outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to minimize the absolute possible loss value, implying they chose based on the potential loss amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration of ""relevante Chance"" might imply a focus on the presence of a chance rather than the difference between probabilities. The individual's main focus, however, was on minimizing loss, which does not directly align with comparing probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason does not directly apply as intended. The individual's justification, minimizing the absolute possible loss, does not directly follow the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference is 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the minimum is 25% and the maximum is 50%, making the difference 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the amounts of money (noting all were four-digit, thus significant) and the probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual based their decision on which option gave them the greater probability of winning a large amount, without directly comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probability of winning a large amount, not the difference between probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, while the individual preferred the option with the greater probability of winning a large amount. These are not directly comparable, as the individual's justification does not address the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Instead, the focus was on the probability of winning a significant amount, which aligns with a different decision-making criterion. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and prioritized minimizing the chance of losing. They preferred a 25 percentage point higher chance of not losing over reducing the loss amount in the unlikely event of a loss. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on minimizing the risk of loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (the risk of losses and the chance of not losing), we see that the individual's consideration of the chance of not losing aligns with the decision reason's focus on probability differences, as a higher chance of not losing (0 Euros) is associated with a smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities in Lottery A. The individual's justification for the choice (minimizing the risk of loss) is consistent with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability), as the smaller difference in Lottery A is due to the higher probability of not losing. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention the calculation or consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which introduces some uncertainty.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 99.8% (or 0.998). For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery A: Difference = 99.8% (or 0.998)
- Lottery B: Difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the low probability (0.1%) of winning in Lottery A and seems to consider the guaranteed small win in Lottery B as more appealing. They also mention that the low probability of the high reward in Lottery A is ""realistisch irrelevant,"" implying it's practically irrelevant due to its low likelihood.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers a guaranteed small win over the ""illusion"" of a jackpot, indicating a preference for certainty over a highly uncertain but potentially higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual does consider the practical implications of the low probability in Lottery A, which could be indirectly related to the concept of probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on preferring a guaranteed small win over a highly uncertain large win, not explicitly on the differences in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The final assessment is 20, indicating that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for the decision. The individual's reasoning seems more focused on the practical appeal of a guaranteed win versus the low probability of a significant win. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice, although there might be some indirect relation in considering the certainty of outcomes."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A, found it unattractive, but then looked at the probability distribution. They considered the 0.1% chance of losing a significant amount to be negligible and the chance of losing 0 Euros to be practically guaranteed. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by considering the risk of the significant loss to be negligible due to its low probability, thus making the effective outcome of Lottery A more attractive.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process. The individual focused more on the perceived risk and its practical implications rather than the numerical difference between probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). However, the individual chose Lottery A, justifying it based on the perceived negligible risk of the significant loss, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual based their decision on the perceived risk and its practical implications rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, and it is summarized as: both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical aspects, specifically the expected value (Mittelwert) of each lottery. They calculated that Lottery A would have an expected value of 0€ over many attempts, while Lottery B offered a guaranteed 1500€. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the expected values of the two lotteries and the guarantee provided by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the expected values and the guarantee of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. However, since both lotteries have the same probability difference of 0%, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. In contrast, the individual's justification was based on the expected values and the guarantee, not on the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, to apply the reason correctly, we interpret it as considering the range of probabilities for each lottery. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing a lottery with outcomes of 3000/-3000 Euros and probabilities of 50/50 to a guaranteed option, but incorrectly states the guaranteed amount as 1500 Euros instead of 2000 Euros. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds the secure option more attractive, implying a preference for certainty over risk. The decision is described as ""selfverständlich"" (obvious), suggesting the individual did not deeply consider complex decision rules.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities for each lottery. The individual's report does not explicitly mention comparing these probability ranges.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%) when considering the provided interpretation, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual prefers the certain option (Lottery A) due to its attractiveness, not explicitly because of the probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason based on the probability differences to make the decision. The preference for the certain option (Lottery A) seems to be based on its guaranteed nature rather than the specific decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for both lotteries, which are both 0%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a ""garantierter Gewinn"" (guaranteed win) of 1000 Euros and compares it to the ""Mittelwert von Option A"" (mean value of Option A), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and the expected value of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros, although significantly less than the potential win of Lottery A, is still more than the mean value of Lottery A. This implies the individual is considering the certainty of the outcome and its comparison to the expected value of the other option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability differences) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win and expected values). The individual does not mention considering the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on guaranteed win versus expected value). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there is no discussion about the probability ranges or their differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probability differences between the lotteries, nor does their justification align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the smaller difference. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability distributions of the lotteries, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B and noted that one of the outcomes was a theoretical loss of 6000 Euros, which led to the exclusion of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification was based on the presence of a potential significant loss in Lottery B, making the probabilities irrelevant after recognizing this risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the risk of a significant loss rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, but the individual's choice was based on avoiding a significant potential loss, not on comparing probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's decision was driven by the risk of a significant loss rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason.
