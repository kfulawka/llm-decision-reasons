small probability overweighting
"STEPS:
1. ***Assess the relevant information for the decision reason:***
   - Lottery A:
     - 2500 Euros with 33% probability
     - 2400 Euros with 66% probability
     - 0 Euros with 1% probability
   - Lottery B:
     - 2400 Euros with 100% probability 
   - Identify the small probability outcomes:
     - In Lottery A, the 2500 Euros has a probability of 33% and the 0 Euros has a probability of 1%. The 1% probability is below 20% and needs adjustment.
     - In Lottery B, there are no small probability outcomes since 2400 Euros is with 100% probability.

2. ***Adjust the weights according to the reason's rule:***
   - Adjust the 1% probability in Lottery A by increasing it by 10 percentage points:
     - 0 Euros, adjusted probability: 1% + 10% = 11%
   - Probabilities need to sum to 100%, which means:
     - New effective probabilities for Lottery A: 
       - 2500 Euros: 33%
       - 2400 Euros: 66% - 10% (for the adjustment on 0 Euros outcome) = 56%
       - 0 Euros: adjusted to 11%

3. ***Calculate the weighted sum of each lottery:***
   - Lottery A:
     - Weighted sum = (2500 Euros * 33%) + (2400 Euros * 56%) + (0 Euros * 11%)
     - Weighted sum = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.56) + (0)
     - Weighted sum = 825 + 1344 + 0
     - Weighted sum = 2169 Euros
   - Lottery B:
     - Weighted sum = 2400 Euros * 100%
     - Weighted sum = 2400 Euros * 1
     - Weighted sum = 2400 Euros

4. ***Compare the weighted sums:***
   - Lottery A weighted sum: 2169 Euros
   - Lottery B weighted sum: 2400 Euros

5. ***Determine the preferred lottery by the decision reason:***
   - Since 2400 Euros (Lottery B) > 2169 Euros (Lottery A), Lottery B, with the higher weighted sum, is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The decision reason involves evaluating outcomes with small probabilities and adjusting their probabilities accordingly.
   - Small probabilities are defined as those less than 20%.
   - Lottery A has outcomes: 
     - 2500 Euros with 33% probability 
     - 0 Euros with 67% probability
   - Lottery B has outcomes: 
     - 2400 Euros with 34% probability
     - 0 Euros with 66% probability
   - Both lotteries do not have any outcomes with a probability less than 20%. Therefore, no probabilities will be adjusted.
   - Relevant information: original probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - Since there are no small probabilities to adjust in either Lottery A or Lottery B, the decision reason cannot change the outcome probabilities for either lottery.
   - As the probabilities remain unchanged:
     - For Lottery A: 2500 Euros with 33%, 0 Euros with 67%
     - For Lottery B: 2400 Euros with 34%, 0 Euros with 66%
   - The decision reason results in evaluating lotteries based on their original probabilities, leading to no change in preference.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - The provided decision reason requires us to identify and adjust probabilities that are less than 20%.
   - In Lottery A: 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability.
     - Both probabilities {80%, 20%} do not qualify as ""less than 20%"", so no adjustment is made.
   - In Lottery B: 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
     - The probability {100%} does not qualify as ""less than 20%"", so no adjustment is made.
   - Since there are no probabilities less than 20% in either lottery, the relevant information for this decision reason is the same as the original lotteries:
     - Lottery A: 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability.
     - Lottery B: 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
   - So, proceed to Step 2.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A's expected value (given no adjustments): 
     = (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%)
     = 3200 Euros.
   - Lottery B's expected value (given no adjustments):
     = 3000 Euros * 100%
     = 3000 Euros.
   - Comparing the expected values of the two lotteries:
     - Lottery A: 3200 Euros
     - Lottery B: 3000 Euros
     - Since the decision reason directs us to sum the weighted probabilities, and there are no probabilities less than 20%, the expected values alone suffice here.

- Lottery A with 3200 Euros is more favorable than Lottery B with 3000 Euros based on the sum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner:**
   - We need to identify outcomes with probabilities less than 20% in each lottery and adjust their weights as per the decision reason.
   - For Lottery A: 
     - 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, so it already meets the threshold and does not get weighted differently.
     - 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, so it is not adjusted either.
   - For Lottery B:
     - 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is above 20% and remains unchanged.
     - 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, so it is not adjusted either.
   - Relevant information: Weights for lotteries are not adjusted because all probabilities are above or equal to 20%.

2. **Apply the decision reason by comparing the weighted sums:**
   - Lottery A: 
     \( 4000 \times 20\% + 0 \times 80\% = 4000 \times 0.2 = 800 \)
   - Lottery B:
     \( 3000 \times 25\% + 0 \times 75\% = 3000 \times 0.25 = 750 \)
   - According to the reason, the sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities is 800 Euros for Lottery A and 750 Euros for Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Identify the small probability outcomes in both lotteries:
   - For Lottery A: 6000 Euros has a 45% probability (not less than 20%)
   - For Lottery A: 0 Euros has a 55% probability (not less than 20%)
   - For Lottery B: 3000 Euros has a 90% probability (not less than 20%)
   - For Lottery B: 0 Euros has a 10% probability (less than 20%)

2. Apply the weight modification on the probabilities:
   - For Lottery A, no probabilities are less than 20%, so probabilities remain unchanged:
     - Weighted probability of 6000 Euros: 45%
     - Weighted probability of 0 Euros: 55%
   - For Lottery B, the probability of 0 Euros is less than 20%, so it increases by 10 percentage points:
     - Weighted probability of 3000 Euros: 90%
     - Weighted probability of 0 Euros: 10% + 10% = 20% (Total probability sum = 110%, need renormalization)

3. Normalize Lottery B probabilities to sum to 100%:
   - Sum of probabilities: 90% + 20% = 110%
   - Normalization factor: 100% / 110% = 100/110 = 0.909
   - Normalize weighted probability of 3000 Euros: 90% * 0.909 = 81.81%
   - Normalize weighted probability of 0 Euros: 20% * 0.909 = 18.18%

4. Calculate the expected outcomes using weighted probabilities:
   - Lottery A: (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros
   - Lottery B: (3000 Euros * 0.8181) + (0 Euros * 0.1818) = 3000 * 0.8181 = 2454.3 Euros

5. Compare the expected outcomes:
   - Expected outcome of Lottery A: 2700 Euros
   - Expected outcome of Lottery B: 2454.3 Euros

6. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. First, I assess if the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason involves adjusting probabilities of outcomes that are less than 20% by increasing them by 10 percentage points. Both lotteries have outcomes with probabilities below 20%, so this information can be derived and applied. 

   Lottery A:
   - 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability
   - Adjustment: 0.1% + 10% = 10.1%
   - 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
   - Adjustment: Not applicable (probability is not less than 20%)

   Lottery B:
   - 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability
   - Adjustment: 0.2% + 10% = 10.2%
   - 0 Euros with 99.8% probability
   - Adjustment: Not applicable (probability is not less than 20%)

2. Apply the decision reason's rule by calculating the weighted sum of outcomes:
   
   Adjusted expected value for Lottery A:
   - 6000 Euros * 10.1% = 6000 * 0.101 = 606 Euros
   - 0 Euros * 99.9% = 0
   - Total: 606 Euros

   Adjusted expected value for Lottery B:
   - 3000 Euros * 10.2% = 3000 * 0.102 = 306 Euros
   - 0 Euros * 99.8% = 0
   - Total: 306 Euros

3. Compare the adjusted expected values of both lotteries:
   - Lottery A: 606 Euros
   - Lottery B: 306 Euros

   Since the adjusted expected value of Lottery A (606 Euros) is greater than that of Lottery B (306 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A outcomes and probabilities:
     - -4000 Euros with 80% probability
     - 0 Euros with 20% probability
   - Lottery B outcomes and probabilities:
     - -3000 Euros with 100% probability
   - Note: The decision reason states that outcomes with a probability of less than 20% should have their probability increased by 10 percentage points. Since all probabilities here are 20% or greater, this rule does not change any probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A:
     - Weighted outcome for -4000 Euros: -4000 * 0.80 = -3200 Euros
     - Weighted outcome for 0 Euros: 0 * 0.20 = 0 Euros
     - Total weighted sum for Lottery A: -3200 Euros
   - Lottery B:
     - Weighted outcome for -3000 Euros: -3000 * 1.00 = -3000 Euros
     - Total weighted sum for Lottery B: -3000 Euros
   - Comparing the total weighted sums:
     - Lottery A: -3200 Euros
     - Lottery B: -3000 Euros
     - Lottery B has a more favorable (less negative) sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Lottery A outcomes and probabilities:
     - -4000 Euros with a probability of 20%
     - 0 Euros with a probability of 80%

   - Lottery B outcomes and probabilities:
     - -3000 Euros with a probability of 25%
     - 0 Euros with a probability of 75%
   
   - The decision reason specifies considering small probability outcomes with less than 20% and adjusting weight.
   - In Lottery A, there are no outcomes with a probability of less than 20%.
   - In Lottery B, there are no outcomes with a probability of less than 20%.
   
   The relevant information can be derived: 
   - For both lotteries, no outcomes will have their probabilities adjusted since all probabilities are equal to or above 20%.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
   - Since no small probability outcomes are adjusted in weight, we use the original probabilities.
   - Calculate the expected value for both lotteries with their original probabilities:
     - Lottery A: (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800
     - Lottery B: (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750

   - The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable (higher) expected value sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
     - Expected value for Lottery A: -800
     - Expected value for Lottery B: -750 
   
   - Therefore, Lottery B is preferred as -750 is more favorable than -800.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. **Assess applicability of decision reason:**
    - Evaluate if either lottery has outcomes with a probability less than 20%.
    - Lottery A: Outcomes are -6000 Euros with 45% and 0 Euros with 55%. Neither probability is less than 20%.
    - Lottery B: Outcomes are -3000 Euros with 90% and 0 Euros with 10%. The 10% probability is less than 20%.

2. **Summarize relevant information:**
    - Lottery A: No outcomes have probability less than 20%. Probabilities remain as -6000 Euros with 45% and 0 Euros with 55%.
    - Lottery B: The outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is increased by 10 percentage points to 20%. Adjusted probabilities will be:
        - -3000 Euros with 90% remains unchanged.
        - 0 Euros with 10% + 10% = 20%.

3. **Calculate weight-adjusted expected outcomes:**
    - Lottery A:
        - \((-6000 \text{ Euros} \times 0.45) + (0 \text{ Euros} \times 0.55) = -2700 \text{ Euros}\)
    - Lottery B:
        - Combined perspective (weighing the sum instead of expectations because the decision reason gives us utility perspective): (90% of -3000 Euros and 20% of 0 Euros needs proper weighing)
	    - Instead: Common-sum attempt: -3000 \( \times 0.90 \approx -2400 \) then worthwhile simplistic expectation within \( -2400 within better probability sum (accounting the proper aspect) )

4. **Apply decision reason:**
    - Lottery A: Expected value = -2700 Euros.
    - Lottery B: Expected value corrected -> -2600 Euros (focused lower EPS less negative impact).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the decision reason applicability:
   - The decision reason focuses on outcomes with small probabilities (less than 20% probability).
   - Lottery A has two outcomes: -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B has two outcomes: -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with 99.8% probability.
   Since both lotteries have small probability outcomes (less than 20%), we can apply the decision reason.

2. Summarize the relevant information for each lottery:
   - Lottery A: 
     - Weighted probability of -6000 Euros is 10.1% (0.1% actual probability + 10% increment).
     - Weighted probability of 0 Euros remains 99.9%.
   - Lottery B: 
     - Weighted probability of -3000 Euros is 10.2% (0.2% actual probability + 10% increment).
     - Weighted probability of 0 Euros remains 99.8%.

3. Calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery:
   - Lottery A:
     - Weighted sum = (-6000 Euros * 0.101) + (0 Euros * 0.999) = -606 Euros.
   - Lottery B:
     - Weighted sum = (-3000 Euros * 0.102) + (0 Euros * 0.998) = -306 Euros.

4. Compare the weighted sums:
   - Lottery A has a weighted sum of -606 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a weighted sum of -306 Euros.
   - Since the reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable (less negative) weighted sum of outcomes, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - Lottery A outcomes: 1000 Euros (50% probability) and 0 Euros (50% probability)
   - Lottery B outcomes: 500 Euros (100% probability)
   - Check for outcomes with a probability of less than 20%:
     - For Lottery A: No outcome has a probability less than 20%.
     - For Lottery B: No outcome has a probability less than 20%.
   - Since there are no outcomes with a probability of less than 20%, the given decision reason cannot be applied in a strict manner. 

2. As the decision reason cannot be strictly applied (no probabilities below 20% to adjust), we must consider the decision reason's requirement for adjusted weighting:
   - There are no such adjustments possible under the given probabilities.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - We need to determine if any outcomes have a probability of less than 20% in each lottery. 
   - In Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% for both outcomes.
   - In Lottery B, the probability is 100% for the outcome.
   - Since there are no outcomes with a probability of less than 20%, no adjustments to the probabilities are necessary based on the given reason.

2. Since the adjustment is not necessary, the original probabilities and outcomes will be considered.
   - For Lottery A, the expected monetary outcome is:
     (0.5 * -1000) + (0.5 * 0) = -500
   - For Lottery B, the expected monetary outcome is:
     (1 * -500) = -500
   - The expected values for both lotteries are the same.

3. Apply the decision reason to determine the preferred lottery.
   - Because both lotteries have the same expected monetary outcome when considered with their original probabilities, the decision reason implies indifference.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"```
STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - Identify outcomes with less than 20% probability and adjust their weights.

    Lottery A:
    - 6000 Euros with 25% probability
    - 0 Euros with 75% probability

    Lottery B:
    - 4000 Euros with 25% probability
    - 2000 Euros with 25% probability
    - 0 Euros with 50% probability

    In this case, there are no outcomes in either lottery with a probability less than 20%. 
    So no weight adjustments are required and we can proceed with the given probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason's rule.
   - Calculate the expected value of each lottery by summing the outcomes weighted by their probabilities.

    For Lottery A:
    - Expected value = (6000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 75%)
                     = 1500 Euros + 0 Euros
                     = 1500 Euros

    For Lottery B:
    - Expected value = (4000 Euros * 25%) + (2000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 50%)
                     = 1000 Euros + 500 Euros + 0 Euros
                     = 1500 Euros

Since both lotteries have an equal expected value of 1500 Euros, the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.

"STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied:**
   - In order to apply the decision reason, it is necessary to compute and compare the weighted probabilities based on the given rule. 
   - The reason considers outcomes with a probability of less than 20% and increases their weight by 10 percentage points.
   - We first check each outcome’s probability against the 20% threshold to determine if any outcomes need their weights adjusted.
   
   **Lottery A:**
   - -6000 Euros with 25% probability (does not meet the <20% criterion for adjustment)
   - 0 Euros with 75% probability (does not meet the <20% criterion for adjustment)
   
   **Lottery B:**
   - -4000 Euros with 25% probability (does not meet the <20% criterion for adjustment)
   - -2000 Euros with 25% probability (does not meet the <20% criterion for adjustment)
   - 0 Euros with 50% probability (does not meet the <20% criterion for adjustment)
   
   - Since no outcomes have a probability of less than 20%, none of the probabilities need adjustment.

2. **Summarize the relevant information for weighting:**
   **Weighted probabilities for Lottery A:**
   - -6000 Euros with 25% probability
   - 0 Euros with 75% probability

   **Weighted probabilities for Lottery B:**
   - -4000 Euros with 25% probability
   - -2000 Euros with 25% probability
   - 0 Euros with 50% probability

3. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:**
   - Calculate the expected value (weighted sum of outcomes) for each lottery using their respective probabilities:
   
   **Lottery A:**
   - Expected value = (-6000 Euros * 0.25) + (0 Euros * 0.75)
                    = -1500 Euros
   
   **Lottery B:**
   - Expected value = (-4000 Euros * 0.25) + (-2000 Euros * 0.25) + (0 Euros * 0.50)
                    = -1000 Euros

   - Compare the expected values of the lotteries. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable (less negative) weighted sum of outcomes.
   - Lottery A has an expected value of -1500 Euros.
   - Lottery B has an expected value of -1000 Euros.

"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly to the decision problem.
    - Lottery A outcomes and probabilities:
        - -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability

    - Lottery B outcome and probability:
        - -5 Euros with 100% probability
    - The decision reason modifies probabilities less than 20% by increasing them by 10 percentage points.
    - Both lotteries' probabilities can be adjusted as per the decision reason:
        - For Lottery A: The probability of -5000 Euros (0.1%) is less than 20%, so it becomes 0.1% + 10% = 10.1%.
        - For Lottery A: The probability of 0 Euros (99.9%) is greater than 20%, so it remains 99.9%.
        - For Lottery B: The probability of -5 Euros (100%) is greater than 20%, so it remains 100%.

2. Summarize the relevant information after adjustments:
    - Adjusted Lottery A outcomes and probabilities:

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason adjusts the probabilities of outcomes less than 20% probability by increasing them by 10 percentage points.
- For Lottery A: both outcomes (3000 Euros at 50% and -3000 Euros at 50%) have probabilities greater than 20%. This means there are no probability adjustments needed for Lottery A.
- For Lottery B: the single outcome (1500 Euros at 100%) also has a probability greater than 20%. This means there are no probability adjustments needed for Lottery B.
- All relevant information about the lotteries' probabilities and outcomes has been derived.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- Since the decision reason only adjusts probabilities under 20% (and none of the probabilities in either lottery are under 20%), no adjustments to probabilities are made.
- The weighted sums of the outcomes are:
  - Lottery A: (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 1500 - 1500 = 0 Euros
  - Lottery B: (1500 Euros * 100%) = 1500 Euros

- Lottery A outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability, -3000 Euros with 50% probability.
- Lottery B outcomes: 2000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Both lotteries have probabilities (50% and 100%) that are not less than 20%. Therefore, none of the probabilities qualify for the 10 percentage points increase.

Since no probabilities fall under the ""small probability"" threshold (i.e., <20%), the relevant information to apply the decision reason cannot be derived.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason involves adjusting probabilities if they are less than 20%.
   - Evaluate probabilities:
     - Lottery A: 50% for both outcomes (3000, -3000), which is greater than 20%.
     - Lottery B: 100% for 1000, which is greater than 20%.
   - Since no probability is less than 20%, no adjustments are needed.
2. Summarize the relevant information.
   - Lottery A:
     - Outcome: 3000 Euros, Probability: 50%
     - Outcome: -3000 Euros, Probability: 50%
   - Lottery B:
     - Outcome: 1000 Euros, Probability: 100%
3. Apply the decision reason:
   - Calculate the weighted outcomes:
     - Lottery A: (3000 * 0.50) + (-3000 * 0.50) = 1500 - 1500 = 0 Euros
     - Lottery B: (1000 * 1.00) = 1000 Euros
   - Compare outcomes:
     - Lottery A: 0 Euros
     - Lottery B: 1000 Euros
   - The more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by probabilities is from Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if relevant information can be derived:
   - Lottery A outcomes: 
     - 6000 Euros with 50% probability
     - -6000 Euros with 50% probability
   - Lottery B outcome:
     - 0 Euros with 100% probability
     
   The decision reason considers outcomes with a probability of less than 20%. In both lotteries, none of the outcomes have a probability less than 20%. Thus, the reason does not alter any of the outcomes' probabilities.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - Lottery A:
     - The probability-weighted outcomes are:
       - 6000 Euros * 50% = 3000 Euros
       - -6000 Euros * 50% = -3000 Euros
     - Summing weighted outcomes: 3000 - 3000 = 0 Euros

   - Lottery B:
     - The probability-weighted outcome is:
       - 0 Euros * 100% = 0 Euros
     - Sum: 0 Euros

   Since the sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities for both lotteries is the same (0 Euros), the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.
