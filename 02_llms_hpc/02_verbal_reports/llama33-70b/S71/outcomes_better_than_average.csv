STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, calculated by taking the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The average outcome for both lotteries combined is (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. Thus, for Lottery A, there is 1 outcome (2500 Euros) higher than the average, and for Lottery B, there is 1 outcome (2400 Euros) lower than the average but since it's the only outcome, it's the one to consider. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the 1% chance of winning nothing, the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries, and the additional 100 Euro gain in Lottery A with a 33% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning its slightly higher expected value, the compensation of the 1% risk of winning nothing by the potential for an additional 100 Euro gain, and the secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses expected values, probabilities, and the potential for additional gain, not the count of outcomes above an average calculated from all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average, which is not the basis of the individual's justification. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the expected value, risk compensation, and the potential for additional earnings rather than the count of outcomes above a calculated average.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome of both lotteries. The justification provided is based on expected values, risk, and potential gains, which does not align with the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of the outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. Relevant information includes identifying outcomes higher than this average for each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcome 2500 Euros is higher than the average. For Lottery B, the outcome 2400 Euros is higher than the average. Thus, both lotteries have one outcome higher than the average outcome, making the decision reason applicable but resulting in a tie according to its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value and that the gains and probabilities are very similar. They also mention the difference between the possible gains is not very high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a slightly increased probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers expected values and the similarity in gains and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average, which would result in a tie in this case. The individual's justification is based on the slightly higher winning probability of Lottery B, not on the number of outcomes above an average.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus is on expected values and probabilities, not on the count of outcomes above a calculated average.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome. To apply this reason, we first need to calculate the average outcome of both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. Now, we compare each outcome to this average: Lottery A has 1 outcome (3000 Euros) that is higher than the average, and Lottery B has 1 outcome (4000 Euros) that is higher than the average and 1 outcome (0 Euros) that is lower. Thus, both lotteries have the same number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is 1. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the expected value of Lottery B being slightly higher than that of Lottery A and notes that Lottery A offers a secure win, while Lottery B offers a chance at a slightly increased win. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure win, despite Lottery B having a slightly higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected values and security of the win). The individual does not mention comparing the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is central to the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the larger number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (security of the win and comparison of expected values). The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as the decision was based on the security of the win and the comparison of expected values, not the count of outcomes above the average.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0) / 4 = 4000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The outcomes higher than the average are 3000 Euros from Lottery A and 4000 Euros from Lottery B. Thus, both lotteries have one outcome higher than the average outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B to be slightly higher, noted that the win in Lottery A is somewhat more probable, but the possible win in Lottery B is significantly higher, and the probabilities are very similar.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B due to its higher possible win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on expected value, probability of winning, and the magnitude of the possible win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average outcome, but the individual's justification was based on the higher possible win in Lottery B, not on comparing the number of outcomes above an average.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason's specific criteria (number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) do not align with the information considered or the justification provided by the individual. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the comparison of potential wins and their probabilities rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 / 4 = 1125 Euros. Thus, for Lottery A, there is 1 outcome (6000 Euros) higher than the average, and for Lottery B, there is 1 outcome (3000 Euros) higher than the average, but since 3000 Euros is actually lower than the calculated average, it seems there was a miscalculation in determining the relevant outcomes for comparison. Correctly, for both lotteries, we should compare their outcomes to the average outcome of 1125 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros is higher than 1125 Euros, and the outcome of 0 Euros is lower. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros is higher than 1125 Euros, and the outcome of 0 Euros is lower. So, both lotteries have 1 outcome higher than the average outcome. The decision reason is applicable but seems to lead to a tie based on the initial calculation error. Let's correct this understanding: Both lotteries have outcomes that are higher than the average outcome of 1125 Euros, specifically 6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B, making both relevant for comparison under the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, and they compare the probabilities of winning in each lottery, highlighting that Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high win, while Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of winning (or getting a positive outcome) is significantly higher with B than with A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which was miscalculated initially but correctly identified as relevant for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the expected value and the probability of winning, not directly on the number of outcomes higher than an average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer the lottery with more outcomes above the average, but since both have one such outcome, it doesn’t directly apply as a differentiator based on the corrected understanding. The individual’s justification is based on the probability of winning, not the specific rule of outcomes higher than an average.

Given these comparisons, the individual does not seem to directly apply the decision reason as described, focusing instead on probabilities and expected values rather than the count of outcomes exceeding a calculated average.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 / 4 = 1125 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying outcomes higher than this average for each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcome 6000 Euros is higher than the average, and for Lottery B, neither outcome (3000 Euros and 0 Euros) is higher than the average, but since 3000 Euros is actually lower than the calculated average, it's clear that Lottery A has outcomes higher than the average, and Lottery B does not, based on the calculation provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers a chance at a twice as high win. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the low probability of winning in both, Lottery A offers a higher potential win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification. The individual considers the expected value, the probability of winning, and the potential win amount.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes higher than the average outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the potential win amount and the expected value, not directly on comparing outcomes to an average.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the potential win and expected value rather than the number of outcomes above a calculated average.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, calculated by taking the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The average outcome is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The outcomes higher than this average for Lottery A are 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, there are no outcomes higher than the average since -3000 Euros is lower than -2333.33 Euros. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has 1 outcome higher than the average, and Lottery B has 0 outcomes higher than the average.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A has a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B. They also considered the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the probability of no loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having losses in the same order of magnitude, Lottery A offers a good chance of not losing anything, which was the decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected values and the probability of no loss, not the count of outcomes above a calculated average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average, but the individual’s justification is based on the avoidance of certain loss and the chance of no loss, not the comparison of outcomes to an average value.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the decision reason was not directly used by the individual, as the verbal report does not mention the count of outcomes above an average calculated from all outcomes, nor does it justify the choice based on this principle.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the average outcome of both lotteries and comparing the number of outcomes higher than this average for each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is calculated as the mean of all outcomes: (-3000 + 0 - 4000 + 0) / 4 = -3000 / 4 = -750 Euros. Relevant information includes identifying outcomes higher than -750 Euros for each lottery. For Lottery A, the outcome 0 Euros is higher than -750 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome 0 Euros is also higher than -750 Euros. Both lotteries have one outcome higher than the average outcome, so the decision reason can be applied but leads to indifference based on the given rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A to be slightly higher and noted that both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss. The individual also compared the loss amounts and their probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the loss is lower and only marginally more probable than in Lottery B, despite acknowledging a slightly higher expected value for A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected values and the comparison of loss amounts and their probabilities, not the count of outcomes above an average calculated from all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same number of outcomes above the average, but the individual's justification is based on expected value and the comparison of potential losses and their probabilities, not on counting outcomes above an average.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the count of outcomes higher than a calculated average outcome, which is not considered in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. Instead, the individual's choice is based on expected value and a direct comparison of potential losses and their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
9,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is calculated as (-3000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 4 = -4500 / 4 = -1125 Euros. This means any outcome above -1125 Euros is considered higher than the average. For Lottery A, the outcome 0 Euros is higher than the average, and for Lottery B, the outcome 0 Euros is also higher than the average. Both lotteries have one outcome higher than the average outcome. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied but would lead to indifference since both lotteries have the same number of outcomes above the average.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries offer the same expected value, both have a high probability of loss, but Lottery A has a higher probability of loss compared to Lottery B. They also mention that while the potential loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, the difference in probabilities makes Lottery B more preferable.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the potential loss being higher, the probability of losing in Lottery B is significantly lower than in Lottery A, which outweighs the difference in potential loss amounts.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers expected values and probabilities of loss, not the count of outcomes above a certain average.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have one outcome above the average, but the individual chose based on the difference in loss probabilities and the expected value, not the count of outcomes above an average.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make their decision. The focus on probabilities and expected values rather than the count of outcomes above an average outcome suggests a different decision-making process.

The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is calculated as (-3000 + 0 - 6000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The outcomes higher than this average for Lottery A are 0 Euros (since -3000 is lower than -2250, but 0 is higher), and for Lottery B, the outcome 0 Euros is also higher than -2250. Thus, both lotteries have one outcome higher than the average outcome. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries (mentioning they have the same expected value), the magnitude of potential losses in both lotteries (noting the loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A), and the low probabilities of these losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the potential loss is half that of Lottery B, despite both losses having low probabilities.

The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The average outcome is (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. Thus, for Lottery A, there is 1 outcome (1000 Euros) higher than the average, and for Lottery B, there are no outcomes higher than the average since its only outcome is exactly at the average. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which would be Lottery A based on this calculation.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries offer the same expected value and mentions the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B. They also consider the possibility of winning nothing with Lottery A and compare the magnitudes of possible gains from both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B due to its secure gain of 500 Euros, considering the risk of winning nothing with Lottery A and the comparable magnitudes of potential gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome for Lottery A is -500 Euros (since there's only one outcome), and for Lottery B, it's (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. The average outcome when considering both lotteries together is (-500 + (-1000 + 0)/2) / 2 = (-500 - 500) / 2 = -500 Euros. Lottery A has 0 outcomes higher than -500 Euros, and Lottery B has 1 outcome (0 Euros) higher than -500 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has more outcomes higher than the average outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, noting they are equal. They also considered the nature of the losses in both lotteries and the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite similar magnitudes of potential loss, Lottery B offers a 50% chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses expected values and the possibility of not losing anything, which indirectly relates to the concept of outcomes but does not directly address the average outcome or the count of outcomes above it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on the chance of not losing anything and similar loss magnitudes, not explicitly on the count of outcomes above an average.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the verbal report does not mention calculating or comparing the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome. However, the choice made (Lottery B) happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest, but the reasoning process described is based on different criteria (expected values and the possibility of no loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not indicate consideration of the specific criteria (number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) that the decision reason is based on. However, it is not a 0 because the chosen lottery aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, albeit for different stated reasons."
13,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The average outcome for Lottery A is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, it's (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. Since the decision reason requires comparing these averages to the individual outcomes to determine which lottery has more outcomes above the average, we need to calculate the average outcome across both lotteries. The combined average is (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2400 Euros. Now, we compare each lottery's outcomes to this average:
- Lottery A has 1 outcome (6000 Euros) higher than the average.
- Lottery B has 1 outcome (4000 Euros) higher than the average.
The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have 1 outcome higher than the combined average outcome of 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, that Lottery A offers a chance at a high gain, and that Lottery B offers a double chance at a similarly high or significantly lower gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a double chance of winning compared to Lottery A, and the potential winnings are in the same order of magnitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome across both lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses expected values and the number of chances to win, not the count of outcomes above a combined average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average, but the individual's justification is based on the expected value and the doubled chance of winning, not the number of outcomes above an average.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves counting outcomes higher than the average outcome across both lotteries. The verbal report focuses on expected values and chances of winning rather than the specific rule of comparing outcomes to a combined average.

14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to calculate the average outcome for both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, we compare each lottery's outcomes to its average. For Lottery A, only 0 Euros is higher than -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, -2000 Euros and 0 Euros are higher than -2000 Euros (since they are equal or higher). Thus, Lottery B has more outcomes higher than its average outcome than Lottery A does. The decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, the probability of loss, the size of potential losses, and the maximum loss in each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite having a higher probability of loss, the losses in B are smaller than the maximum loss in A, and the individual focused on the absolute size of the losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected value, probability of loss, size of losses, maximum loss), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual did not explicitly mention comparing the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with more outcomes higher than the average outcome) to the individual’s justification (focused on the size and probability of losses), the rationale provided by the individual does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the comparison of potential losses and their probabilities rather than the count of outcomes above an average threshold.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome or used this criterion to make their decision. Instead, the focus was on the size and probability of losses, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, calculated as the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. The average outcome is (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1666.67 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying outcomes higher than this average for each lottery. For Lottery A, there are no outcomes higher than 1666.67 Euros since its only outcome is 5 Euros. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome (5000 Euros) higher than the average. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, acknowledged the low probability of winning in Lottery B, and recognized the certain but small gain in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a small but certain gain, considering only one round of play is relevant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discussed the certainty of the gain and the low probability of winning in Lottery B, not directly addressing the concept of outcomes relative to an average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average outcome, which would actually suggest preferring Lottery B due to its one outcome being above the average. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the certainty of its outcome, not the number of outcomes above an average.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A, indicating a different decision-making criterion was applied."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is calculated by taking the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The average outcome is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the number of outcomes higher than this average for each lottery. For Lottery A, one outcome (0 Euros) is higher than the average, and for Lottery B, the outcome (-5 Euros) is higher than the average. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a small but certain loss, and Lottery A has a very low probability of a very high loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the possible loss in Lottery A is much higher, and the loss in Lottery B is very small.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the expected value, the certainty of the loss in Lottery B, and the high potential loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which does not align with the individual’s justification that focuses on the magnitude of potential losses and the certainty of loss in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on expected value, the certainty of loss, and the magnitude of potential losses does not reflect the decision reason's criteria of comparing the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The average outcome is (1500 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying outcomes higher than this average (0) for each lottery. Lottery A has 1 outcome (1500 Euros) higher than 0, and Lottery B has 1 outcome (3000 Euros) higher than 0. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain of Lottery A, the chance of doubling the amount with Lottery B, and the equal chance of a high loss with Lottery B. They also mention the expected value of Lottery B being lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain and Lottery B has a lower expected value, implying a preference for the certainty of a gain over the risk of loss despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the security of the gain, the potential for doubling, the risk of loss, and the expected value, not the count of outcomes above an average calculated from all outcomes without weighting by probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average outcome, which is not the basis of the individual's justification. The individual's choice was based on the security of the gain and the expected value, not on counting outcomes above a certain threshold.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The average outcome is (3000 - 3000 + 2000) / 3 = 0. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A has 1 outcome (3000 Euros) higher than the average outcome (0 Euros).
- Lottery B has 1 outcome (2000 Euros) higher than the average outcome (0 Euros).
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the security of the gain offered by Lottery B, its higher expected value compared to Lottery A, the chance of a higher gain with Lottery A, and the equal chance of a high loss with Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a secure gain and has a much higher expected value compared to Lottery A, despite Lottery A offering a chance at a slightly higher gain but also a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected values and security, not the count of outcomes above an average calculated from all outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the security of the gain and the expected value, not on comparing the number of outcomes above an average.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The focus was on expected value and risk rather than the count of outcomes above a certain threshold.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The average outcome is (1000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The number of outcomes higher than the average for Lottery A is 1 (since 1000 > 0), and for Lottery B, it is 1 (since 3000 > 0). Therefore, both lotteries have the same number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is 1.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the expected values of both lotteries and notes that Lottery A has an expected value of 1000 Euros, while Lottery B has an expected value of 0 Euros. They also acknowledge the possibility of winning three times more with Lottery B but weigh it against the equal probability of losing 3000 Euros. Second, the individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by highlighting its secure gain of 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected values, probability of winning/losing), it appears the individual focused more on the expected values and the certainty of the outcome rather than the specific rule of counting outcomes above the average. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger number of outcomes higher than the average outcome) does not directly align with the individual's justification (focusing on the secure gain and expected values). Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, where the average outcome is the mean of outcomes from both lotteries without weighting by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. The average outcome for Lottery B is (6000 + (-6000))/2 = 0 Euros. Since Lottery A has only one outcome (0 Euros), and the average outcome of both lotteries is 0 Euros, we can derive that Lottery A has no outcomes higher than the average (since its only outcome is exactly the average), and Lottery B has one outcome (6000 Euros) higher than the average. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a chance for a high gain but also a high loss, and Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. They specifically mention the high possible loss in Lottery B and its significant probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the possible loss in Lottery B is very high and has a moderate probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the expected value, potential gains, and losses, which is related but not directly aligned with comparing outcomes to their average.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with more outcomes above the average, but the individual’s justification is based on avoiding a high loss due to its significant probability, not on comparing the number of outcomes above an average.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the avoidance of loss and the concept of expected value rather than the specific rule of outcomes above the average outcome.
