   - Lottery B: Maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and minimum outcome is 2400 Euros (since there is only one outcome). The difference between maximum and minimum is 2400 - 2400 = 0 Euros.
3. Compare the differences calculated: Lottery A has a difference of 2500 Euros and Lottery B has a difference of 0 Euros. According to the decision reason, the lottery with the larger difference is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the lotteries: 
   - For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros (with 33% probability) and 0 Euros (with 67% probability). The difference between the maximum (2500) and the minimum (0) outcomes is: 
   \( 2500 - 0 = 2500 \) Euros.
   
   - For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros (with 34% probability) and 0 Euros (with 66% probability). The difference between the maximum (2400) and the minimum (0) outcomes is: 
   \( 2400 - 0 = 2400 \) Euros.

2. Apply the decision reason: 
   - The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. 
   - Comparing the two differences: 
   Lottery A has a difference of 2500 Euros, and Lottery B has a difference of 2400 Euros. 
   
   Since 2500 (Lottery A) is greater than 2400 (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Identify the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. 
- Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with an 80% probability and 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, giving a difference of 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with 100% probability. Here, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros, giving a difference of 3000 - 3000 = 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Compare the differences in outcomes. 
- The difference for Lottery A is 4000 Euros, while for Lottery B it is 0 Euros. Since 4000 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 0 Euros (Lottery B), according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred due to having a larger difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assessing the outcomes of each lottery:
- Lottery A offers 4000 Euros (maximum) with a 20% probability and 0 Euros (minimum) with an 80% probability, resulting in a difference of 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros (maximum) with a 25% probability and 0 Euros (minimum) with a 75% probability, resulting in a difference of 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros.

Since the relevant information about the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes can be derived from the lotteries, I will proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Comparing the differences:
- The difference for Lottery A is 4000 Euros.
- The difference for Lottery B is 3000 Euros.
