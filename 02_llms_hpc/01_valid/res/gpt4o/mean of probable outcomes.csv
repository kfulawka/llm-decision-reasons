mean of probable outcomes
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied:
   - Lottery A has three outcomes: 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros with probabilities 33%, 66%, and 1% respectively.
   - Lottery B has one outcome: 2400 Euros with 100% probability.
   - Determine if the probabilities are greater than the threshold defined by the decision reason (1 / number of outcomes). For Lottery A, the threshold is 1 / 3 = 33.33%. For Lottery B, the threshold is 1 / 1 = 100%.
   
2. Calculate the probable outcomes:
   - For Lottery A, only the outcomes with probabilities greater than 33.33% are considered. 2400 Euros with 66% probability is the only probable outcome since 33% < 33.33% and 1% < 33.33%.
   - For Lottery B, 2400 Euros with 100% probability is the only outcome and is also probable since 100% > 100%.

3. Summarize the results for Lottery A and B:
   - Lottery A: Probable outcome is 2400 Euros.
   - Lottery B: Probable outcome is 2400 Euros.

4. Compare the average of probable outcomes:
   - Lottery A has an average probable outcome of 2400 Euros.
   - Lottery B has an average probable outcome of 2400 Euros.

5. Apply the decision reason:
   - Since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome, the decision reason does not prefer one over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.
- Both Lottery A and Lottery B have two outcomes each.
- The threshold for an outcome to be categorized as probable is 1 / 2 = 0.5 (50%).
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes:
  - 2500 Euros (33%) probability, which is less than 50%, so not probable.
  - 0 Euros (67%) probability, which is more than 50%, so probable.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcomes:
  - 2400 Euros (34%) probability, which is less than 50%, so not probable.
  - 0 Euros (66%) probability, which is more than 50%, so probable.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros.
- Since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes, they are equally preferred by the decision reason.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:

Step 1: Assess relevant information for the decision reason.
- Lottery A offers two outcomes: 4000 Euros (80% probability) and 0 Euros (20% probability).
- Lottery B offers one outcome: 3000 Euros (100% probability).

Determine the probable outcomes for each lottery:
- For Lottery A: There are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 (i.e., 50%). 
  - 4000 Euros (80% probability) qualifies as probable.
  - 0 Euros (20% probability) does not qualify as probable.
- For Lottery B: There is 1 outcome, so an outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 (i.e., 100%). 
  - 3000 Euros (100% probability) qualifies as probable.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Probable outcome(s) = 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B: Probable outcome(s) = 3000 Euros.
- Average of probable outcomes for Lottery A = 4000 Euros.
- Average of probable outcomes for Lottery B = 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.
  - Average of probable outcomes for Lottery A = 4000 Euros.
  - Average of probable outcomes for Lottery B = 3000 Euros. 
- Lottery A has a higher average of probable outcomes (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner:
   - The decision reason divides outcomes into probable and not probable.
   - Calculate the threshold probability: one divided by the number of outcomes.
   
   For both lotteries A and B, we have:
   
   Lottery A:
   - Number of outcomes: 2
   - Threshold probability = 1 / 2 = 0.5 (50%)

   Lottery B:
   - Number of outcomes: 2
   - Threshold probability = 1 / 2 = 0.5 (50%)
   
   Neither lottery has a probable outcome because the probabilities for winning (20% and 25%) are both below 50%.

   Therefore, the relevant information can be derived: both lotteries have no probable outcomes.

2. Apply the decision reason's rule:
   - Since neither A nor B has probable outcomes (i.e., all potential outcomes have probabilities below 50%), there are no probable outcomes to consider.
   - The decision reason does not prefer one lottery over the other based on the given rule as there are no probable outcomes to calculate averages from.

   - For Lottery A: Only the outcome of 0 Euros is probable.
     - Average of probable outcomes for Lottery A = 0 Euros
   - For Lottery B: Only the outcome of 3000 Euros is probable.
     - Average of probable outcomes for Lottery B = 3000 Euros

5. Compare the averages of the probable outcomes:
   - The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
   - The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 3000 Euros.

6. Apply the decision reason's rule:
   - Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, and the average for Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that for Lottery A (0 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

   - Both Lottery A and Lottery B have a higher average of probable outcomes of 0 Euros, as they share the same probable outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess the probable outcomes for each lottery:
   - Lottery A has two outcomes: 1000 Euros with 50% probability and 0 Euros with 50% probability. According to the decision reason, an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. Lottery A has 2 outcomes, so the threshold probability is 1/2 = 50%. Both outcomes meet this threshold, therefore both are considered probable outcomes.
   - Lottery B has one outcome: 500 Euros with 100% probability. With 1 outcome, the threshold probability is 1/1 = 100%. This outcome meets the threshold and is considered a probable outcome.

2. Calculate the average of probable outcomes:
   - For Lottery A: (1000 Euros * 50% + 0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros.
   - For Lottery B: 500 Euros since it is the only outcome and thus the average of the probable outcomes.

3. Compare the averages of probable outcomes:
   - Lottery A's average of probable outcomes is 500 Euros.
   - Lottery B's average of probable outcomes is 500 Euros.
   - Both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner by deriving relevant information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.
   - Lottery A offers two outcomes with equal probabilities: -1000 Euros (50%) and 0 Euros (50%).
   - Lottery B offers one outcome with certainty: -500 Euros (100%).
   - For Lottery A, the probability threshold for probable outcomes is 1/(number of outcomes) = 1/2 = 50%. Both outcomes (-1000 and 0 Euros) meet this threshold.
   - For Lottery B, there is only one outcome (-500 Euros) with 100% probability, which meets the threshold.
   - Therefore, we can derive and summarize the relevant information for probable outcomes:
     - Lottery A probable outcomes: -1000 Euros and 0 Euros
     - Lottery B probable outcome: -500 Euros

    - Lottery B has 3 outcomes: 4000 Euros (25%), 2000 Euros (25%), and 0 Euros (50%).
    - For Lottery A: The cutoff probability for an outcome to be probable is \( \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.
    - For Lottery B: The cutoff probability for an outcome to be probable is \( \frac{1}{3} \) or approximately 33.33%.
    - Based on these probabilities:
        - For Lottery A: No outcome has a probability higher than 50%, so no outcomes are probable.
        - For Lottery B: No outcome has a probability higher than 33.33%, so no outcomes are probable.

       - 0 Euros with a probability of 75% (which is > 50%)
     - The relevant information is: probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. First, assess if the decision reason can be strictly applied to the decision problem by evaluating the probable outcomes of each lottery.
   - Lottery A has two outcomes: 5000 Euros with a probability of 0.1% and 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%.
     - Since there are two outcomes, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 (50%).
     - Neither of the outcomes in Lottery A has a probability higher than 50%, so there are no probable outcomes in Lottery A.
   - Lottery B has one outcome: 5 Euros with a probability of 100%.
     - With only one outcome, it is automatically probable since 100% is higher than 100% (1/1).
     - Therefore, the only probable outcome in Lottery B is 5 Euros.

2. Summarizing the information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason:
   - Lottery A has no probable outcomes.
   - Lottery B has one probable outcome of 5 Euros.

3. Apply the decision reason to determine the preferred lottery:
   - According to the decision reason, we should compare the average of the probable outcomes between Lottery A and Lottery B.
   - Lottery A has no probable outcomes, so its average cannot be calculated and can be considered 0 for practical purposes.
   - Lottery B has a probable outcome of 5 Euros with an average of 5 Euros.

   Since Lottery B has a higher average of probable outcomes (5 Euros) compared to Lottery A (0 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

   - Lottery A has two outcomes: -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability, and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
   - Lottery B has one outcome: -5 Euros with 100% probability.
   - In Lottery A, the threshold for considering an outcome probable is 1 divided by 2 (since there are two outcomes), which equals 0.5 or 50%.
   - In Lottery B, the threshold for considering an outcome probable is 1 divided by 1 (since there is only one outcome), which equals 1 or 100%.

2. **Determine probable outcomes:**
   - For Lottery A, neither outcome is probable since both probabilities (0.1% and 99.9%) are not higher than 50%.
   - For Lottery B, the single outcome -5 Euros with 100% probability is probable since 100% is higher than the threshold of 100%.

3. **Calculate average of probable outcomes:**
   - Lottery A has no probable outcomes, and thus no average can be calculated.
   - Lottery B has one probable outcome of -5 Euros, so the average of probable outcomes is -5 Euros.

4. **Apply the decision reason:**
   - Since Lottery A does not have any probable outcomes, its average cannot be calculated.
   - Lottery B has a clear average of its probable outcome, which is -5 Euros.
   - Therefore, decision reason prefers the lottery with the calculable average of probable outcomes. Given that Lottery B has a calculable average and A does not, Lottery B is selected.

   - For lottery A: 1/2 = 0.5 (which matches the provided probability).
   - For lottery B: 1/1 = 1 (which matches the provided probability).
   - Thus, we can categorize the probable outcomes.

2. Identify the probable outcomes of each lottery.
   - For lottery A, both outcomes (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros) are probable since their probability (50%) is greater than or equal to 0.5.
   - For lottery B, the outcome (1500 Euros) is probable since its probability (100%) is greater than or equal to 1.

   - Lottery A probable outcomes: 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros.
   - Lottery B probable outcome: 2000 Euros.
   
   Calculate the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery:
   - The average of Lottery Aâ€™s probable outcomes = (3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros))/2 = 0 Euros.
   - The average of Lottery Bâ€™s probable outcome = 2000 Euros.
