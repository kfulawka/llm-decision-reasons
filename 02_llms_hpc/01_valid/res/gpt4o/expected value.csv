expected value
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason requires the calculation of the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value can be calculated using the outcomes and their respective probabilities.

2. Calculate the expected value of each lottery:
   - Lottery A:
     EV(A) = (2500 Euros * 0.33) + (2400 Euros * 0.66) + (0 Euros * 0.01)
           = 825 Euros + 1584 Euros + 0 Euros
           = 2409 Euros
   - Lottery B:
     EV(B) = 2400 Euros * 1
           = 2400 Euros

3. Compare the expected values:
   - EV(A) = 2409 Euros
   - EV(B) = 2400 Euros

4. Determine which lottery is preferred based on the higher expected value:
   - Since 2409 Euros (EV of A) is greater than 2400 Euros (EV of B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Determine the expected value of Lottery A:
   - Lottery A offers 2500 Euros with a 33% probability and 0 Euros with a 67% probability.
   - The expected value (EV) is calculated as: 
     EV(A) = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67)
            = 825 + 0
            = 825 Euros

2. Determine the expected value of Lottery B:
   - Lottery B offers 2400 Euros with a 34% probability and 0 Euros with a 66% probability.
   - The expected value (EV) is calculated as:
     EV(B) = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66)
            = 816 + 0
            = 816 Euros

3. Compare the expected values of Lottery A and Lottery B:
   - EV(A) = 825 Euros
   - EV(B) = 816 Euros
   - Since the expected value of Lottery A (825 Euros) is higher than the expected value of Lottery B (816 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Identify the expected value (EV) for each lottery:
   - EV of Lottery A = (4000 * 0.80) + (0 * 0.20) = 3200 Euros
   - EV of Lottery B = 3000 * 1.00 = 3000 Euros

2. Compare the expected values:
   - EV of Lottery A (3200 Euros) is greater than EV of Lottery B (3000 Euros)

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Calculate the expected value of Lottery A:
   - Expected value of Lottery A = (4000 Euros * 20%) + (0 Euros * 80%)
   - Expected value of Lottery A = 800 Euros + 0 Euros = 800 Euros

2. Calculate the expected value of Lottery B:
   - Expected value of Lottery B = (3000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 75%)
   - Expected value of Lottery B = 750 Euros + 0 Euros = 750 Euros

3. Compare the expected values:
   - Expected value of Lottery A = 800 Euros
   - Expected value of Lottery B = 750 Euros

4. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, and Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B,

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Expected value calculation for Lottery A:
- Outcome 1: 6000 Euros with 45% probability -> (6000 * 0.45) = 2700 Euros
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 55% probability -> (0 * 0.55) = 0 Euros
- Total expected value for Lottery A = 2700 + 0 = 2700 Euros

Expected value calculation for Lottery B:
- Outcome 1: 3000 Euros with 90% probability -> (3000 * 0.90) = 2700 Euros
- Outcome 2: 0 Euros with 10% probability -> (0 * 0.10) = 0 Euros
- Total expected value for Lottery B = 2700 + 0 = 2700 Euros

Summarized information relevant to the decision reason:
- Expected value for Lottery A = 2700 Euros
- Expected value for Lottery B = 2700 Euros

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- Since the expected value for both lotteries is equal (2700 Euros), the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess whether the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner.
   - The reason involves calculating the expected value of each lottery.
   - Expected value (EV) is calculated as: 
     EV = (Outcome1 * Probability1) + (Outcome2 * Probability2) + ... + (OutcomeN * ProbabilityN)
   - We can derive the expected values from the information provided for both lotteries.

2. Calculate the expected value for Lottery A:
   - Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, both with a probability of 50%.
   - Expected value of Lottery A:

"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the relevant information (expected value) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Yes, the expected value can be derived from the given probabilities and outcomes.
    - Lottery A: The expected value (EV) is calculated as:
      EV(A) = (0.5 * 3000) + (0.5 * -3000) = 1500 - 1500 = 0 Euros.

    - EV(B) = 1000 Euros
3. Apply the decision reason to prefer the lottery with the higher expected value.
    - EV(B) is greater than EV(A), hence Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason here is based on the expected value of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery can be calculated using the formula: 

Expected Value = (Probability of outcome 1 * Value of outcome 1) + (Probability of outcome 2 * Value of outcome 2) + ...

For Lottery A:
- Outcome 1: 6000 Euros with a 50% probability (0.5)
- Outcome 2: -6000 Euros with a 50% probability (0.5)

Expected Value of Lottery A:
= (0.5 * 6000) + (0.5 * -6000)
= 3000 + (-3000)
= 0 Euros

For Lottery B:
- Outcome: 0 Euros with a 100% probability (1.0)

Expected Value of Lottery B:
= 1.0 * 0
= 0 Euros

Thus, we can derive the relevant information:
- Expected Value of Lottery A: 0 Euros
- Expected Value of Lottery B: 0 Euros

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. In this case, both Lottery A and Lottery B have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason is indifferent between them.
