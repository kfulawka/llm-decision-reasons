STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 2400 Euros.
- Lottery B: 33% chance of 2500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the potential additional 100 Euros of Lottery B, along with the risk of not winning anything in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential additional 100 Euros in Lottery B were not worth the risk of not making any gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process. The individual seems more focused on the guaranteed win and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than the probability of achieving the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (since 33% is less than 100%). However, the individual's justification is based on the risk aversion to not winning anything and the guaranteed win of Lottery A, not directly on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's focus on the guaranteed win and the risk of not winning anything suggests a different rationale for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery, which is 33% for A and 34% for B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the probabilities and gains of the two lotteries and noted that the possible gain in A was not much higher than in B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a higher probability of winning, given that the difference in potential gains between A and B was not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 33% for A and 34% for B. The individual considered the probabilities and gains but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification was based on preferring a higher probability of winning, not specifically addressing the probability of the maximum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus was on the overall probability of winning and the comparative gains, rather than specifically on the probability of the maximum outcome as the decision reason dictates. The verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with an 80% probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 80% chance of 4000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared probabilities and gains, noting that Lottery B is a sure win. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual wanted to avoid risk, which is why they chose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. 
The individual considered probabilities and the fact that B is a sure win, but there's no direct mention of comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as per the decision reason. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (80% < 100%). 
However, the individual chose Lottery B because it is a sure win, indicating a preference for avoiding risk rather than following the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on avoiding risk and preferring a sure gain, not on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and gains, noting that the higher gain was not much higher than the one with the higher probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on a higher probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considered both probabilities and gains but emphasized the comparison of probabilities and the choice based on a higher probability. However, the individual's focus was on the ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (higher probability) which seems to contradict the decision reason that prefers the lower probability of the maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B with 20% probability for the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, suggests they chose based on a ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (higher probability), which aligns with Lottery A's 25% being higher than Lottery B's 20% but contradicts the decision reason's preference for the lower probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 90% for A and 45% for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the good winning chances at Lottery A, the absence of a threatening loss, and compared the winning probabilities between A and B, noting that A's winning probability is much higher than B's.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing A because of its higher winning probability, implying that the high probability of winning at A was a key factor in their decision. They also mentioned that the potential win amount of B became irrelevant due to its lower winning probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which the individual did consider but with an opposite preference (they preferred the higher probability of winning).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual chose the lottery with the higher probability of winning, indicating they did not follow the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A's maximum outcome probability: 0.1%
- Lottery B's maximum outcome probability: 0.2%
Since the decision reason can be applied by comparing these probabilities, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and assumed they would win 0 Euros, making the choice between lotteries seemingly indifferent to them. However, they also noted the higher probability associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning its higher probability, implying they preferred the option with a higher chance of winning, even though they initially suggested the outcome of 0 Euros made the choice indifferent.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 0.1% for Lottery A and 0.2% for Lottery B. The individual considered probabilities but focused on the higher probability of winning (in the context of winning 0 Euros, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the task) and then chose based on a higher probability, but without directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher probability, which contradicts the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B (preferring the higher probability of winning) directly contradicts the decision reason's rule (preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome), indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome (0 Euros, or no loss) has a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of the least negative (which is still a loss, -3000 Euros) has a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high losses in both lotteries, the difference in potential loss between A and B, and the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual weighed whether the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A was worth the potentially higher loss compared to Lottery B and decided it was, given that 20% was not considered an extremely low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which in this case is the probability of not losing (20% for A). The individual considered this aspect (the 20% chance of no loss in A) among other factors.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A because it has a lower probability (20%) of its maximum outcome (no loss) compared to Lottery B (100% probability of its maximum outcome in the context of least negative loss). The individual's justification for choosing A was based on the perceived value of the 20% chance of no loss, which aligns with considering the probability of the maximum outcome but does not directly state a preference for the lower probability of the maximum outcome as the sole or primary reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment indicates that while the individual considered the probability of the maximum outcome (no loss) in Lottery A, which is a key aspect of the decision reason, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was made solely or primarily because Lottery A has a lower probability of its maximum outcome compared to Lottery B. The individual's justification seems to weigh the value of the 20% chance against the potential higher loss, rather than directly preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome as the decision reason would dictate. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was the primary basis for the choice, but there are indications that aspects of it were considered."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. In this case, the maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros (since the other outcomes are losses), but the decision reason seems to be aimed at minimizing the probability of the worst outcome (in this context, the highest loss). For Lottery B, the probability of the worst outcome (-4000 Euros) is 20%, and for Lottery A, the probability of the worst outcome (-3000 Euros) is 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the worst outcomes in each lottery, which are 20% for Lottery B and 25% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities and compared the possible loss amounts of the two lotteries. They focused on the aspect of having a lower probability of a loss rather than the amount of the loss itself, indicating they were concerned with the likelihood of incurring any loss.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating they preferred a lower probability of a loss over a smaller loss amount, because even the smaller loss was considered very high. This implies the individual prioritized the probability of avoiding a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the worst outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and loss amounts), we see the individual did consider probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on probabilities. However, the individual's focus was more on avoiding any loss rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum (or in this case, the least negative) outcomes as the decision reason would suggest.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, interpreted here as the worst loss) to the individual’s justification (preferring a lower probability of any loss), we observe a similarity in the concern for probabilities but a difference in the specific focus (worst outcome vs. any loss). The individual's justification does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the worst outcomes but does indicate a preference for lower probabilities of loss, which could indirectly align with the decision reason if considering the context of avoiding losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities and had a preference that could be seen as aligning with the decision reason (in terms of preferring lower probabilities of undesirable outcomes), their justification and focus did not directly match the decision reason's specific rule about comparing probabilities of the maximum (or worst) outcomes. The individual's reasoning was more about avoiding any loss, which, although related, does not perfectly align with the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (no loss) with a probability of 10% (since 90% is the probability of the loss, implying 10% for no loss). For Lottery B, the maximum outcome (no loss) is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 55%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of not incurring a loss in each lottery, which can be derived from the given probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and losses between the two lotteries, focusing on the likelihood of incurring a loss and considering whether the higher loss in one lottery was worth the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of not incurring a loss (or, implicitly, the probability of the maximum outcome of 0 Euros) was over 50% for A and ""nur bei 10%"" (only at 10%) for B, which seems to be a misunderstanding or misstatement since the probability of no loss is actually 55% for B and 10% for A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (no loss), but the individual seems to have misinterpreted or miscalculated these probabilities in their justification.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (no loss), which would actually be Lottery A with a 10% chance of no loss, aligning with the choice made but not the reasoning provided in the verbal report, as the individual mistakenly believed Lottery B had a lower probability of no loss.

Given the misinterpretation of probabilities in the verbal report and the focus on the wrong aspect of the decision reason, it seems the individual did not accurately apply the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (0.1% for Lottery B and 0.2% for Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and losses, noting that a loss was very unlikely in both options but slightly more probable in one, with the loss being twice as high in that option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the comparison of probabilities and the magnitude of potential losses, considering both the likelihood and the severity of the loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the probability of the maximum outcome, whereas the individual considered both the probability and the magnitude of the loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (0.1% probability of -6000 Euros). However, the individual's justification mentions considering the magnitude of the loss as well, not just the probability of the maximum outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process involved more factors than just the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual considered both the probability and the magnitude of the potential loss, which aligns partially with the decision reason but also introduces an additional consideration (the magnitude of the loss) not part of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual did consider the probabilities, which is part of the decision reason, the focus on the magnitude of the loss as a deciding factor introduces uncertainty about whether the decision reason was the primary or sole basis for the choice. The individual's process does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring solely based on the probability of the maximum outcome."

The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain at Lottery B, the probabilities at Lottery A, and compared the gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the additional 500 Euros were not worth the risk of making no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual considered the certainty of the gain and the risk of no gain, which indirectly relates to the probability of outcomes but does not directly match the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (50% for 1000 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the risk associated with Lottery A, which suggests they prioritized certainty over the probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome (-500 Euros) with 0% probability (since the maximum outcome in this context refers to the best possible outcome, which for Lottery A is not applicable as it only has a loss), but effectively, its ""best"" outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome (0 Euros) with 50% probability.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and losses, comparing them to determine if a possible higher loss is worth the chance of no loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the difference in potential losses (500 Euros more in one case) and considered 50% a good or fair chance, implying the attractiveness of the no-loss outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which in this case would be the probability of 0 Euros for Lottery B (50%) since it's the only ""maximum"" or best outcome between the two. The individual considered probabilities and the potential for no loss, aligning with the concept of evaluating the best outcome's probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's justification seems to favor the lottery with a chance of no loss (Lottery B), which has a 50% probability of its maximum outcome (0 Euros), over the certain loss of Lottery A. This does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual appears to be attracted to the higher probability of avoiding loss rather than strictly following the rule of preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the chance of no loss and the comparison of probabilities and losses does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason, which prioritizes the lottery with the lower probability of its maximum outcome. The verbal report suggests the individual was more influenced by the potential to avoid loss and the perceived value of the 50% chance than by the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, also with a probability of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and gains, noticing a 50% chance of winning at Lottery A, which they perceived as double the chance compared to Lottery B. They mentioned that the differences in gain amounts were irrelevant to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the comparison of probabilities, specifically mentioning the perceived higher chance of winning something in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, without considering the actual maximum outcome probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (25% for both lotteries), but the individual focused on the overall chance of winning any amount, not specifically the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on a different aspect (the overall chance of winning any amount, and the perceived doubling of this chance in Lottery A compared to B).

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery. The individual's focus was on the overall probability of winning and not on the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (no loss), and its probability is 75%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros (no loss), and its probability is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 75% chance of no loss (0 Euros)
- Lottery B: 50% chance of no loss (0 Euros)
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, it would prefer Lottery B because 50% (Lottery B) is less than 75% (Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared probabilities and outcomes. They considered the likelihood of not making a loss in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification focuses on the high probability of not making a loss in Lottery A and the high probability of a loss in Lottery B, even a smaller one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of not making a loss (which aligns with the maximum outcome of 0 Euros in both lotteries), which is relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (no loss), which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification seems to favor Lottery A because of its high probability of no loss, which contradicts the decision reason's rule.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 5 Euros
- Lottery B: 0.1% chance of 5000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities, noting that a win in Lottery B was very unlikely (0.1% probability) compared to Lottery A, which had a 100% chance of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual stated that after considering the probabilities, the differences in win amounts (""Gewinnhöhen-Unterschiede"") no longer played a role in their decision. This implies that the probability comparison was the decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities of winning in each lottery, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, suggests they were swayed by the certainty of winning in Lottery A, not explicitly preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome as stated in the decision reason. Instead, their focus was on the high probability of winning in Lottery A, which seems to contradict the decision reason's preference for the lower probability of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that they prioritized the certainty of winning over the probability of the maximum outcome, which contradicts the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery B's maximum outcome (0 Euros) has a 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A's maximum outcome (-5 Euros) has a 100% probability.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual compared the probabilities and initially considered choosing Lottery B because a 0 Euro outcome is very likely. They then thought about avoiding a small risk by choosing Lottery A, implying they considered the risk associated with the outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by considering the trade-off between the certainty of a small loss (Lottery A) and the high probability of no loss but a small chance of a significant loss (Lottery B), focusing on risk avoidance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the probabilities but focused more on the aspect of risk avoidance and the certainty of outcomes rather than specifically comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of its maximum outcome but rather on avoiding risk, which indirectly relates to the probabilities but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of probabilities and risk avoidance aligns somewhat with the general idea of evaluating lotteries based on their outcomes and probabilities. However, the specific rule of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) is not explicitly applied in the individual's justification. The focus on risk avoidance and the certainty of a small loss versus a high probability of no loss introduces a different criterion than the one specified by the decision reason. Thus, while there is some overlap in considering probabilities, the decision reason as stated does not directly guide the individual's decision-making process as described."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% probability of the maximum outcome (3000 Euros)
- Lottery B: 100% probability of the maximum outcome (1500 Euros)
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the certain gain of Lottery B and the probabilities of Lottery A, specifically mentioning the 50% risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice of Lottery B by perceiving the 50% chance of loss in Lottery A as risky and viewing Lottery B as a good option due to its certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, but the individual's consideration was more about the risk of loss and the certainty of gain, not directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (50% probability of the maximum outcome) over Lottery B (100% probability of the maximum outcome). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing its certainty as a reason, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% probability of the maximum outcome (3000 Euros)
- Lottery B: 100% probability of the maximum outcome (2000 Euros)
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of both lotteries and noted that both gains were high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a secure gain, and Lottery A was deemed too risky due to the absence of a guaranteed win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision. The individual considered probabilities and gains but emphasized the security of the gain in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual chose Lottery B, which has a 100% probability of its maximum outcome, over Lottery A, which has a 50% probability of its maximum outcome. The individual's justification (focusing on the security of the gain) does not align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 50% for B and 100% for A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed gain in Lottery A. They focused on the risk aspect, specifically mentioning the potential for loss in B and the safety of A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating they wanted to avoid risk, opting for the safe gain offered by Lottery A over the risky option of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for choosing between the lotteries. Instead, the individual talks about avoiding risk and the guarantee of a gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (50% probability of the maximum outcome). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing a desire to avoid risk, not explicitly considering the probability of the maximum outcomes as stated by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on avoiding risk and preferring a guaranteed gain, rather than on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros, but since it's the only outcome, it has a 100% probability. However, since 0 Euros is not a ""maximum"" outcome in the context of seeking gain (it's neutral), we interpret the reason as focusing on the probability of achieving a positive maximum outcome. Thus, for Lottery B, there's no positive maximum outcome to consider, implying its ""effective"" probability for the decision reason's purpose could be seen as 0% for a gain. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities of the maximum positive outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a significant loss with Lottery A (50% chance of losing 6000 Euros) and noted that with Lottery B, there would be neither loss nor gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Lottery A too risky due to the potential for a large loss and considered Lottery B more sensible because it offered no risk of loss or gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which in this context is about the probability of achieving a significant gain. The individual, however, focused on the risk of loss and the absence of risk in Lottery B, not explicitly on the probability of the maximum gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification was based on risk aversion regarding potential losses rather than the probability of achieving the maximum gain. The individual's decision seems to be more about avoiding risk than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on risk aversion and avoiding loss rather than comparing probabilities of maximum outcomes suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
