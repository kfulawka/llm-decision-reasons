STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros (since there is only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a larger difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes compared to Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""sehr geringe Verlustrisiko"" (very low risk of loss), which implies that they considered the risk or probability of losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that the low risk of loss ""ist dem Gewinn trotzdem nicht wert"" (is not worth the gain), suggesting that they weighed the potential gain against the risk and decided the gain was not sufficient to justify the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which directly relates to the potential gain and the risk of loss. The individual considered the risk of loss but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification implies they prioritized avoiding the risk of loss over the potential for a higher gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's focus on the risk of loss and the value of the gain does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries. The verbal report suggests the individual made their decision based on a risk assessment rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case would be Lottery B because 2500 > 2400.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (higher probability) and compares it to ""nur 100 Euro mehr Gewinn"" (just 100 Euros more in winnings), indicating they considered the probabilities and the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize the higher probability over the slightly higher potential winnings, suggesting their decision is based on a comparison of these factors.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor. The individual discusses probability and the difference in potential winnings, not the range of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification seems to focus on the probability and the incremental difference in winnings, not the range of possible outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, they discuss probability and the incremental difference in potential winnings, suggesting that a different decision-making process was used. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""kein Risiko"" which translates to ""no risk"" and ""100 Prozent Gewinn"" which translates to ""100 percent win"". This suggests the individual considered the aspect of risk (or certainty) of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize avoiding risk and ensuring a 100% win, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which doesn't directly align with the individual's focus on avoiding risk and ensuring a 100% win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, but the individual's justification suggests a preference for Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win, thus avoiding risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on avoiding risk and ensuring a 100% win does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B, whereas the individual's justification suggests a preference for Lottery A based on different criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Geldsumme von 1000 ist das höhere Risiko wert,"" which translates to ""An amount of money of 1000 is worth the higher risk."" This suggests the individual considered the potential gain and the risk involved but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies the individual is weighing the potential gain against the risk, suggesting a consideration of the trade-off between the amount of money and the risk level. However, the specific justification for choosing one lottery over the other based on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes is not clearly stated.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems to consider the risk and the potential gain but does not directly compare the outcome differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, as given, does not clearly align with this rule, as it discusses risk and potential gain without specifying how these factors were weighed against each other in terms of outcome differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly considered in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the importance of a ""sicherer Gewinn"" (safe win) at almost 90% probability, indicating they considered the high probability of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the certainty of a win at a high probability is more important than the sum or difference, which implies they prioritized the probability of winning over the potential monetary difference between the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the individual's decision-making process. Instead, the individual emphasizes the importance of a high probability of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (6000 Euros difference). However, the individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of a win, not the difference between outcomes, suggesting they did not follow the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates they prioritized the high probability of winning in Lottery A over the potential differences in outcomes between the two lotteries, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the low probability of winning and mentions taking a ""full risk"" with ""halved chances"" for a potentially higher gain. This suggests the individual is focusing on the potential upside (higher gain) and the comparative probabilities of achieving it, rather than explicitly discussing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's justification seems to lean towards the potential for a higher reward despite lower chances, rather than a detailed comparison of outcome ranges.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (potential upside and comparative probabilities), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual discusses the potential for a higher gain, which relates to the maximum outcomes of the lotteries, but does not explicitly mention the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification hints at preferring the higher potential gain (which aligns with Lottery B's higher maximum outcome), but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on the difference between outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""risikoreich"" which translates to ""risk-rich"" in English, indicating an awareness of risk. They also mention ""nur -1000 mehr bei falscher Entscheidung,"" which translates to ""only -1000 more with the wrong decision."" This implies the individual is considering the potential loss difference between the two lotteries, specifically a comparison involving a -1000 Euro difference.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to be weighing the risk and the potential additional loss of choosing one lottery over the other, focusing on the -1000 Euro difference as a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, while considering risk and a specific financial difference, does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual’s justification, however, seems to focus on the risk and the -1000 Euro difference, not explicitly on the maximum and minimum outcomes or their differences.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual does not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's consideration of risk and the -1000 Euro difference does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 - (-3000) = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 - (-4000) = 4000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""geringeres prozentuales Risiko"" which translates to ""lower percentage risk"", indicating the individual considered the probabilities of the losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests that the lower percentage risk outweighs the potential financial loss, implying the individual weighed the risk against the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the percentage risk and potential financial loss, not explicitly the difference between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is about weighing the lower percentage risk against the potential loss, not directly about comparing the outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason is about comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not reflected in the individual's verbal report. The individual's focus was on the percentage risk and potential loss, not on the differences between the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Riskoreich, aber gute prozentuale Verteilung,"" which translates to ""Risk-rich, but good percentage distribution."" This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect (possibly implying the magnitude of potential losses or the spread of outcomes) and the probability distribution of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but hints at a consideration of risk and probability, which might imply a comparison of the lotteries based on these aspects.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which can be related to the ""Riskoreich"" (risk-rich) part of the report, as it might imply consideration of the spread or range of outcomes. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which is Lottery A. The individual's justification is not clearly aligned with this rule, as the report does not explicitly state a preference based on the calculated differences between the outcomes of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's consideration of risk and probability distribution does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of comparing the outcome differences, which is central to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not clearly indicate the application of the specific rule regarding the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 - (-3000) = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 - (-6000) = 6000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""0,1 Prozent weniger Risko"" (0.1 percent less risk), which suggests they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. However, the translation of ""Summe bei B ist das 0,1 Prozent weniger Risko weniger nicht wert"" to English is roughly ""The sum at B is not worth the 0.1 percent less risk,"" indicating the individual weighed the potential outcomes against the risk (probability) but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk associated with the probability of winning (or not winning) rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The phrase implies a comparison based on risk rather than the specific outcomes' differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual's consideration seems to be more about the risk (probability) rather than the outcome differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention this rule; instead, it focuses on the perceived value of risk.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The verbal report suggests a focus on risk perception rather than the specific outcome differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 500 Euros (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""sicherer Gewinn ist besser als das Verlustrisiko,"" which translates to ""a certain gain is better than the risk of loss."" This indicates the individual considered the certainty of gain versus the risk of not gaining (or losing) in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's statement implies they value certainty over risk, suggesting a preference for avoiding potential loss over the potential for greater gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual seems to focus on the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss. These are not directly aligned, as the individual's consideration does not explicitly mention the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the value of a certain gain, which aligns more with the characteristics of Lottery B. This suggests the individual's decision-making process may not have followed the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the certainty of gain and the avoidance of loss risk, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""gleiches Risiko für 0"" which translates to ""same risk for 0"" and ""sichere Variante"" which translates to ""safe variant"". This suggests the individual considered the risk of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries and the aspect of safety or certainty in one of the options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk associated with getting 0 Euros and the concept of a safe option, but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -2000 Euros is not the maximum, we have -4000 and -2000 as the two lowest outcomes, and 0 Euros as the highest, so the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""weniger Risiko durch höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit bei 0"", which translates to ""less risk due to higher probability of 0"". This suggests the individual considered the risk associated with each lottery, specifically focusing on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to be based on minimizing risk, as indicated by the mention of ""weniger Risiko"" (less risk), and the consideration of the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, while the individual considered the risk and the probability of the 0 Euro outcome. These do not directly align, as the individual's focus was on risk and a specific outcome rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 6000 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on minimizing risk by considering the probability of the 0 Euro outcome, not on comparing the range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on risk and the probability of the 0 Euro outcome, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery.

The individual's mention of taking a risk ""with the difference"" suggests they might be leaning towards the option with the greater difference (Lottery A), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (99%) of no loss in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found the high probability of no loss to be very convincing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, but the individual focused on the high probability of no loss in Lottery A, not directly on the outcome differences. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of no loss, not the outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's focus on the probability of no loss and not on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries indicates that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sicherer Gewinn"", which translates to ""safe gain"" or ""certain win"", indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the aspect of certainty or safety, rather than explicitly comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's focus was on the certainty of the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification hints at preferring the certain gain, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A because it offers a certain, though smaller, gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's verbal report focuses on the certainty of the gain rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason in question. The decision reason specifically looks for the lottery with the larger difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which does not align with the individual's stated concern for a ""safe gain""."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sichere Variante für Geldgewinn,"" which translates to ""safe option for money gain."" This suggests the individual considered the aspect of safety or certainty in gaining money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The emphasis on ""sichere Variante"" implies the individual prioritized the certainty of gaining money over other potential factors.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's emphasis on the safety or certainty of the gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes safety, suggesting a preference for Lottery A due to its guaranteed positive outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's emphasis on the ""safe option for money gain"" and the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes do not align. The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its larger outcome difference, but the individual's justification suggests a preference for the safe, guaranteed gain of Lottery A, indicating the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 1000 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery A has a larger difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""sicherer Gewinn ohne Risiko,"" which translates to ""safe profit without risk."" This implies the individual considered the risk aspect and the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prioritize avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, as indicated by the emphasis on a ""safe profit.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk and safe profit.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes safety and no risk, which aligns more with choosing Lottery B because it offers a certain gain without any risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on avoiding risk and ensuring a safe profit, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. The decision reason would lead to choosing Lottery A due to its larger outcome difference, but the individual's justification suggests they prioritized the certainty of Lottery B. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same (0 Euros), so the difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, so the difference is 12000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""zu großes Risiko bei Lotterie B"", which translates to ""too much risk in Lottery B"". This indicates the individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived risk of Lottery B, implying that the risk was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is related to the concept of risk. However, the individual's consideration of ""risk"" is not explicitly about the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes but rather a general concern about the riskiness of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. In contrast, the individual's justification implies they were deterred by the risk of Lottery B, suggesting they did not prefer it due to its risk profile.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the risk of Lottery B and their decision based on this risk perception does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery B due to its larger outcome difference, which contradicts the individual's risk-averse stance. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
