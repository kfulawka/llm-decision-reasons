STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considers the guaranteed high amount in Lottery A, the potential for a slightly higher amount in Lottery B, and the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B. They also mention the minimal difference in the potential winnings and the certainty of winning with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the certainty of a high win with Lottery A, the minimal potential increase with Lottery B, and the risk associated with Lottery B. They emphasize the security of the outcome with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed amount in A, potential higher amount in B, risk of nothing in B, minimal difference in winnings, and certainty of winning with A). The individual's considerations include but are not limited to the maximum outcomes, focusing more on the certainty and risk aspects.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (emphasizing certainty and minimal difference in potential winnings). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they prioritize the certainty of the outcome over the maximum potential gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based more on the certainty of the outcome and the minimal difference in potential winnings, rather than solely on the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason, which prioritizes the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, was not the primary basis for their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 2500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries are almost equal in terms of the amounts that can be won and the chances of winning. They specifically mention that with Lottery B, one can win a bit more at almost the same chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice (though the choice itself is not explicitly stated) by comparing the potential winnings and the probabilities of the two lotteries, highlighting the slightly higher potential win in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (2400 Euros for A and 2500 Euros for B), which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the potential winnings from each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome, which is Lottery B with 2500 Euros. The individual’s justification also leans towards preferring Lottery B because it offers a slightly higher potential win, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on the maximum outcomes of the lotteries and the preference for the lottery offering the higher maximum outcome. This suggests that the individual likely used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B. This information is relevant because it directly pertains to the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery A, the high chance of winning with Lottery B, the difference in the amounts that can be won, and the risk of winning nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a certain win, even though the amount is lower, over the uncertainty of Lottery B, which has a higher potential win but also a risk of winning nothing. The individual seems to prioritize certainty over the potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for B and 3000 Euros for A), while the individual considers a broader range of factors including certainty, the magnitude of potential wins, and the risk of losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its higher maximum outcome, but the individual chooses Lottery A, emphasizing the importance of a guaranteed win over the potential for a higher payout. This suggests the individual did not prioritize the maximum outcome as the sole decision criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Instead, the individual's choice is driven by a preference for certainty and a guaranteed win, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. This information is relevant because it directly pertains to the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery results in a loss, the probability of winning is approximately equal, but Lottery A has a slightly lower chance of winning with a higher potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning and the amounts that can be won, noting the trade-off between the slightly lower probability of winning in Lottery A and its higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes (4000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), while the individual considers both the probabilities and the amounts that can be won, noting the trade-off between them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, balances the lower probability of winning in Lottery A against its higher potential gain, which aligns with considering the maximum outcome but also incorporates the probability of winning, not just the outcome itself.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's consideration of the maximum outcomes and their implicit preference for the higher gain (despite mentioning the lower probability of winning) suggest some alignment with the decision reason. However, the individual also considers the probabilities of winning, which is not a factor in the decision reason provided. This indicates that while the decision reason might have played a role, it was not the sole or possibly even primary reason for the individual's decision, as the verbal report suggests a more nuanced decision-making process. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with significant uncertainty due to the additional considerations mentioned by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B. This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes that neither lottery results in a loss, the potential gain from Lottery A is twice as high as from Lottery B, but the gain from A is much less probable than the gain from B. The individual also considers the gain from B to be very good and very probable. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to weigh the potential gain against its probability, acknowledging the trade-off between the higher potential gain of Lottery A and its lower probability, compared to the lower but more probable gain of Lottery B. However, the individual does not explicitly state which lottery is chosen based on this reasoning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the potential gains and their probabilities). The individual does consider the potential gains (maximum outcomes) but also heavily weighs the probabilities, which is not a part of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (considering both the potential gain and its probability). The individual’s justification does not solely focus on the maximum outcome but rather balances it with the probability of achieving that outcome. This suggests that while the individual is aware of the maximum outcomes, the decision-making process involves more than just comparing these outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, involves considering both the potential gain and its probability, rather than solely focusing on the maximum outcome of each lottery. This indicates that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome without considering probabilities, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum payout of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is that Lottery A offers a higher maximum payout than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning in both lotteries is very small but observes that if one does win, Lottery A pays out double the amount of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus is on the comparison of the payouts when winning, highlighting the doubling effect of Lottery A's payout compared to Lottery B's, without discussing the probabilities in depth.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome of each lottery, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the payout amounts and the observation that Lottery A pays double.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome, and the individual justifies their choice by highlighting the higher payout of Lottery A when a win occurs, which directly relates to the maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual considered the key aspect relevant to the decision reason (the maximum payout) and used a justification (the doubling of the payout in Lottery A) that aligns with the rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since there's a 20% chance of winning this amount). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are -3000 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain loss at Lottery A as very high and notes that the loss at Lottery B is even higher but also mentions the chance to lose nothing. This implies the individual is considering the potential losses and the existence of a zero-loss outcome in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by comparing the difference in loss amounts between the two lotteries and weighing it against the chance of not losing anything with Lottery B, indicating a consideration of risk and potential outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (-3000 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B), while the individual considers the certain loss and the chance of losing nothing, which aligns with the maximum outcomes but frames them in terms of loss and risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros for B), and the individual seems to be swayed by the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B, which can be interpreted as being influenced by the more favorable maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report suggests an awareness of the maximum outcomes (framed as the chance to lose nothing with Lottery B) and a justification that aligns with preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. While the report does not explicitly state the decision reason's rule, the consideration of the zero-loss possibility in Lottery B and its influence on the decision implies a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used. However, the framing in terms of loss and risk introduces some uncertainty, preventing a 100% certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. In this case, both lotteries have a maximum outcome of 0 Euros (no gain), but they differ in their potential losses. The relevant information for this reason is the maximum outcome (or in this case, the least negative outcome) of each lottery. Since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome (0 Euros), but the decision reason is about comparing these outcomes to determine preference, we need to see how the individual discusses the outcomes in relation to this rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain, and they compare the potential losses and their probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by considering the height of the potential loss and the probability of the loss, noting that while the probability of a loss is higher in Lottery B, it does not compensate for the higher loss amount in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome, but since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome (0 Euros), the individual's consideration of loss amounts can be seen as a way of comparing the lotteries based on their worst outcomes, given that the best outcome (0 Euros) is the same for both.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the potential losses and their probabilities, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's focus on outcomes, but the individual does not directly compare the maximum outcomes (0 Euros for both) as the decision reason would suggest. Instead, they discuss the potential losses, which could imply they are considering the ""less bad"" outcome, given that both lotteries offer no positive gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros and the individual focuses on the losses. However, the consideration of which loss is more favorable (in terms of amount and probability) could be seen as a related but distinct reasoning process. Thus, while there's a slight connection in the sense that the individual is evaluating the lotteries based on their outcomes, the decision reason as stated (focusing on the maximum outcome) does not directly apply to the individual's justification, which is more about comparing the negative aspects of each lottery."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of the least negative (or most favorable in the context of minimizing loss) is also 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are -3000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B as the most favorable outcomes. This indicates that the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high loss amount in both lotteries but notes that with Lottery A, there is a high probability of losing a significant amount, whereas with Lottery B, there's a chance to end up with 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential for avoiding loss (ending up with 0 Euros) in Lottery B as a significant factor, implying that the possibility of not losing (getting 0 Euros) is important.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual discusses the outcomes but emphasizes the aspect of avoiding loss and the probability of losing, which indirectly relates to the maximum outcome (0 Euros being more favorable than -3000 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (0 Euros for B over -3000 Euros for A). The individual's justification seems to align with preferring the lottery that offers a chance at the more favorable outcome (0 Euros), which suggests an alignment with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's thought process aligns with considering the maximum outcomes and preferring the lottery that offers a more favorable maximum outcome (in this case, 0 Euros over -3000 Euros), which is the basis of the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's -3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing in both lotteries to be approximately equally low and notes that the difference in probabilities does not make much of a difference. They also consider the amount lost in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the amount lost (mentioning ""Bei B verliert man jedoch weniger"" - At B, however, you lose less) and the similar low probabilities of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcome, which is the amount lost in the worst-case scenario for each lottery. The individual also considers the amount lost, which aligns with the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (less negative), and the individual's justification mentions losing less with Lottery B, indicating a preference for the lesser loss, which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's focus on the amount lost and their preference for the lottery with the lesser loss (Lottery B) directly aligns with the decision reason's consideration of the maximum outcome and preference for the more favorable one. This alignment indicates that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 500 Euros. This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome than Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the following information: 
- The certainty of the gain with Lottery B.
- The higher potential gain of Lottery A, but also the risk of receiving nothing.
The individual's justification for the choice seems to weigh the certainty of a gain against the potential for a higher gain and the risk of no gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual does mention the higher potential gain of Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes. However, the individual also considers the certainty of the gain with Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, which is not directly part of the decision reason's rule. 
Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual's justification, the individual seems to prioritize the certainty of the gain over the potential for a higher maximum outcome, which does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual does consider the maximum outcome of the lotteries, their final justification for the choice is more influenced by the certainty of the gain and the risk of no gain, rather than solely the maximum outcome as the decision reason dictates."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the best possible outcome, which is not losing any money), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros (since this is the only outcome and it involves losing money). The information relevant to the decision reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery: 0 Euros for A and -500 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of each lottery, noting that Lottery A has a potential loss twice as high as Lottery B but also offers a 50/50 chance of not losing any money. For Lottery B, the individual notes the loss is certain and ""recht hoch"" (quite high).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential losses against the chance of no loss in Lottery A, indicating a consideration of both the magnitude of potential losses and the certainty of loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (0 Euros for A and -500 Euros for B), while the individual discusses the potential losses and the chance of not losing. The individual's consideration indirectly touches upon the maximum outcomes by mentioning the chance of not losing in Lottery A, which aligns with the concept of a more favorable maximum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual seems to prefer Lottery A because it offers a chance of not losing, which can be seen as focusing on the more favorable aspect of the maximum outcome (not losing anything).

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process aligns with considering the maximum outcomes indirectly by focusing on the chance of not losing in Lottery A, which is the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome according to the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made solely based on the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, while there's an alignment, it's not a perfect match, suggesting some uncertainty in the assessment.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has the more favorable maximum outcome of 6000 Euros compared to Lottery A's maximum outcome of 4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the amounts won and their probabilities, noting that the amounts in Lottery A are somewhat lower but more probable, and that Lottery A offers a middle ground (2000 Euros) which is seen as a reduction of the high risk of getting nothing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because, despite the lower maximum amount, the wins are more probable and there's a middle outcome that mitigates the risk of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for B and 4000 Euros for A), but the individual considers not just the maximum amounts, but also the probabilities of winning and the presence of a middle outcome in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome, which is Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the probability of winning and the risk mitigation provided by the middle outcome in Lottery A, rather than solely focusing on the maximum possible win.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's consideration of probabilities and the mitigation of risk by the middle outcome in Lottery A, rather than a focus on the maximum possible win, suggests that the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) was not used by the individual to make the decision."
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since there is no positive gain, but rather losses or no loss), and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same maximum outcome of 0 Euros, as there are no positive outcomes in either lottery, only losses or no loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain and compares the loss amounts and their probabilities between the two lotteries. Specifically, they mention the higher loss amount in Lottery B but also note its lower probability, and they acknowledge the high loss amounts in Lottery A and their relative probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the magnitude of potential losses against their probabilities, suggesting a consideration of both the amount of loss and its likelihood in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcome of each lottery. In contrast, the individual considers the magnitude of losses and their probabilities, not just the maximum outcome (which, in this case, is the same for both lotteries since it's 0 Euros for both).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is to prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Since both lotteries have the same maximum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification involves comparing loss amounts and their probabilities, which goes beyond simply considering the maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's deliberation process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on the comparison of loss amounts and their probabilities rather than the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the maximum outcome and the individual's justification does not align with this rule, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a more favorable maximum outcome (5000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the small chance of winning something in Lottery A and notes that the gain in Lottery B is very small. They also mention that receiving nothing (in the case of Lottery A's 99.9% probability of 0 Euros) makes no big difference.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential for any gain against the certainty of a small gain, acknowledging the low probability of winning in Lottery A but also considering the minimal reward of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual discusses the outcomes but also considers the probabilities and the psychological impact of receiving nothing versus a small guaranteed amount.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would choose based on the maximum possible win, which is Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems to balance the potential for a significant win against the certainty of a small win and the psychological aspect of possibly receiving nothing, which does not directly align with the decision reason's sole focus on maximum outcomes.

The individual's deliberation process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum outcome of each lottery. While the individual does consider the outcomes, their justification incorporates additional factors such as the probability of winning and the psychological impact of the outcomes, which are not part of the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. In Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros (a loss), and in Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (no gain or loss, but the possibility of a significant loss). Since we can derive the maximum outcomes from the given lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

Relevant information for the decision reason:
- Maximum outcome of Lottery A: -5 Euros
- Maximum outcome of Lottery B: 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
- The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain.
- They recognize a small loss in Lottery A.
- They acknowledge a very low chance but potentially very high loss in Lottery B.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The individual prefers to accept a small, certain loss (in Lottery A) over the risk of a much larger loss (in Lottery B), despite the low probability of the larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
- The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes, which are -5 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.
- The individual considers the losses associated with each lottery but does not explicitly compare the maximum outcomes in the context of choosing the more favorable one based solely on those outcomes.

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
- The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because its maximum outcome (0 Euros) is more favorable than Lottery A's (-5 Euros).
- The individual, however, chooses Lottery A based on preferring a small, certain loss over a potentially larger loss with a low probability, not explicitly because of the maximum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning aligns more with risk aversion or minimizing potential losses rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule of choosing based on the maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros. This information can be derived directly from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the certainty of winning with Lottery A (""Bei A gewinnt man auf jeden Fall und nicht wenig"") and the risk of losing with Lottery B (""Bei B gibt es zu 50% die Chance, viel zu verlieren""). The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the risk associated with Lottery B and the guaranteed win of Lottery A. The described deliberation process emphasizes the avoidance of risk and the appeal of a certain gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, it's clear the individual did not directly compare the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason would suggest. Instead, they focused on the risk and certainty aspects. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B with a maximum outcome of 3000 Euros. However, the individual's justification for their choice does not align with this rule, as they prioritize the guaranteed win over the potential for a higher maximum outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries: 2000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the certain gain of Lottery A as very high and notes that Lottery B's potential gain is higher but only with 50% certainty. They also mention the risk of losing a significant amount with the same probability in Lottery B. The individual's justification for their choice seems to focus on the trade-off between the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and the higher but uncertain gain in Lottery B, along with the risk of loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of 2000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual does discuss the higher potential gain of Lottery B but also emphasizes the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and the risk of loss in B. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the certainty of the gain over the maximum potential gain, suggesting a more nuanced consideration than the decision reason alone. The individual does not strictly follow the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome due to concerns over certainty and risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision, as the verbal report suggests considerations beyond just the maximum outcomes, such as certainty and risk."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum outcome of each lottery: 3000 Euros for A and 1000 Euros for B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed win of Lottery B, the higher potential win of Lottery A, and the risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the guarantee of winning with Lottery B, comparing it to the higher but risky outcome of Lottery A, and concludes that the risk of losing with A is too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual discusses the outcomes but focuses more on the guarantee and risk rather than explicitly comparing the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification, we observe that the individual does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum outcome alone but rather weighs the guarantee against the risk and potential higher gain.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the guarantee of winning and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than solely comparing the maximum possible wins of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a more favorable maximum outcome (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of Lottery A, which is -6000 Euros, and notes that it is very high and risky. They also mention that with Lottery B, one wins nothing but also loses nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be focusing on the risk of loss associated with Lottery A and the certainty of no loss with Lottery B, rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum outcomes (6000 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B), but the individual discusses the risk of loss and the certainty of no loss with B, not directly mentioning the maximum outcomes as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize avoiding loss over achieving the highest possible gain, which aligns more with risk aversion than with maximizing the maximum outcome.
