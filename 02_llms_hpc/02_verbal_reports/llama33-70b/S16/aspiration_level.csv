STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. To calculate the aspiration level, we need to consider all unique outcomes from both lotteries: 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery B, the differences are (2500 - 1633.33), (2400 - 1633.33), and (0 - 1633.33). For Lottery A, the difference is (2400 - 1633.33). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report provided is ""Siehe wie vorher beschrieben. Wissen ist einfach mehr."" This translates to ""See as previously described. Knowledge is simply more."" The report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level, the calculation of differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, or the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual’s justification for the choice is not clearly related to the decision reason. The information considered by the individual is also not explicitly stated in relation to the decision problem's specifics (outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and the aspiration level, preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual, there is no clear indication that the individual considered these aspects. The verbal report lacks specific details about the deliberation process related to the decision reason. Comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice, there is no explicit mention of the rule or its components in the verbal report. Therefore, based on these comparisons, it appears unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275 Euros) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros), while Lottery B has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175 Euros) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference in probabilities (""1% mehr"") between the two lotteries, indicating they considered the probabilities of winning.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by mentioning that the slightly higher probability (""1% mehr"") could lead to a win, implying they focused on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the slight difference in probabilities of winning without mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its slightly higher probability of winning (and thus a positive difference). The individual's justification aligns with choosing the lottery with a higher probability of winning but does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration levels or positive differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual seems to have considered the probability of winning, which aligns with part of the decision reason's rule but does not fully capture the essence of the reason, which involves an aspiration level and the concept of positive differences from this level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there is some alignment in the consideration of probabilities, the core aspects of the decision reason (aspiration level and preference for the higher probability of positive differences) are not clearly reflected in the individual's verbal report, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% probability of a positive difference (666.67 Euros) and Lottery B has an 80% probability of a positive difference (1666.67 Euros) and a 20% probability of a negative difference (-2333.33 Euros), the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring to know exactly what they will get (100% certainty) rather than not knowing and potentially losing. This implies the individual values certainty and is averse to the risk of losing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the preference for certainty and avoiding potential loss, rather than directly comparing the outcomes or their differences from an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the outcome and the avoidance of potential loss, not explicitly mentioning aspiration levels or the comparison of positive differences. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual prefers the lottery that offers certainty, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly reflect the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the preference for certainty could indirectly relate to preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive, but this is not explicitly tied to an aspiration level or the specific calculation involved in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there is a slight alignment in preferring positive outcomes, the individual's justification does not directly match the decision reason's specific rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it's 25% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability (25%) of outcomes above the aspiration level compared to Lottery A (20%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""B sah einfach besser von der Wahrscheinlichkeit aus,"" which translates to ""B simply looked better in terms of probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries when making their decision. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its probability, but the report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from this level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (probabilities), there's a partial match. The individual considered probabilities, which aligns with part of the decision reason's process but doesn't directly address the aspiration level or the specific comparison of outcome differences from this level. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) is somewhat aligned with the individual's justification (B looked better in terms of probability), but the report lacks explicit mention of the aspiration level calculation or comparison, which is central to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on probability aligns somewhat with the decision reason's consideration of the probability of positive differences, but the lack of explicit mention of the aspiration level and the comparison of outcome differences in the verbal report suggests that the decision reason was not directly used as described. The assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used (0) than to uncertainty (50) or certainty that it was used (100), but there's a slight inclination towards considering probabilities, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 90% (since 3000 Euros is above the aspiration level with 90% probability), and in Lottery B, it's 45% (since 6000 Euros is above the aspiration level with 45% probability). Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, finding the probability of Lottery A more attractive than that of Lottery B, specifically mentioning that the probabilities in Lottery B were too close together.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of the probabilities, particularly the comparison between the two lotteries' probability distributions.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, discusses the attractiveness of probabilities without mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of outcomes above the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification focuses on the general attractiveness of the probabilities without referencing an aspiration level or the specific rule about positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the concept of preferring the lottery based on the probability of outcomes being above this level. The focus on the attractiveness of probabilities and their comparative closeness does not align with the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2250 = 750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros; for Lottery B, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 Euros and 0 - 2250 = -2250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0.2% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it is 0.1% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A based on the calculated probabilities of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeit"") was better for one of the lotteries, even though the difference was only 0.1%. This implies the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the probability being ""besser angelegt"" (better laid out or more favorable), indicating a focus on the probability aspect but without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the specific calculation of differences from an aspiration level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probability, which is a part of the decision reason but does not directly address the aspiration level or the comparison of differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on a general preference for the better probability without specifying how this probability is evaluated in terms of outcomes and aspiration levels.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus on probability aligns partially with the decision reason, but the specific application of the aspiration level and the comparison of differences from this level, as required by the decision reason, are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, there is no clear indication that the aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level was used in the decision-making process. The verbal report lacks direct references to these key elements of the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + (-4000) + 0) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B offers a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) and a 80% chance of a negative difference (-4000 Euros outcome), while Lottery A offers a 0% chance of a positive difference (-3000 Euros outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing with both lotteries but noted that Lottery B offers a small chance of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by mentioning the value of attempting to avoid loss, even with a small chance, which is worth the try.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing with Lottery B, which aligns with the concept of positive differences from the aspiration level in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences, and the individual's justification hints at valuing the small chance of avoiding loss (a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level), suggesting alignment with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the chance to avoid loss and the justification that this chance is worth the attempt suggests a strong alignment with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. However, the verbal report does not explicitly calculate or mention the aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences, which introduces some uncertainty. Thus, while there's a clear inclination towards using the decision reason, it's not a perfect match."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus the mean of -4000, 0, -3000, and 0, which equals (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -3500 / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are considered important. For Lottery B, the differences are -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750. For Lottery A, the differences are -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have one outcome that results in a positive difference (0 Euros) and one that results in a negative difference. The probability of the positive difference in Lottery B is 80%, and in Lottery A, it is 75%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B due to its higher probability (80%) of a positive difference compared to Lottery A (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions relying on the 80% probability, which implies they considered the probability of not getting anything (0 Euros) in one of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual wanted to rely on the 80% chance of getting nothing, which suggests they were focused on avoiding a loss rather than considering the aspiration level or differences from it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, seems to focus on the probability of not getting anything, which aligns with avoiding a loss but does not directly indicate consideration of an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 80% chance of a positive difference (in the context of avoiding a loss, this translates to not losing). The individual’s justification also leads them to prefer the lottery with the 80% chance of not losing, which aligns with the outcome but not necessarily the reasoning process involving an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's focus on the 80% probability and desire to avoid loss aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not clearly indicate that they used the specific decision reason involving an aspiration level and the rule of preferring the higher probability of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros, 0 Euros, -6000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-3000 + 0 + -6000) / 3 = -3000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -3000 Euros, the difference is 0; for 0 Euros, the difference is 3000; for -6000 Euros, the difference is -3000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive difference is 3000 (when the outcome is 0 Euros), we need to calculate the probability of getting 0 Euros in each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of getting 0 Euros is 10%, and for Lottery B, it is 55%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of losing in Lottery A, indicating they considered the probability of the negative outcome (-3000 Euros) in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that the probability of losing in Lottery A was too high, which implies they were concerned about the risk of the negative outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the probability of losing in Lottery A, which does not directly relate to the concept of aspiration level or positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher probability (55%) of resulting in 0 Euros, a positive difference from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on the probability of losing being too high in Lottery A, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of losing in Lottery A and their concern about this probability being too high does not align with the decision reason's criteria of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we proceed step by step.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. This is the aspiration level. The reason then considers the differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level: for Lottery A, the differences are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, the differences are -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have a positive difference of 2250 with the same probability (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B, which is a difference but in the context of the reason, we're focusing on the presence of positive outcomes), but Lottery A has a slightly higher probability of a positive difference, we must consider how the individual's verbal report aligns with this reasoning.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's report mentions that money was the primary concern and highlights the difference in potential losses between Lotteries A and B, specifically noting that Lottery B could result in a loss of 3000 Euros instead of the 6000 Euros in Lottery A. The individual seems to focus on the magnitude of potential losses rather than the probabilities of positive outcomes or the concept of aspiration levels directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of potential losses), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual's justification for the choice (focusing on the magnitude of potential losses) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level). The individual does not mention calculating an aspiration level or considering probabilities of positive differences, which are central to the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0 (no difference). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of getting money in both lotteries, specifically that Lottery A has a 50% chance of getting money or nothing, and Lottery B has a 100% chance of getting something.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a 100% chance of getting something, implying a preference for a guaranteed outcome over a risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not mention calculating an aspiration level or explicitly considering positive differences from such a level. Instead, the individual focuses on the probability of getting money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the preference for a guaranteed outcome, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason was not used by the individual, as there is no mention or implication of calculating an aspiration level or considering the probability of positive differences from this level in the verbal report. The individual's decision-making process, as described, focuses on the certainty of getting money, which does not align with the specifics of the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (500 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference (0 Euros), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the potential loss of 500 Euros (from Lottery B) to the potential loss of 1000 Euros (from Lottery A), indicating they considered the outcomes of both lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual finds it more attractive to lose 500 Euros for sure rather than possibly losing 1000 Euros, suggesting a preference for avoiding the larger potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (outcomes of both lotteries). While the individual considered the outcomes, there's no direct mention of calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring to avoid the larger loss). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the probability of positive differences or an aspiration level but does indicate a preference that aligns with avoiding downside risk, which indirectly could relate to the decision reason if the aspiration level's role was to highlight the downside risk in Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described does not directly align with the specific steps of the decision reason (calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences). However, the individual's focus on avoiding a larger loss could be seen as tangentially related to the concept of preferring outcomes based on their deviation from a reference point (like an aspiration level), but this is a stretch without explicit mention of these concepts.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as specifically defined, was used by the individual, given the lack of direct reference to an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences in the verbal report. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's risk aversion and focus on avoiding larger losses could be seen as vaguely related to the general idea of preferring certain outcomes based on their potential for positive deviations from a reference point."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery A, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason considers the probability of positive differences. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level) and there's also a 25% chance of no difference (2000 Euros outcome), but this is not considered positive. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the last two outcomes of Lottery A together make up 50% of the probability where one could win something. This indicates the individual is considering the probabilities of winning in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the combined probability of the last two outcomes of Lottery A, which both offer a win, but does not explicitly compare this to the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of outcomes above this level. The individual discusses the probability of winning in Lottery A but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual’s justification focuses on the probability of winning something in Lottery A but does not explicitly discuss preferring based on positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's specific process of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus is more on the general probability of winning in one of the lotteries rather than on the specific rule of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probabilities of losing in Lottery B (25% for each of the two possible losses) and calculates the combined probability of losing (50%). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states that the risk of losing in Lottery B was too high at the moment of the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing in Lottery B). The individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the risk of losing being too high). The individual’s justification does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, as it focuses on the risk of losing rather than the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as described by the decision reason. The focus on the risk of losing in Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's specific criteria for preferring one lottery over the other. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 = 1668.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, (5000 - 1668.33) and (0 - 1668.33), and for Lottery B, (5 - 1668.33). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is higher than the certain outcome of Lottery B and one of the outcomes of Lottery A, and given the probabilities, we can proceed to assess how this applies to the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B (""zu 100% sicherer als bei A""), indicating they looked at the probability aspect, specifically the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the certainty of the outcomes, mentioning that despite the low amount in Lottery B, it was 100% certain, unlike Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B without explicitly mentioning calculations or comparisons involving an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome, which indirectly relates to the probability aspect but does not directly address the concept of an aspiration level or the comparison of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and lack of mention of an aspiration level or comparison of outcomes to such a level suggest that the decision reason, as described, was not used by the individual. The verbal report indicates a simpler decision-making process based on the guarantee of an outcome rather than a complex calculation involving aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B and the potential for a much larger loss in Lottery A, despite its low probability. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""sicheren Seite"" (safe side) of Lottery B due to their perceived bad luck, implying a risk-averse attitude towards the potential large loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention such calculations or considerations. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of the loss in Lottery B and the risk of a large loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on avoiding a large potential loss due to perceived bad luck, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The focus on risk aversion and perceived luck does not align with the specific rule of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery A, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level and the differences can be calculated, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of getting 1500 Euros (Lottery A) versus the uncertainty of getting either 3000 Euros or nothing (Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certain gain of 1500 Euros over the uncertain outcome of Lottery B, indicating a preference for avoiding uncertainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the uncertainty in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual's justification is based on preferring certainty over uncertainty, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on a preference for certainty, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the aspiration level or the differences from it, which are central to the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33, -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67, and 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to focus on the certainty of winning in Lottery A (""Safe gewinnt"") and compares it to the potential loss or lower gain in Lottery B, implying a consideration of the outcomes but not explicitly discussing probabilities or the concept of aspiration levels.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it provides a certain win, even if it's 1000 Euros less, which they find preferable to the uncertainty of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention these calculations or considerations, instead focusing on the certainty of a win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the certain win of Lottery A over the uncertainty of Lottery B, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since the aspiration level and differences are not mentioned.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from this level as a basis for their decision.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 - 3000 + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 333.33 ≈ 2666.67 Euros and -3000 - 333.33 ≈ -3333.33 Euros; for Lottery B, 1000 - 333.33 ≈ 666.67 Euros. The decision reason considers these differences and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery B, mentioning ""100% Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (100% probability) and the idea of ""safety"" associated with winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice of Lottery B by emphasizing the certainty of winning, implying that this aspect is crucial for their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. In contrast, the individual's focus is on the certainty of winning with Lottery B, without explicit mention of calculating aspiration levels or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, centers on the guarantee of a positive outcome with Lottery B, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the significant difference between the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences, and the individual's emphasis on the certainty of winning without any mention of these aspects. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, indicating that the decision reason was not used in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 - 0 = 6000 for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -6000 - 0 = -6000 for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 0 - 0 = 0 for Lottery A. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference (since its outcome is 0 Euros, which is the aspiration level). Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""50/50 Chancen"" (50/50 chances), indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes in Lottery B. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states ""sehe ich mich irgendwie nicht so Risiko bereit"" (I don't see myself as willing to take the risk somehow), which suggests they were concerned about the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual does consider the probabilities (50/50 chances), which is a relevant aspect. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual's justification focuses on risk aversion rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of positive differences. The individual's concern about risk aligns with preferring a lottery with no risk of loss (Lottery A) over one with a 50% chance of significant loss (Lottery B), but this does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a concern for risk, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's focus on positive outcomes, but the report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the concern for risk, the decision reason's specific criteria are not clearly reflected in the individual's justification, leading to a low assessment score."
