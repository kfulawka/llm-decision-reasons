STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 100%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, so the difference is 65%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning with each lottery, noting that Lottery B had a higher chance of winning compared to Lottery A, with only a 1% risk of winning 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the risk of not winning (0 Euros) was minimal (1%) and thus acceptable compared to the guaranteed but lower reward of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discussed the probabilities and the minimal risk but did not compare the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (difference of 0%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the minimal risk and higher chance of winning as reasons, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the perceived higher chance of winning and the minimal risk associated with Lottery B. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 33% and the minimum is 0% (implied by the 67% chance of 0 Euros), giving a difference of 33%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 34% and the minimum is 0% (implied by the 66% chance of 0 Euros), giving a difference of 34%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences between the outcomes of each lottery, which are 33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the comparison of all possibilities, recognizing the similarity in distribution between Lotteries A and B, and focusing on the probability of winning being approximately 1/3 for both, with Lottery B having a slightly higher probability of winning (by 1%). Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its slightly higher winning probability compared to Lottery A, despite the small difference in potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (comparing probabilities and recognizing the slight difference in winning chances), it appears the individual focused more on the winning probabilities rather than the range of probabilities (difference between max and min probabilities). Second, the decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (33% difference vs. 34% difference for Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery B based on its slightly higher winning probability, not the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason emphasizes the difference between the maximum and minimum probabilities of the lotteries, which would lead to a preference for Lottery A, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (the slightly higher probability of winning). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 60% difference (80% - 20%)
- Lottery B: 0% difference (100% - 100%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the potential gain of Lottery A with an 80% probability and compared it to the guaranteed gain of Lottery B, noting that the gain in B is 1000 Euros less than in A but is guaranteed at 100%. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to weigh the higher potential gain of Lottery A against the certainty of the gain in Lottery B, considering the trade-off between the amount and the probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the trade-off between the probability and the amount of the gain, not directly addressing the probability differences as the decision reason does. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (0% difference). The individual's justification, while not directly referencing the probability differences, implies a consideration of the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B as a significant factor, aligning with the preference for the lottery with no probability difference (Lottery B). 
Based on these comparisons, while the individual's reasoning does not directly mirror the decision reason's focus on probability differences, the emphasis on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B suggests an alignment with the outcome the decision reason would prefer (Lottery B), but the process described does not explicitly follow the decision reason’s rule.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 20%, resulting in a difference of 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the potential gain of each lottery and the associated probabilities. Specifically, they noted that Lottery A offers a higher gain but with a lower probability compared to Lottery B. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the fact that the probability of winning with Lottery B is 5% higher than with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (the absolute probabilities and the difference in potential gains), it appears the individual focused more on the absolute probabilities and the difference in potential gains rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The decision reason would have preferred Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (20%) compared to Lottery B (25%), but the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (the absolute probability of winning being higher).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (or 3000 Euros outcome), making the difference 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 45% (or 6000 Euros outcome), making the difference 45%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared both options, noting the lower potential gain of Lottery A compared to Lottery B but also considered the higher probability of winning in Lottery A (90%) over Lottery B (45%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite its lower potential gain, its higher probability of winning (90%) was more attractive, leading to a ""risikoärmere Wahl"" (less risky choice).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual did consider probabilities, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the attractiveness of the higher probability of winning in Lottery A, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus was on the absolute probabilities rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Thus, while the individual considered probabilities, the specific rule of the decision reason (preference based on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) does not seem to directly influence the choice as described in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (99.8% for A and 99.6% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries and the higher potential gain in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by noting the higher potential gain, despite the lower probability of winning, reasoning that since the outcome of 0 Euros is expected, the risk can be taken for the higher potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was on the low probability of winning and the potential gain, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference vs. 99.8% for A). In contrast, the individual chose Lottery A based on its higher potential gain despite the lower probability, not based on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the potential gain and the low probability of winning, rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% (since there is only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery: 60% for A and 0% for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss difference between A and B (1000 Euros), the possibility of ending up with 0 Euros and 20% probability in Lottery A, and the 100% loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose A despite the higher potential loss because of the 20% chance of ending up with 0 Euros, which is not available in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's considerations, as described, focus more on the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probability (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing the chance of avoiding loss as the reason, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report indicates the decision was based on the potential to avoid loss with a certain probability, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for -3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the gains and losses of both options and noted that both had high probabilities of loss (20% and 25%). They considered the probability of loss and the amount of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of loss was lower (20% compared to 25%), despite the higher loss amount if the loss occurred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery (60% for A and 50% for B), but the individual's consideration was on the probability of loss and the amount of loss, not directly on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery B with a 50% difference), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the lower probability of loss, not the difference in probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, which considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the probability of loss and the amount of potential loss, not on the range of probabilities.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 10% and 90%, resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 80%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 10%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning or losing in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 10% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A and the 55% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the magnitude of the loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential loss, the probability of getting 0 Euros was at least half, which seemed more favorable compared to the 10% chance in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is 80% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discussed the specific probabilities and the comparative risks but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B, but their justification was based on the comparative risks and the higher probability of avoiding loss, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the basis for their decision. The justification provided focuses on the comparative risks and probabilities rather than the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a coincidence in the choice, the reasoning process described does not clearly align with the decision reason."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (considering the outcome of -3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of both lotteries and the potential loss of -6000 Euros in Lottery A, which deterred them. They also acknowledged the higher probability of losing -3000 Euros in Lottery B compared to losing -6000 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the potential loss in Lottery A (-6000 Euros) was more deterrent, despite recognizing the slightly higher probability of a loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the individual's decision-making process. The individual focused more on the absolute outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.6% difference) over Lottery A (99.8% difference). However, the individual's justification does not mention the comparison of probability ranges but rather the deterrent effect of the potential losses and their respective probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The report indicates the decision was based on the perceived deterrent effect of potential losses and their probabilities, not on the comparison of probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in possible winnings between Lotteries A and B (500 Euros vs. 1000 Euros) and the risk associated with the 50% probability of winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the difference in possible winnings was not high enough to take a 50% risk, opting for the certain 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the difference in winnings and the risk, not explicitly on the probability differences between the lotteries as the decision reason does. However, the concern about risk implicitly touches upon the concept of probability.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 0% difference. The individual's justification, while not explicitly mentioning probability differences, does imply a preference for the certain outcome over the risky one, aligning with preferring the lottery (A) that has no variability in outcome probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. However, the concern about risk and the preference for a certain outcome over a risky one aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason. This suggests that while the individual may not have explicitly used the decision reason as stated, their thought process led to a decision that coincidentally matches what the decision reason would recommend. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint but not at certainty, reflecting some alignment but not a direct match."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (for the outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), but since the reason likely refers to the probabilities of the outcomes given, we consider the probabilities of the actual outcomes which are 50% for both, thus the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, interpreting the reason strictly as it's written, Lottery A has a difference of 0% and Lottery B, if considering the presence of a 0% chance implicitly for the non-mentioned outcome of not losing (which isn't directly applicable), still, the direct interpretation gives us 0% difference for A and could be misunderstood for B. The correct understanding should focus on the probabilities provided: both lotteries, under a strict interpretation, do not have a range of probabilities (0% to 100% for B if considering the implication of ""no loss"" as an outcome, but directly it's 50% for both outcomes), thus both have a 0% difference when considering the explicit probabilities given. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities associated with each lottery's outcomes and their differences, which are 0% for both lotteries under the correct interpretation of the provided probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not having a loss with Lottery B, the risk associated with the 50/50 probability, and the presence of a bonus.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance of no loss, despite acknowledging the high risk, and was willing to take this risk due to the potential of not losing any money and the influence of a bonus.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which, as interpreted, is 0% for both. The individual, however, focused on the possibility of no loss and the risk associated with Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on the correct interpretation. The individual's justification, however, is based on the potential for no loss and the impact of a bonus, not on the comparison of probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the potential outcomes and the bonus, rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for both 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), so the difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for 6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), so the difference is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the number of possibilities to win and the associated probabilities, comparing Lottery A and Lottery B in terms of the perceived safety (sicherere Variante) of the options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that Lottery A offered more possibilities to win than Lottery B, with a lower risk of getting nothing (0 Euros), implying a consideration of both the outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered the number of winning possibilities and the associated risks, which indirectly touches upon the concept of probability differences but does not explicitly mention comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (25% difference). The individual chose Lottery A, citing its ""safety"" and more possibilities to win, which aligns with preferring a lottery that might be seen as having a more balanced probability distribution, but does not directly mention the specific rule of comparing probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the basis for the decision. The justification provided focuses more on the perceived safety and number of winning possibilities rather than the specific calculation of probability differences. Thus, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual.

For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the -6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for both the -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros outcomes) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all possible outcomes and focused on the potential loss and its magnitude in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B has a higher potential loss despite a lower probability of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the potential loss and aiming to minimize the magnitude of the loss, indicating a preference for a lower potential loss even if it means accepting a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the magnitude of potential losses. However, the individual does consider the probability of loss (mentioning ""25% chance of loss"" for B), but the primary concern is the magnitude of the loss rather than the probability difference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 25% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on minimizing the magnitude of potential loss, which also leads to a preference for Lottery A but for different reasons. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. While the individual does choose Lottery A, the justification provided is based on minimizing the magnitude of potential loss rather than comparing probability differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 99.8%.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the high probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B (99.9%) and the low probability of winning 5000 Euros. They also consider the certainty of winning 5 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual prefers the certain outcome of 5 Euros over the high risk of getting 0 Euros, indicating they value certainty over the potential for a higher reward that is very unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, but the individual's consideration is more about the comparison of outcomes and their probabilities between the two lotteries, rather than the internal probability differences within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring a certain outcome over a highly uncertain one, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus is on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the high risk of getting nothing in Lottery B, rather than the internal probability differences of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B, the extremely low probability of a large loss in Lottery A, and the high likelihood of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the certain but small loss in Lottery B against the highly unlikely but large loss in Lottery A, ultimately being deterred by the potential for a large loss despite its low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused more on the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived risk of the large loss in Lottery A and the certainty of the small loss in Lottery B, not directly on the range of probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process did not explicitly involve calculating or considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the primary reason for their choice. However, the individual did choose Lottery B, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was the basis for the choice, suggesting that while the outcome aligns with the decision reason, the thought process described does not directly reflect the application of this reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains and losses of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A offers half the potential gain of Lottery B but with certainty, while Lottery B offers both a gain and a loss, each with 50% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to the uncertain outcome of Lottery B, which includes the risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration, as described, focuses more on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A versus the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than explicitly discussing the difference in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, preferred Lottery A due to its certainty, not explicitly because of the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the probability differences. The individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of gain over the risk of loss and gain, which is a different consideration than the probability range difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential higher gain of Lottery A but also thought about a previous round where they likely lost money. They focused on the certainty of winning with Lottery B, despite the lower potential gain compared to Lottery A if they were to win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by wanting to take the ""sicheren Weg"" (safe way) due to the 100% chance of winning with Lottery B, implying a preference for certainty over potential higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the individual's considerations, as described in the verbal report, do not mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries. Instead, they focus on the certainty of winning and past experiences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries in this case since both have a difference of 0%. The individual's justification, however, is based on the desire for certainty and past experiences, not on comparing the probability ranges of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The verbal report indicates that the decision was based on the desire for certainty and past experiences, not on the specific probability differences that the decision reason considers. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: difference = 0%
- Lottery B: difference = 0%
Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries according to its rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, mentioning that a 50% chance of winning or losing is too high, even though the potential gain is three times higher than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk associated with Lottery B is too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, but did not explicitly mention the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the key factor in the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason’s rule would lead to indifference between the two lotteries, whereas the individual's justification is based on the risk associated with Lottery B, which implies a preference for Lottery A due to its certainty, not because of the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be based on the perceived risk of Lottery B. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probability are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is also 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as: both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning or losing in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the risk of losing -6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it has no risk of loss or gain, implying that the risk associated with Lottery B was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0% for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was centered around the risk of loss and gain rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would lead to indifference. The individual, however, chose Lottery A specifically because it offered no risk, not because of the probability differences.
