STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, there is only one probability, 100%, so the difference is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 65%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the number of options in each lottery, starting with Lottery B, then examined the sums and probabilities of Lottery A to assess if the 1% risk of losing is worth the potential gain. Specifically, they focused on the potential gain of 100 Euros more in Lottery A and the risk of getting nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential gain of 100 Euros against the risk of losing, concluding that the risk was not worth the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the potential gains and the specific risk of losing, rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges but rather focuses on the trade-off between potential gain and risk. The individual's choice aligns with preferring Lottery B but for reasons not explicitly related to the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The focus was more on the risk and potential gain rather than the probability ranges, suggesting that while the outcome might align with the decision reason, the reasoning process itself does not directly reflect the application of this specific decision rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 33%, so the difference is 33% - 0% = 33%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 34%, so the difference is 34% - 0% = 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (33%) compared to Lottery B (34%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the similarity between the two lotteries, the difference in winnings, and the difference in probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because it offers 100 Euros more at only 1% lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the difference in probabilities but in the context of the difference in winnings, not the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the trade-off between the increase in winnings and the slight decrease in probability, not the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on a different aspect (the trade-off between winnings and probability), indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning with Lottery A and the higher potential winnings of Lottery B, along with its higher risk of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the certainty of winning outweighed the potential for higher winnings in Lottery B, especially considering the risk of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, which indirectly touches upon the probability aspects but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (0% difference). The individual preferred Lottery A due to its certainty, which aligns with preferring a situation with no risk (or a smaller difference in probabilities), but the justification does not explicitly mention comparing probability differences as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), and there's an implicit consideration of risk that could relate to the probability differences. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's some alignment, it's not a perfect match, leading to an assessment that is more than uncertain (50) but not completely certain (100) that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (maximum) and 0% is not present but implied as the minimum for the unwon state, and for Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% (maximum) and 0% (minimum) for the unwon state. However, the actual minimum probability in the context of the decision reason seems to refer to the lowest probability of winning, which for both lotteries is 0% (since the other outcomes are 0 Euros with a certain probability). The difference for Lottery A is 25% - 0% = 25%, and for Lottery B is 20% - 0% = 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (Gewinnsumme) and the winning probabilities (Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit) between the two lotteries. Specifically, they noted that Lottery A has a lower potential win but a higher probability of winning compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the higher probability of winning with Lottery A outweighs the consideration of the lower potential win, indicating a preference for a higher chance of winning over a potentially higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual instead focuses on the comparison of winning probabilities and amounts.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (20% difference) over Lottery A (25% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the higher probability of winning, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference in probability ranges, while the individual focuses on the comparison of winning probabilities and amounts, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (6000 Euros), so the difference is 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (3000 Euros), so the difference is 90%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning for both lotteries and compared them, noting that the probability of winning something in Lottery B is 45% higher than in Lottery A (though the actual comparison should be between the probabilities of winning, which are 90% for B and 45% for A, making B 45 percentage points higher in terms of the probability of winning, not 45% higher).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the higher probability of winning in Lottery B, despite its lower payout, suggesting that the likelihood of winning was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the comparative likelihoods of winning between the two lotteries without explicitly discussing the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (45% difference) over Lottery B (90% difference). However, the individual's justification emphasizes the higher probability of winning in Lottery B, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the comparative probabilities of winning and the higher likelihood of receiving a payout in Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's emphasis on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, making the difference 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, making the difference 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (0.1% difference between the two lotteries). They also considered the aspect of not making a loss, as both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its higher potential winnings and the small difference in probabilities between the two lotteries. They emphasized the importance of not making a loss, implying that the 0 Euro outcome in both lotteries was a significant consideration.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the difference in potential winnings and the small difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, not explicitly on the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, does not mention comparing the internal probability ranges of the lotteries but rather compares the lotteries based on potential winnings and the difference in their probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual calculated or considered the internal probability differences within each lottery as the basis for their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery B (60%). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual initially focused on the sums of the lotteries but then considered the percentages of winning or losing in each lottery, noting that Lottery A results in a 100% loss, while Lottery B has an 80% chance of loss and a 20% chance of no loss (implied by the 0 Euros outcome).
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a small chance of not losing (implied as ""something to win"" in the context of avoiding a loss), whereas Lottery A results in a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the differences in probability ranges within each lottery, but the individual's considerations, as described, focus on the presence of a chance to avoid loss in Lottery B and the certainty of loss in Lottery A, not explicitly on the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on the presence of a chance to avoid loss, not on the probability range difference.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the certainty of loss in one lottery versus the chance of avoiding loss in the other, rather than the differences in probability ranges within each lottery.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for the -4000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 80% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the -3000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential loss between the two lotteries and the difference in probabilities of these losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a lower loss but a higher probability of loss compared to Lottery A, and the probabilities of loss differ by only 5%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the difference in probabilities of losses and the magnitude of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 50% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the lower loss amount and the relatively small difference in loss probabilities, not directly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual does consider probabilities and outcomes, the basis for their decision (difference in loss amounts and small difference in loss probabilities) does not match the decision reason's criteria (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities). Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses and their associated probabilities for both lotteries, comparing the magnitude of losses and the probabilities of these losses. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by focusing on the probability of not losing (receiving 0 Euros) and the comparative sizes of the losses and their probabilities, rather than directly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes but not in the context of comparing the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 10% difference. However, the individual's justification does not directly reflect this rule; instead, it emphasizes the comparative probabilities of avoiding loss and the sizes of potential losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. The focus was more on the comparative sizes of losses and the probabilities of avoiding losses, rather than on the range of probabilities as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
10,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery.

For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses of each lottery (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), the probabilities of these losses (0.1% for A and 0.2% for B), and the probabilities of winning nothing (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by comparing the potential losses and their respective probabilities, noting that the probability of losing is almost the same for both lotteries, but the loss amount is lower for Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which were calculated as 99.8% for A and 99.6% for B. However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of winning 500 Euros in Lottery B and the 50% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A. They also mention the height of the sum that can be won in Lottery A but state it has little significance for them.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because of the guaranteed win in Lottery B and the risk of getting nothing in Lottery A. They seem to prioritize the certainty of the outcome over the potential higher reward in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, does consider the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the uncertainty in Lottery A, which indirectly relates to the concept of probability but does not directly address the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. The individual also prefers Lottery B but justifies this preference based on the certainty of the win and the potential for losing in Lottery A, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus is more on the certainty of the outcome rather than the probability ranges. Therefore, while the choice aligns, the reasoning process described does not closely follow the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."
12,"bezahlen müsste. Sondern dass ich sonst stattdessen einfach weniger Gewinn machen würde, sollte ich bei Lotterie A verlieren.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). However, to apply the decision reason correctly, we should consider the probabilities of the outcomes as given: the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning or losing are the same, 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probability is the same, 100% (since there's a 100% chance of -500 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a difference of 0% (since both outcomes have the same probability, 50%).
- Lottery B has a difference of 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability).
We can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the risk of loss. They noted that Lottery B offers a certain loss, while Lottery A offers a 50% chance of no loss. They also considered their personal financial situation, noting they have 2000 Euros and any loss would reduce potential gains rather than affecting their current wealth.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by preferring the 50/50 risk of Lottery A over the certain loss of Lottery B, considering their financial situation and the potential impact of losses on their gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery's outcomes. However, the individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries. Instead, they focus on the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the chance of no loss in Lottery A, and their personal financial situation.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Given that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), according to the decision reason, the individual should be indifferent. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the preference for a chance of no loss over a certain loss, not on the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined to make their decision. Their considerations and justifications do not align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% and the minimum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual considered all aspects and compared the overall probabilities of winning for both lotteries. The individual notes that Lottery B offers a 50% chance of winning, while Lottery A only offers a 25% chance of winning. The individual prioritizes the higher probability of winning in Lottery B over the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) with the information considered by the individual (overall probabilities of winning), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the specific difference between minimum and maximum probabilities for each lottery. Instead, the individual focused on the overall probability of winning. Additionally, the individual's justification for the choice (prioritizing the higher probability of winning) does not align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 25% and 50%). Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (25%) between its minimum and maximum probabilities compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries and the amount of money that could be lost. They noted that Lottery A has a 25% chance of losing 6000 Euros, which they found unappealing, but also recognized that the probability of losing any money at all is lower in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A despite its higher potential loss because they preferred the higher probability (75%) of losing no money (0 Euros) in Lottery A compared to the 50% chance in Lottery B. They were influenced by the desire to avoid losing money and the comparative probabilities of doing so in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual discusses probabilities, their focus is more on the absolute probabilities of losing money and the amounts, rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its smaller difference in probabilities. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the desire to minimize the loss and the higher probability of not losing any money, not explicitly considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on minimizing loss and the comparative probabilities of not losing money does not reflect the decision reason's emphasis on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), resulting in a difference of 99.8% (or 0.998). For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (or 1), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B (100% chance), the significantly higher potential payout of Lottery A compared to Lottery B (5000 Euros vs. 5 Euros), and the fact that there's no financial investment required, making the risk of Lottery A more palatable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify choosing Lottery A based on its high potential payout compared to Lottery B's low payout, despite the very low probability of winning in Lottery A. The individual also mentions the lack of a financial investment as a factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's considerations, as described, focus more on the potential payouts, the certainty of one option, and the lack of financial investment rather than the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for potentially choosing Lottery A does not mention the probability differences as a deciding factor but rather the potential reward and the absence of a financial risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, was used to make the decision. The focus of the individual's deliberation, as reported, was on the potential payouts and the certainty of one of the options, not on the probability differences as specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probability are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the loss amount of Lottery A (-5 Euros) and the risk of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B, noting the risk is very low but still present.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the loss of 5 Euros is not significant, and despite the low risk, they do not want to take the chance of losing 5000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration is more about the magnitude of potential losses and the perceived risk rather than explicitly comparing probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (since its difference is 0%). The individual chooses Lottery A but justifies it based on the potential loss amounts and risk perception, not explicitly the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The justification provided focuses on loss aversion and risk perception rather than the probability differences, suggesting that while the outcome matches, the reasoning process described does not directly align with the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning in Lottery B, the 50% chance of winning and the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A, and compared the win amounts of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure option with no chance of loss, despite comparing the win amounts of both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual's considerations were more about the presence of a secure option (100% win chance) and the risk of loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason does not provide a basis for preference between them. The individual, however, chose based on the security of not losing, not explicitly on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason, which is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, does not seem to have been directly used by the individual to make their decision. The individual's justification focuses on the security and risk aspects rather than the specific probability differences, which are the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. In this case, both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the solid sum of Lottery A and the potential loss in Lottery B, emphasizing the 100% win chance of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because it offers a 100% win chance, as opposed to Lottery B which carries the risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was centered around the certainty of winning in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, not explicitly on the probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose Lottery A because of its certainty, not because of comparing probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% and the minimum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery, which is 0% for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the outcome of receiving 0 Euros as neutral and prefers not to incur losses, as indicated by the preference for not getting losses in Lottery A.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by stating a preference for receiving nothing (in Lottery B) over potentially making losses (in Lottery A).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the preference for avoiding losses rather than the probability differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual’s justification is based on avoiding losses and the neutrality of receiving 0 Euros, not on the probability differences.
