sum of outcomes
"STEPS: 
1. Assessing the relevant information:
   - For lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros.
   - For lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros.
   - According to the decision reason, we only need to sum the outcomes of each lottery.

2. Summing the outcomes:
   - Lottery A: Sum of outcomes = 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros
   - Lottery B: Sum of outcomes = 2400 Euros

3. Comparing the sums:
   - The sum of outcomes for Lottery A (4900 Euros) is greater than the sum of outcomes for Lottery B (2400 Euros).

- For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros.

2. Summarize the information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason.
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery A = 2500 + 0 = 2500 Euros.
- Sum of outcomes for Lottery B = 2400 + 0 = 2400 Euros.

3. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum.
- Lottery A has an outcome sum of 2500 Euros.
- Lottery B has an outcome sum of 2400 Euros.
- Since 2500 Euros is greater than 2400 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason requires the sum of all outcomes of each lottery to be calculated by adding the outcomes independent of their probabilities.
- For Lottery A: The possible outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The sum of outcomes is: 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros.
- For Lottery B: The possible outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The sum of outcomes is: 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros.
- The relevant information has been derived: Lottery A has a sum of outcomes of 6000 Euros, Lottery B has a sum of outcomes of 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- According to the decision reason, the lottery with the higher outcome sum is preferred.
