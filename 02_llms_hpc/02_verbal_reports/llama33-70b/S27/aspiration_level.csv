STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1812.5 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1812.5 = 687.5, 2400 - 1812.5 = 587.5, and 0 - 1812.5 = -1812.5; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1812.5 = 587.5. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the values of Lottery A and Lottery B and noted that with Lottery A, there is a high probability of a gain that could be even 100 Euros higher than Lottery B's gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the potential for a higher gain with Lottery A compared to the certain gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level but does compare the potential outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A seems to be based on the potential for a higher gain, which aligns with preferring positive differences but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or its calculation.

Given these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (such as considering the potential for higher gains), it does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences from this level.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference between the two sums (2500 Euros and 2400 Euros) and the difference in probabilities of receiving money (33% vs 34%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a slightly higher probability of receiving money over a slightly higher amount of money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the difference between the sums and the probabilities, which does not directly relate to the aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual’s preference for a higher probability of receiving money.

Considering the above comparisons, the individual's focus on the probability of receiving money aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it. The verbal report suggests that the individual's decision was influenced by the desire for a higher probability of a positive outcome, which is in line with the spirit of the decision reason but lacks the specific calculation or mention of aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 0 Euros, and 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 1666.67 (4000 - 2333.33), -2333.33 (0 - 2333.33), and 666.67 (3000 - 2333.33). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A offers a positive difference (1666.67) with 80% probability and a negative difference (-2333.33) with 20% probability, and Lottery B offers a positive difference (666.67) with 100% probability, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning (mentioning an 80% probability for Lottery A) and compared it to a threshold (around 70%), suggesting they considered the likelihood of a positive outcome. They also mentioned not making a loss with Lottery A, implying consideration of the potential outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because of the high probability of winning, implying that the probability of a positive outcome was a key factor. They also mentioned that if the probability were lower (around 70%), they would have chosen the safer option, Lottery B, indicating a consideration of the trade-off between risk and certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual discussed probabilities and outcomes, there's no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing differences from such a level. However, the individual's focus on the probability of winning and the consideration of not making a loss suggest an implicit consideration of the potential for positive outcomes relative to some baseline, which could align with the concept of aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on its high probability of winning, which can be seen as related to having a higher probability of a positive outcome, but it does not directly reference an aspiration level or comparison of differences from such a level.

Considering these comparisons, while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (such as considering probabilities and outcomes), there is no direct evidence that the aspiration level was explicitly calculated or used as a basis for the decision. The individual's focus was more on the probability of winning and the avoidance of loss rather than on the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while there are some similarities between the decision reason and the individual's decision process, the direct application of the aspiration level and the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level are not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's justification is more aligned with a general consideration of probabilities and outcomes rather than the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it's 25% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability (25%) of achieving a positive difference from the aspiration level compared to Lottery A (20%). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of receiving any money and evaluated it as high. They also thought about the possibility of receiving a small amount of money and considered this outcome highly likely. 

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the higher probability of receiving any money at all, indicating that the possibility of making a gain was more valuable to them than the specific sum they would finally receive.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the probability of receiving money and the value of making any gain, which aligns with considering outcomes relative to a reference point (though not explicitly stated as an aspiration level).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the option with a higher probability of receiving any money, which can be interpreted as preferring the option with a higher chance of a positive outcome relative to the implicit reference point of receiving no money.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it, their focus on the probability of receiving any money and valuing the possibility of making a gain suggests a consideration of outcomes in relation to a reference point (receiving no money), which somewhat aligns with the principle behind the decision reason. However, the exact mechanism of the decision reason (calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences) is not clearly reflected in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40 
This assessment reflects that while there are elements in the individual's decision process that align with the general idea of considering probabilities of positive outcomes, the specific decision reason provided, which involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of outcomes above this level, is not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the probability of receiving any money rather than on the specific probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there are indications that the individual considered related aspects, leading to a score above the midpoint but not indicating clear use of the reason."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. These differences are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference between the two sums (outcomes) and the risk of losing money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the potential for a higher sum (Verdopplung, meaning doubling), despite the relatively low probability of receiving this sum, because of the lack of risk of losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the difference between the sums but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification focuses on the potential for a higher sum and the absence of risk, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences, and the individual's justification does not align closely with the decision reason's rule. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does consider differences in outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason, albeit without explicit mention of probabilities or an aspiration level."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 6000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 3000 Euros, the difference is 3000 - 2250 = 750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 2250 = -2250; and for 6000 Euros, the difference is 6000 - 2250 = 3750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 0.2% chance of a positive difference (750), and Lottery B has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference (3750). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual does not believe they will receive money in this scenario but decided to choose the option with a slight chance of making a positive gain. They mention the decision was not easy because the positive outcome seems unlikely.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the desire to have any chance of a positive gain, despite considering the outcome unlikely. They also mention the decision feels somewhat irrelevant due to the low probability of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the possibility of making a positive gain, which aligns with considering positive differences from an aspiration level. However, they do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is about choosing the option that offers any chance of a positive outcome, which indirectly aligns with preferring a lottery based on the probability of positive differences. However, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual applied the specific rule of comparing probabilities of outcomes above an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's focus on the possibility of a positive gain and their desire to choose an option that offers any chance of making a positive outcome slightly aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on positive differences. However, the lack of explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level, comparing probabilities of positive differences, or applying a rule based on these differences makes it uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used. The verbal report suggests a more intuitive or simplistic approach to choosing based on the desire for any positive outcome, rather than a structured application of the decision reason. Thus, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating that while there's a slight alignment, it's more likely that the decision reason was not explicitly used as defined."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros) and Lottery B has no chance of a positive difference (as -3000 is less than the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the values of the two lotteries, specifically considering the 20% probability of not losing additional money in Lottery A and the certain loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B. They also thought about the difference in potential losses between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided that a 20% probability was not enough to risk losing an additional 1000 Euros (the difference between the losses in Lottery A and Lottery B). They also mentioned that if the difference in potential losses between A and B had been greater, it might have changed their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of the difference in potential losses and the probability of not losing additional money touches upon the concept of comparing outcomes, but it does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the risk of losing an additional 1000 Euros and the insufficient probability to justify this risk, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual considered probabilities and differences in outcomes, the focus and the specific rule applied do not match the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the general consideration of probabilities and outcome differences."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-4000 + 0 + -3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -4000 Euros, the difference is -2250 Euros; for 0 Euros, the difference is 1750 Euros; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -1250 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the aspiration level, we can calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery A, the positive difference occurs when the outcome is 0 Euros, which happens with 75% probability. For Lottery B, the positive difference also occurs when the outcome is 0 Euros, which happens with 80% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and it would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability (80%) of a positive difference from the aspiration level compared to Lottery A (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and the differences in the amounts that could be lost. They mention that when the sums (outcomes) do not strongly differ, their focus shifts to the probabilities, and even small differences in probabilities can be decisive in their choice.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B over Lottery A by mentioning that a difference of 5 percentage points in probability (which they believed was the difference, though they were unsure if they remembered correctly) was enough to outweigh the potential loss of an additional 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual discusses probabilities and outcomes, they do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level. However, they do emphasize the importance of probabilities when outcomes are similar, which aligns with the spirit of comparing probabilities of positive outcomes (or less negative outcomes) but does not directly match the decision reason's specific criteria.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery B because of its slightly higher probability, which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a less negative (or more positive) outcome, but this is based on a direct comparison of probabilities and potential losses rather than an explicit calculation of differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's focus on probabilities and their impact on the decision when outcomes are similar aligns with aspects of the decision reason, the explicit calculation and comparison based on an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason are not clearly described in the verbal report. Therefore, it seems the individual's decision process shares some intuitive similarities with the decision reason but does not directly follow its specific rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30"
9,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: -6000 - (-2250) = -3750, 0 - (-2250) = 2250, -3000 - (-2250) = -750, and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both options, the amount of money to be lost, and the difference in the amounts between the two options. They mentioned that losing 3000 Euros is a significant amount and were not willing to risk it easily. They also compared the amounts of 6000 Euros and 3000 Euros, considering the former as not much more absurd than the latter despite being double. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on their perception of the risk of losing money, the significance of the amounts, and the comparison of these amounts. They implied that a difference of 1000 Euros would have changed their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the amounts to be lost and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level. However, their focus on the significance of the amounts and the comparison between them indirectly touches upon the concept of differences from a reference point (aspiration level).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is more centered around the perceived risk and the significance of the amounts rather than explicitly comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, their discussion implies a consideration of how likely they are to end up with a ""better"" outcome (less loss or more gain), which could be interpreted as related to the concept of positive differences from an implicit aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention or clearly apply the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While there are indirect hints at considering the significance of amounts and comparing them, which could relate to an aspiration level concept, the direct application and consideration of probabilities of positive differences as per the decision reason are not evident. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the individual not using the decision reason as described, but with some elements of their thought process touching upon related concepts."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -3000, and 0, which is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750, 0 - (-2250) = 2250, -3000 - (-2250) = -750, and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a 99.x% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, which is a positive difference from the aspiration level, and a small probability of a negative difference. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the values of the outcomes and the probabilities, focusing on the high probability (99.x%) of receiving 0 Euros. Second, the individual's justification for the choice was to minimize the loss, as they felt that the differences in probabilities (0.1% vs 0.2%) did not make a significant difference in their perception of the possibilities. They also mentioned having the mindset that they would not have to experience the loss anyway. The individual's deliberation process seems to focus on the probability of receiving 0 Euros and the magnitude of the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (values of outcomes, probabilities, and minimizing loss), there seems to be a partial overlap. The individual did consider the outcomes, but not explicitly the aspiration level or the differences from it. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual's justification (minimizing loss), there is no clear alignment. The individual's focus on minimizing loss and their mindset about not experiencing the loss do not directly relate to the decision reason's rule. Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment indicates that it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their deliberation process and justification do not closely align with the decision reason's rule and relevant information. However, the individual's consideration of the outcomes and probabilities suggests that there might be some indirect relation to the decision reason, preventing a complete certainty that the decision reason was not used (0)."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 Euros (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 Euros (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0 Euros (no difference). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (but a 100% chance of no difference), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of money in the two options, the risk associated with choosing Lottery A, and the impact of previous decisions. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they did not want to risk losing the chance to gain 500 Euros for the possibility of gaining only an additional 500 Euros. They were influenced by the risk and the outcomes of previous decisions.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing differences from this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the risk and the specific outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the certain gain over the risk of losing, which aligns with avoiding negative differences but does not explicitly match the decision reason’s rule about positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision to choose the certain gain (Lottery B) over the risky option (Lottery A) aligns with avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, which indirectly relates to the concept of aspiration levels and differences. However, the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's specific criteria of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the calculated aspiration level. Therefore, while there is a vague alignment with risk aversion, the specific application of the decision reason as described is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we proceed step by step.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The reason then considers the differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level. For Lottery A, the differences are -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500. For Lottery B, the difference is -500 - (-500) = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (when the outcome is 0 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the values of the lotteries, considered the probability of not losing money in Lottery A (1/2), and thought about the differences in losses between the two lotteries. They seemed to weigh the potential loss of 500 Euros against the possibility of losing nothing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the realistic chance of not losing money with Lottery A, the relatively smaller difference in losses when considering the potential upside of no loss, and the psychological impact of losing 500 Euros versus the possibility of avoiding loss altogether.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and differences in outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. However, the individual did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification does emphasize the importance of avoiding loss and the probability of not losing money, which could be interpreted as considering positive differences (in this case, the ""positive difference"" being not losing money). However, the individual's reasoning seems more focused on the absolute outcomes and the psychological impact of losses rather than explicitly on the probability of positive differences from a calculated aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report shows some alignment with the considerations relevant to the decision reason, such as focusing on probabilities and differences in outcomes. However, the explicit calculation of an aspiration level and the comparison of probabilities of positive differences as required by the decision reason are not clearly mentioned. The individual's justification is more intuitive and focused on the psychological aspects of loss and the probability of avoiding loss, rather than a strict application of the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while there is some similarity in the considerations, it does not strongly indicate the use of the specific decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes (6000, 0, 4000, 2000, 0) is (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 12000 / 5 = 2400 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2400 = 3600 and 0 - 2400 = -2400; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2400 = 1600, 2000 - 2400 = -400, and 0 - 2400 = -2400. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 6000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level). In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 4000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason can be applied, but it would suggest indifference between the two lotteries based on the calculated probabilities of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning any amount of money and the value of receiving a gain, even if it's less than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning any amount of money was 25% higher than in Lottery A, and they valued receiving some gain over receiving none.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes above this level. The individual considered the probability of winning any amount of money, which aligns partially with the concept of positive differences but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of outcomes above it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would suggest indifference in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the overall probability of winning any amount of money and the value of receiving a gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. While there is a mention of preferring to receive some gain over none, which could vaguely relate to the concept of positive outcomes, the explicit calculation and comparison based on an aspiration level are not mentioned. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility of some indirect influence, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2000) = -4000 and 0 - (-2000) = 2000; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2000) = -2000, -2000 - (-2000) = 0, and 0 - (-2000) = 2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, specifically the high probability of not losing money in Lottery A (75% chance of 0 Euros) and the potential losses in Lottery B (-4000 Euros or -2000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the probability of losing more money against the potential losses, implying a consideration of the trade-offs between the outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level, but does consider the potential losses and their probabilities, which relates to the concept of differences from a reference point.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification involves weighing the potential losses and their probabilities, which could be interpreted as considering the impact of outcomes relative to a reference point (though not explicitly stated as an aspiration level).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual considers the trade-offs between outcomes and their probabilities, which is somewhat related to the decision reason, the direct application of the aspiration level concept and its rule is not clearly evident in the report. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but with some minor considerations that might align with its general principles."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1683.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5000 - 1683.33 = 3316.67 and 0 - 1683.33 = -1683.33; for Lottery B, 5 - 1683.33 = -1678.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A, which was deemed too low. They also compared the probabilities of the two lotteries and considered a hypothetical scenario where the probability of winning in Lottery A increased to 10% and the value decreased to 500 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning in Lottery A was too low, and a small gain was preferred over no gain. The focus was on comparing the probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention these aspects. Instead, the individual focused on the probability of winning and the preference for a small gain over no gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual's justification is based on the comparison of probabilities and the preference for a guaranteed small gain, without explicitly considering the aspiration level or the differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The decision reason, which involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, does not appear to be explicitly mentioned or considered in the individual's verbal report. The individual's focus on the probability of winning and the preference for a guaranteed small gain over a low-probability high gain does not align with the specific rule of the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual in the manner described by the decision reason."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5 + (-5000) + 0)/3 = -1685 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -5 - (-1685) = 1680 Euros; for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1685) = -4315 Euros and 0 - (-1685) = 1685 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probability of a positive difference in Lottery A is 100% (one outcome with a positive difference of 1680 Euros) and the probability of a positive difference in Lottery B is 99.9% (one outcome with a positive difference of 1685 Euros), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual initially considered Lottery A based on intuition but changed their mind after thinking more about it. They mention the low probability of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B, implying they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to revolve around the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery B, which led them to reconsider their initial choice. However, they also express that in a different situation, they might have chosen Lottery A, indicating some level of uncertainty or context-dependent decision-making.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences, but they do consider the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification focuses on the low probability of a significant loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences but does not directly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the aspiration level or the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. While they consider outcomes and probabilities, their justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used this decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities of the outcomes are given, we can proceed to assess the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing money and was not willing to take this risk. They were aware of this risk from the beginning when evaluating Lottery A. The individual prioritized receiving a sum of money over the specific amount, as long as the differences between the sums are not immensely different.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they did not want to take the risk of losing money, and the receipt of a sum of money was more important than the specific amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual, however, focused on the risk of losing money and the importance of receiving any sum, without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the specific differences between outcomes and an aspiration level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while risk-averse and focused on receiving a sum, does not explicitly discuss probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was more on avoiding risk and ensuring receipt of any sum, rather than on the specific rule outlined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there might be some superficial alignment in terms of risk aversion, the detailed process described does not match the decision reason closely."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 666.67 = 2333.33 Euros and -3000 - 666.67 = -3666.67 Euros; for Lottery A, 2000 - 666.67 = 1333.33 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the two options, thought about them briefly, and weighed the risk of making a significant loss to gain 1000 Euros more. They also considered the difference between the gains of A and B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided against taking the risk of a significant loss for a relatively small gain, stating that the difference between the gains of A and B would have had to be much greater to justify the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. While the individual does consider differences between gains, there is no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or considering probabilities of positive differences based on such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the risk of loss versus the potential gain and the difference between the gains of the two lotteries, without explicitly referencing probabilities of positive differences or an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision process as described does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While there is some consideration of differences between outcomes, the core elements of the decision reason (aspiration level calculation and preference based on probabilities of positive differences) are not clearly reflected in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the consideration of outcome differences."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, and for Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 = approximately 333.33 Euros. This aspiration level can be used to calculate the differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level for each lottery. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the two lotteries, added the monetary outcomes of Lottery B, and considered the difference between the outcome of Lottery A (1000 Euros) and the potential loss of Lottery B (-3000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that the difference between the certain gain of 1000 Euros and the potential loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery B was too large. This suggests that the individual was focusing on the potential downside of Lottery B compared to the certainty of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. While the individual did consider differences between outcomes, there's no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason. However, the individual's focus on the difference between the certain gain and the potential loss implies an intuitive consideration of how outcomes deviate from a reference point (in this case, possibly the zero or the certain gain of 1000 Euros), which aligns somewhat with the concept of aspiration level and differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery A because the potential loss in Lottery B was deemed too risky compared to the certain gain of Lottery A, which can be seen as preferring the option with a more favorable deviation from a reference point (though not explicitly the aspiration level calculated in Step 1). This preference for avoiding large negative deviations aligns with preferring positive differences, but the process described doesn't directly match the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's decision-making process, as described, shares some intuitive similarities with the decision reason, particularly in considering the differences between outcomes and a reference point. However, the explicit calculation of an aspiration level and the direct application of the decision reason's rule are not clearly evident in the verbal report. Therefore, while there's some alignment, it's not sufficient to conclude with certainty that the decision reason was used, leading to a score below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B, and 0 Euros for Lottery A. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a positive difference (as its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential loss of 6000 Euros and the potential gain of 6000 Euros, and seems to weigh these against the certainty of keeping their current amount of money (implied by ""bis jetzt erhaltenen Summe an Geld""). They also mention the idea of risk and the potential impact of knowing their current financial situation on their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that a loss of 6000 Euros is not worth the potential gain of 6000 Euros, indicating a risk-averse stance. They express a preference for maintaining their current financial state rather than risking a significant loss for a potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the potential outcomes and their risk aversion but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. However, their discussion implies consideration of the outcomes in relation to their current financial state, which could be interpreted as an implicit consideration of an aspiration level (maintaining their current financial state).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual prefers the certain outcome (Lottery A) over the risky option (Lottery B), which aligns with preferring fewer risks of negative deviations from their current state (aspiration level) rather than seeking positive deviations. This does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, as the individual's justification focuses more on avoiding loss than on seeking positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. However, there is an implicit consideration of risk and potential losses/gains that could be tangentially related to the concept of aspiration levels. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is more directly related to risk aversion and the perceived value of potential outcomes rather than the specific rule outlined in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as described, given the lack of explicit consideration of an aspiration level and the focus on risk aversion rather than probabilities of positive differences. However, it is not a 0 because there are implicit elements in the individual's reasoning that could be loosely connected to the concepts underlying the decision reason."
