STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the difference between €3500 (which is not an actual outcome of Lottery A but seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the lottery's potential outcomes) and €2400 does not make a big difference. They also consider the aspect of getting money for sure.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the option where they get money for sure, mentioning that €2400 is a lot anyway.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which involves calculating and comparing these means. The individual, however, discusses the certainty of receiving money and does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of receiving money, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed €2400.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason involves calculating mean outcomes and choosing the lottery with the higher mean, whereas the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome, not on comparing mean values of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries, which are available.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference of €100 and seems to consider the potential outcomes of the lotteries but does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing the total outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that €100 more or less does not matter and that they would not regret not getting €100 more if they won Lottery B. This suggests the individual is considering the difference in outcomes but does not explicitly discuss the calculation of means or the overall value of the lotteries based on their outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the difference in potential winnings and the impact of €100 more or less): The individual does not explicitly consider the mean outcomes or the total sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the difference in winnings and personal satisfaction with the choice): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make their decision. The verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the mean outcomes of the lotteries or a comparison based on the sum of outcomes divided by the number of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the potential regret of not winning anything with Lottery A when they could have won 3000 Euros with Lottery B. They also mention that the money is not part of their planned finances, implying it's a bonus.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to be based on the potential regret of missing out on a guaranteed 3000 Euros and the fact that the money from the lottery is not essential to their financial plans.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (regret of not winning, guaranteed amount of Lottery B, and the nature of the money). The individual's considerations do not directly align with calculating mean outcomes based on the number of outcomes regardless of probability.

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (regret and the nature of the money). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described. The decision reason focuses on mean outcomes calculated in a specific way, which is not mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems to be influenced by potential regret and the guaranteed nature of one of the options, rather than a calculation of mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities of winning (20% vs. 25%) and the difference in these probabilities (""5% sind kein rieeeesiger unterschied""), indicating they considered the probabilities and the outcomes implicitly by comparing the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because they would ""lieber mal die 5% mehr auf meiner seite haben"" (would rather have the 5% more on their side), implying they prefer the higher probability of winning, even though they acknowledge the difference in probabilities is not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses probabilities rather than mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the preference for a slightly higher probability of winning, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not considered in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B. Instead, the individual focuses on the probabilities of winning, indicating a different decision-making criterion was used. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of not winning in both lotteries (10% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B) and the potential regret of not choosing the other lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice based on the potential regret of losing, comparing the regret of losing with Lottery A (10% chance of not winning 3000 Euros) to the regret of losing with Lottery B (55% chance of not winning 6000 Euros), considering what they could have won if they had chosen the other lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considers the probabilities of not winning and the potential regret.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the potential regret and the comparison of probabilities, not directly on the mean outcomes of the lotteries.
Based on these comparisons, the individual does not directly consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries (""beide wahrsch. sind sooooooo gering""). Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be based on a fatalistic attitude (""wenn ich nichts gewinne mir denken, dass das universum es einfach nicht so wollte"") and a comparison to low-stakes games of chance (""wie bei dem hauptpreis bei einer 50ct tombola oder bei einem gewinnspiel""). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the low probabilities and uses a fatalistic justification. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) is not reflected in the individual's justification, which does not involve a comparison of mean outcomes. Based on these two comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean outcome is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because its mean outcome (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be focusing on the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery A and the certainty of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B. They mention being irritated if they chose Lottery A hoping for the 20% chance (of not losing 4000 Euros) but then ended up losing 4000 Euros. This suggests the individual is considering the potential outcomes and their associated probabilities, at least implicitly.

Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because they would rather not take the risk of losing 4000 Euros, even though they acknowledge it's a 20% chance. They express a preference for accepting the certain loss of 3000 Euros over the gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems more focused on the risk of the larger loss and the certainty of the smaller loss.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual chooses Lottery B, citing risk aversion or a preference for avoiding the potential larger loss. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by simply averaging the outcomes without considering their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, it would prefer Lottery B because -1500 is higher than -2000. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk difference between the two lotteries (mentioning a ""5% geringeren Risiko,"" which likely refers to the difference in probability of losing money between the two lotteries, 20% for A vs. 25% for B, but seems to misinterpret it as a lower risk for A, which might be a confusion since A has a lower chance of losing but a higher loss amount). The individual also considered the potential to save money to compensate for the loss and how they would feel about their choice.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for preferring Lottery B seems to be based on the feeling of comfort with the 75% chance of not losing money and the hope that this outcome occurs, rather than a direct calculation or consideration of the mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations involve risk perception, feelings about potential outcomes, and a misguided comparison of risk levels.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual also expresses a preference for Lottery B but based on different reasoning (feeling better about the higher probability of not losing and hoping for that outcome).

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's final preference aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The individual's justification is more emotionally and probabilistically driven rather than based on a calculation of mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, then prefers the lottery with the higher mean. For Lottery A, the mean is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because its mean outcome (-1500 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-3000 Euros). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions hoping that the 55% (probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B) would be on their side, indicating they considered the probability aspect of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not explicitly state their justification for choosing one lottery over the other in the provided report. The mention of hoping for the 55% to be on their side suggests a consideration of probability but does not clearly articulate a decision-making process or rule.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems to focus on the probability aspect rather than calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the individual’s justification is not clearly stated in terms of a decision rule and does not mention mean outcomes or a comparison of mean outcomes between the two lotteries, it does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, it would prefer Lottery A over Lottery B because -1500 is greater than -3000. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers both options to be painful but views Lottery A as less painful, specifically mentioning the significant loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery B. They also note that the probabilities of the two lotteries are similar.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the potential loss in Lottery B (6000 Euros) is perceived as a more significant risk due to its magnitude, despite acknowledging similar probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the magnitude of the potential loss and the similarity in probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the perceived risk of the larger loss in Lottery B and not explicitly on the mean outcomes or their calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A (€500) as a positive aspect and views the potential risk of losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery B as a negative aspect. They also express a cautious attitude towards taking risks, especially when there's a chance of getting nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing satisfaction with the guaranteed €500 and a reluctance to take on risk that might result in no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are equal in this case. However, the individual's deliberation focuses more on the risk aspect and the guarantee of Lottery A, rather than explicitly comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal mean outcomes, but the individual's justification is based on risk aversion and the appeal of a guaranteed outcome, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-500 Euros) since there's only one outcome. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, leading to indifference between the two lotteries. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their counts.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 50% probability of Lottery B, comparing it to a coin toss, and acknowledges the risk of losing 1000 Euros but also notes the possibility that nothing might happen (i.e., winning 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the probability aspect and the potential impact of the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing the average outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their counts) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential impacts): The individual's focus is more on the probabilities and the potential outcomes rather than calculating means or averages.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on probabilities and outcome impacts): The individual does not explicitly discuss mean outcomes or a systematic comparison of averages between the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The verbal report does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes, which is central to the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000, 2000, and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 and 0 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (6000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2666.67 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions not being sad about potentially winning nothing, preferring a higher probability of winning something just to experience the outcome, and views any win as a nice surprise. They also mention that the amount won does not play a significant role in their decision. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they prefer to see if they win something or not, implying they are motivated by the experience of potentially winning, regardless of the amount. The justification does not explicitly mention comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries or considering the outcomes independently of their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the experience of winning and the higher probability of getting some outcome, not the mean of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery B, but the individual chose Lottery A based on different criteria (the experience of potentially winning something). The individual's justification does not align with the rule of preferring the lottery based on the mean of its outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery B would be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 75% probability of an outcome (implied to be from Lottery A, as it's the only one with a 75% probability for a specific outcome) and compares it with the risk of losing a lot of money in Lottery B, which they describe as having a ""coin toss-like high risk.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk aspect and the probability of losing, particularly highlighting the high risk in Lottery B without explicitly calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and risk of losing money): The individual does not mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the risk and probability of losing): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there's no mention of calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. Instead, the focus is on the risk and probabilities associated with the outcomes, suggesting a different decision-making process was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (5 Euros) / 1 = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (5000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = 2500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual thought about receiving €5 for free and considered the possibility of participating in Lottery B without a cost. They seemed to focus on the potential gain and the cost of participation.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for potentially choosing Lottery B was based on the realization that participation might not be costly, suggesting a consideration of the potential gain without a clear calculation or comparison of the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule involves a specific calculation (mean outcome) that is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification seems to be based on a different aspect (potential gain without considering the cost of participation and the probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries based on their outcomes alone, independent of their probabilities. The focus on potential gain and participation cost in the verbal report does not align with the calculation-based decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-5000 + 0) / 2 = -2500 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-5) / 1 = -5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -5 is greater than -2500.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the ability to forgo 5 Euros (from Lottery A) without significant long-term concern, implying a consideration of the loss amount and its impact on their life. They also mention the significant loss from Lottery B and its potential long-lasting impact.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by focusing on the ability to cope with the certain loss of 5 Euros from Lottery A and the significant distress a large loss from Lottery B would cause, indicating an emphasis on the emotional and practical impact of the losses rather than a direct calculation of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (emotional and practical impact of the losses), it appears there is a discrepancy. The individual does not mention calculating or considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the coping mechanisms and emotional impact of the losses), it is clear that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not seem to have used the decision reason (calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities) to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and the number of outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report is brief and in German, translating to ""to free, risk-free money, I say no not."" This suggests the individual considered the aspect of risk (or lack thereof) in their decision. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies an attraction to risk-free options, which aligns with preferring a certain gain (Lottery A) over a risky one (Lottery B), but it does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing outcomes directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their mean) with that considered by the individual (risk-free aspect). While the individual's focus on risk-free money does not directly align with calculating means, it does align with the outcome of preferring Lottery A, which is the risk-free option and also has the higher mean outcome according to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (attraction to risk-free money). The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification both lead to preferring Lottery A, but they do so through different rationales.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual used the specific decision reason of calculating and comparing mean outcomes to make their decision. The individual's focus was more on the risk-free nature of one of the options rather than on the mean of the outcomes. However, the preference for the risk-free option (Lottery A) coincidentally aligns with the preference that would be derived from the decision reason, suggesting a slight, indirect connection. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a minor alignment in the final preference."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 2000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certain amount of 2000 Euros from Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, indicating they considered the outcomes and the certainty of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because 2000 Euros is a lot of money and it comes with a 100% probability, implying they prefer the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher gain with risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the preference for certainty and the perception of 2000 Euros being a significant amount, rather than explicitly comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. The individual's focus is on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with the other lottery, rather than calculating and comparing mean outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 Euros - 3000 Euros) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 1000 Euros / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions not wanting to risk their wealth with Lottery B, implying they considered the risk or potential loss associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement about not wanting to risk their wealth suggests they are concerned about the potential negative outcome of Lottery B, which indirectly implies a consideration of the outcomes but does not directly mention calculating means or comparing them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and potential loss): The individual's consideration does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding risk): The individual's justification is based on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report focuses on risk aversion and the avoidance of potential loss rather than explicitly comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason, which is based on calculating and comparing mean outcomes, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to involve the potential gain and loss of €6000 in Lottery A, and there's a mention of it feeling like a gamble, which suggests they considered the risk or uncertainty involved. Second, the individual's justification for their choice seems to be based on the unappealing nature of the risk associated with Lottery A, specifically the possibility of losing €6000, which outweighs the potential gain for them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk, potential gain and loss), it appears the individual focused more on the risk and specific outcomes rather than calculating or considering the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (0 Euros) according to this rule, it would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification does not mention or imply a calculation or consideration of mean outcomes, nor does it reflect a process of comparing mean outcomes between the two lotteries. Instead, it emphasizes the aversion to the gamble presented by Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
This assessment is based on the conclusion that the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's justification is centered around the risk and appeal of the potential outcomes rather than a calculated comparison of mean outcomes."
