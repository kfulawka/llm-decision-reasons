STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived, we can proceed. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a higher outcome sum (4900 Euros) than Lottery A (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the potential additional 100 Euros of Lottery B, along with the risk of not winning anything in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential additional 100 Euros in Lottery B were not worth the risk of not receiving any winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes, but the individual's consideration was on the guaranteed win and the risk associated with the potential higher outcome, not directly on the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (Lottery B), but the individual's justification is based on risk aversion regarding the guaranteed win versus the potential for a higher outcome with some risk, not on comparing the sums of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses solely on the sum of outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual's focus was more on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with the potential higher reward, rather than on the total sum of possible outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these two sums, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the comparison of the potential gains and the desire for a higher probability of winning, indicating that the decision was influenced by both the amount of the potential gain and its probability, rather than just the sum of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains), it appears the individual focused more on the interplay between the amount of the gain and its probability rather than just the sum of the outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual's justification (focusing on the balance between gain amount and probability), it's clear that the individual's decision process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual did not mention considering the sum of the outcomes as the basis for their decision.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is that it is a secure gain and they wanted to avoid risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and gains, but not the sum of outcomes.
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) does not match the individual's justification (avoiding risk and preferring a secure gain). The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B, rather than the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the sum is 4000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes of each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and gains (outcomes), focusing on the difference between the higher gain and the one with the higher probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on setting a higher value on a higher probability when the difference in gains was not very large.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains, with a focus on their comparative differences). The individual did not mention considering the sum of outcomes as a factor in their decision-making process.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a higher probability when gain differences are not significant). The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not align, as the individual prioritized probability over the absolute outcome values or their sums.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcome sums of the two lotteries: 3000 Euros for A and 6000 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning with Lottery A and the absence of a threatening loss. They also compared the probabilities of winning between Lotteries A and B, noting that A had a much higher probability of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the higher probability of winning with Lottery A and does not mention the sum of the outcomes of the lotteries. The individual states that the potential gain from Lottery B was not a consideration due to its lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the sum of the outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probabilities and the absence of a threatening loss, not on the sum of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its higher probability of winning, not the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros (since 6000 + 0 = 6000). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros (since 3000 + 0 = 3000). The information relevant to the decision reason is the outcome sums of the two lotteries, which are 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and assumed they would win 0 Euros, making the choice between the lotteries seem irrelevant. However, they also noticed the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher probability of winning, despite initially thinking the choice was irrelevant due to the assumption of winning 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities and the assumption of winning 0 Euros.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher probability, not the sum of outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, as their justification for choosing Lottery B was based on probability, not outcome sums.

7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (-3000 > -4000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high losses in both lotteries, the difference in potential loss between Lottery A and Lottery B (1000 Euros), and the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual weighed the 20% chance of no loss against the higher potential loss in Lottery A and decided that the chance was worth the potential higher loss, leading them to choose Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities, focusing on the difference in potential losses and the chance of no loss, rather than the sum of outcomes as per the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B, but the individual chose Lottery A based on the probability of avoiding loss, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery based on the sum of its outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and the potential for avoiding loss, not just the sum of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. Since these sums can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and compared the possible loss sums, indicating they looked at both the probabilities and the potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a lower probability of loss over a smaller loss amount because even the smaller loss is very high. This suggests the individual's decision was influenced by the desire to minimize the risk of any loss, rather than solely focusing on the total potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered both the probabilities and the potential losses, not just the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative), which would be Lottery A (-3000 Euros), but the individual's justification is about minimizing the probability of loss and considering the magnitude of potential losses, not directly about comparing the sums of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery based solely on the sum of its outcomes, as their justification involved considerations of probability and the magnitude of potential losses, not just the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros + 0 Euros = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros + 0 Euros = -6000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is greater than -6000 Euros, according to this reason, Lottery A would be preferred. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and losses of both lotteries, specifically comparing the likelihood of incurring a loss in each.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of not incurring a loss (i.e., getting 0 Euros) was higher in A than in B, and they were hesitant to risk the higher loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, disregarding probabilities. In contrast, the individual considered both probabilities and the magnitude of losses, indicating a different focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative), which would lead to choosing Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on the comparison of probabilities of avoiding a loss and the risk of higher losses, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros (since 0 Euros * 99.9% + -6000 Euros * 0.1% simplifies to just considering the outcomes). For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these two sums: -6000 Euros for Lottery B and -3000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared probabilities and losses, noting that a loss was very unlikely in both options but slightly more likely in one, with the loss being twice as high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the comparison of the likelihood and magnitude of losses, considering both the probability and the amount of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes (-6000 Euros for B, -3000 Euros for A), while the individual considered both the probabilities and the magnitude of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (less negative), which would be Lottery A (-3000 Euros is ""higher"" than -6000 Euros in this context). The individual's justification, however, involves a comparison of probabilities and loss magnitudes, not just the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses solely on the sum of outcomes independent of their probabilities. The individual considered both the probability and the magnitude of the potential loss, which suggests a more nuanced decision-making process than the one outlined by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 1000 Euros + 0 Euros = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 500 Euros. Since we can derive the necessary information (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) from the given lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain in Lottery B, the probabilities of Lottery A, and compared the gains.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the additional potential 500 Euros in Lottery A were not worth the risk of receiving no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual considered the certain gain, probabilities, and the comparison of gains, not explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on the risk of not gaining anything versus the potential additional gain, not directly on the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -1000 Euros + 0 Euros = -1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is -500 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, the reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: Lottery B has a total outcome sum of -1000 Euros, and Lottery A has a total outcome sum of -500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and losses, comparing them and thinking about whether a possible higher loss is worth the chance of no loss. They specifically mentioned comparing the amounts (500 Euros more) and considered 50% a good or balanced chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the comparison of potential losses and the probability of no loss, weighing the higher potential loss against the 50% chance of avoiding any loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities, which does not align with the individual's consideration of both probabilities and losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on a comparison that includes probabilities and the potential for avoiding loss, not just the sum of outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum independent of probabilities. The individual's decision process involved weighing probabilities and potential losses in a manner that does not align with the decision reason provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries, focusing on the fact that there's a 50% chance of winning at Lottery A, which is twice as much as Lottery B's chance of winning. 
Second, the individual's justification for their choice emphasizes the difference in the number of winning chances rather than the sum of the outcomes or their probabilities. The individual states that the differences in gain heights were irrelevant to their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and number of winning chances), there's a mismatch. The individual did not consider the sum of the outcomes as the decision reason requires.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual's justification (focusing on the probability of winning and not the sum of outcomes), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that Lottery A had a higher likelihood of not making a loss, and Lottery B had too high a probability of a loss, even if the loss was smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of probabilities and the likelihood of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the reason would be indifferent.

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by calculating the sum of all outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 5 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 5000 Euros + 0 Euros = 5000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which is 5 Euros for Lottery A and 5000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, noting that a win in Lottery B was very unlikely (0.1% probability) compared to Lottery A, which had a 100% chance of winning. The individual's justification for their choice focused on the comparison of probabilities and stated that the difference in potential winnings did not play a role in their decision once they considered the probabilities.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the certainty of winning), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the sum of all outcomes for each lottery as their primary decision criterion. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the role of probabilities and the certainty of winning in their decision, which aligns more with a probability-based decision rather than one based solely on the sum of outcomes.

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (1500 Euros) compared to Lottery A (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain offered by Lottery B and the 50% loss probability of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery B by mentioning the risk associated with the 50% chance of loss in Lottery A and viewed Lottery B as a good option due to its certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual's consideration was based on the certainty of gain in one option and the risk of loss in the other, not explicitly on the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on risk aversion and the attractiveness of a certain gain, not on comparing the sum of outcomes.

The individual chose Lottery B due to its certain gain and deemed Lottery A too risky. The information considered by the individual includes the comparison of probabilities and gains, as well as the certainty of the gain in Lottery B. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the certainty of the gain and the perceived risk of Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, gains, and certainty), it appears the individual did not directly consider the sum of all outcomes as per the decision reason. Instead, the individual's decision was influenced by the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the certainty of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery A, not the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum than Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the possibility of loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed gain in Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was to avoid risk, highlighting the secure gain it offered. The described deliberation process focuses on the risk aspect and the certainty of the gain in Lottery A, without explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss in B, guaranteed gain in A), it's clear the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes as their decision criterion. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding risk and preferring a secure gain) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum). The decision reason and the individual's justification are based on different criteria, with the decision reason focusing on the arithmetic sum of outcomes and the individual focusing on the risk and certainty of the outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 6000 Euros + (-6000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since both have an outcome sum of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a large loss with Lottery A and the fact that Lottery B involves no loss or gain. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it seemed more sensible to avoid the risk of a large loss, even if it meant no potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the risk and potential loss, rather than the sum of outcomes. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the lotteries due to equal outcome sums, but the individual preferred Lottery B due to risk aversion, not because of the sum of outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus was on risk rather than the sum of outcomes.
