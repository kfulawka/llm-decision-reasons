STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward since there's only one outcome: 2400 Euros with 100% probability, so EV_A = 2400 * 1 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of losing with Lottery B and the chance of a slightly higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its potential for a slightly higher gain despite a small chance of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves considering all outcomes and their probabilities. The individual, however, focused on the potential for a higher gain and the small chance of losing, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification, while hinting at the attractiveness of a higher potential gain, does not explicitly state a preference based on expected value calculations.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of choosing based on the higher expected value. The individual's focus was more on the potential upside and the small risk of loss rather than a calculated comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply the calculation and comparison of expected values as the basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. Since EV_A > EV_B, the decision reason prefers Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes and their probabilities, which are available.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the winning possibilities of both lotteries to be nearly equal and noted that the potential gain from Lottery A is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the comparison of winning probabilities being similar and the difference in potential winnings, without explicitly mentioning expected values or a calculation thereof.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, which involve both outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification also leans towards preferring Lottery A but based on the higher potential gain and similar winning probabilities, not explicitly on expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report suggests an awareness of key components that influence expected value (outcomes and probabilities), and their preference aligns with what the decision reason would suggest. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's some alignment, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used, leading to a score below the midpoint but not at the lowest end, as there is some indirect evidence of consideration of relevant factors."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (4000 Euros * 0.8) + (0 Euros * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is simply 3000 Euros since it has a 100% probability of winning 3000 Euros. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 3200 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the win in Lottery A was guaranteed (""Gewinn bei Lotterie A war garantiert""). This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win was guaranteed (""daher wurde A gewählt""). The justification focuses on the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values (3200 Euros for B vs. 3000 Euros for A), but the individual's consideration was on the guarantee of the win in Lottery A, not explicitly on the expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A because its win was guaranteed, not because it had a higher expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The focus on the guarantee of the win in Lottery A, rather than a comparison of expected values, indicates that the decision reason based on expected value was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, EV = (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the chance of winning was nearly the same for both lotteries, which suggests they considered the probabilities. However, they decided based on the possibility of a higher gain in Lottery A, indicating they also considered the outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a higher possible gain, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of expected values or comparing the overall expected outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes, but not explicitly expected values). There's a partial overlap since the individual considered outcomes and probabilities, which are components of expected value, but they did not explicitly calculate or compare expected values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the higher possible gain). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since it focuses on the maximum possible gain rather than the expected value.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual considered aspects relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), their justification does not directly indicate the use of expected values to make the decision. The focus on the ""höherer Gewinn möglich"" (higher gain possible) suggests a different rationale than the one provided by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply the calculation or comparison of expected values, which is central to the decision reason. The individual's focus was more on the potential maximum gain rather than the expected outcome of each lottery."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.9) + (0 Euros * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning with Lottery A being greater.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the higher probability of winning with Lottery A, without explicitly mentioning the expected value or comparing the monetary outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, but the individual's verbal report focuses on the probability of winning, not explicitly on the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the higher probability of winning, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the expected value to make the decision, as indicated by the decision reason. Instead, the focus was on the probability of winning, which is a different aspect of the decision problem.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated by multiplying the monetary outcome by its probability and summing these products for each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 * 0.002 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 6000 * 0.001 = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the win probability and the height of the win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the win would be higher, given that the win probabilities were nearly identical.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, but the individual focused on the height of the win and the similarity in win probabilities, not explicitly on expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification was based on the height of the win when probabilities were considered nearly identical, not directly on expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

Reasoning: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the height of the win when win probabilities were nearly identical, not on the calculation or direct comparison of expected values. This suggests that the decision reason, which specifically considers the expected value of each lottery, was not the basis for the individual's decision. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as -3000 Euros * 100% = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is calculated as (-4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = -3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything in Lottery B, implying they looked at the outcomes and their associated probabilities, specifically the 20% chance of winning 0 Euros (or not losing) in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because there is a chance to lose nothing, indicating their decision was based on the potential to avoid loss entirely, rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which involves multiplying outcomes by their probabilities and summing these products. The individual focused on the chance of not losing anything, which does not directly indicate a calculation or comparison of expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification is based on the chance of avoiding loss, not on which lottery has a higher expected value. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the expected value decision reason to make their choice, as their justification does not mention or imply a comparison of expected values between the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -800 Euros for Lottery A and -750 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss associated with each lottery, noting that the loss was smaller in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the smaller loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (loss associated with each lottery): The individual considered the loss, which aligns with the concept of expected value but does not directly calculate or mention expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose based on the smaller loss): The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher expected value (-750 Euros vs. -800 Euros), and the individual also chose Lottery B but based on the smaller loss, not explicitly the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (both prefer Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering the expected values of the lotteries. The justification is based on the loss being smaller, which is related but not a direct application of the decision reason as defined. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as: EV_A = (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value can be calculated as: EV_B = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -2700 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the chance of not losing anything was higher in Lottery B, which seems to refer to the probability of not losing (or winning 0 Euros), but this interpretation may not align directly with the expected value calculation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the probability of not losing, rather than the expected monetary value of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which does not directly match the individual's focus on the chance of not losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, this rule does not provide a clear preference. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a comparison of expected values.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of losing (Chance zu verlieren) and the amounts to be lost (Betrag, der dann verloren wird) in both lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the comparison of the potential losses and their associated probabilities, noting that the chance of losing was nearly the same but the amount to be lost was smaller in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the comparison of the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing and amounts to be lost) shows a partial overlap, as both involve considering the potential outcomes and their likelihoods, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not directly align with the individual's justification (focusing on the smaller loss amount when the probabilities of losing are nearly equal), as the expected values of both lotteries are equal, which would suggest indifference according to the decision reason, but the individual seems to have made a distinction based on the magnitude of potential losses rather than their expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (500 Euros * 1) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Gewinnmöglichkeit bei 100 %"" for Lottery A, which translates to ""winning possibility at 100%"" for Lottery A. This indicates the individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for choosing one lottery over the other but highlights the 100% winning possibility of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, but the individual's report focuses on the certainty of winning with Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, as far as can be inferred, is based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected value.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery A does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. However, the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to equal expected values, and the individual's choice could be seen as consistent with this indifference, albeit for a different stated reason (certainty of winning).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's stated consideration (certainty of winning) does not directly align with the decision reason (expected value), the outcome of the decision reason (indifference due to equal expected values) could indirectly support the choice made, but the primary reason provided by the individual does not directly reflect the use of expected values as the decision criterion."

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is -500 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are -500 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing a high amount (50% chance of losing -1000 Euros) and the guaranteed loss of a smaller amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred a guaranteed smaller loss over a 50% chance of a larger loss, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of a higher loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probability of high loss and guaranteed smaller loss): The individual's considerations do not directly mention expected values but focus on the risk aspect and the certainty of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a guaranteed smaller loss over a riskier option): The individual's justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule since the expected values of both lotteries are the same, and the individual's choice seems to be based more on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus on avoiding a high loss and preferring a guaranteed smaller loss indicates a risk-averse approach rather than a consideration of expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A: EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B: EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are equal for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Felder Aufgedeckt und Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit bei Lotterie A war höher,"" which translates to ""Fields uncovered and the probability of winning at Lottery A was higher."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of winning (or outcomes) at Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies that the higher probability of winning (or the structure of outcomes) at Lottery A influenced the individual's decision, but it does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning at Lottery A). The individual's focus was on the probability of winning rather than explicitly on the expected values. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher probability of winning at Lottery A). The decision reason's rule is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Given that the expected values are equal for both lotteries and the individual's justification does not directly reference expected values, it seems the individual did not use the expected value decision reason as described.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1000 - 500 + 0 = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 + 0 = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -1500 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because there was a higher chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, but the individual considered the probability of not losing anything, which does not directly relate to calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the chance of not losing anything, not on the expected value of the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the probability of not losing, which aligns with a different decision criterion.

First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Felder aufgedeckt"" which translates to ""fields uncovered"" or ""options revealed,"" and it talks about the possibility of winning being the highest in Lottery B. This implies the individual considered the probability or certainty of winning in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests the individual chose Lottery B because it had the highest possibility of winning, implying a consideration of the probability of the outcome rather than the expected monetary value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning). The individual seems to focus on the probability of winning rather than the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose Lottery B due to the highest possibility of winning). Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's justification is based on a different criterion (certainty of winning).

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is straightforward: -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (-5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = -5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing anything as ""almost guaranteed"" in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of not losing anything was almost guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, but the individual focused on the guarantee of not losing anything, which does not directly relate to calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived guarantee of not losing, not on expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the guarantee of not losing anything and the perceived risk in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual's justification is based on a different aspect (guarantee of not losing). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected values was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A had a guaranteed win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win was guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win of Lottery A). The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing Lottery A because the win was guaranteed). The individual's justification does not directly reflect a comparison of expected values but rather focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus on the guaranteed win in Lottery A, without mentioning or implying a calculation or comparison of expected values, suggests that the decision reason based on expected value was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the guaranteed win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values, but the individual's consideration is focused on the guarantee of the win, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the guarantee of the win, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome over a risky one but does not directly mention comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's focus on the ""garantierter Gewinn"" (guaranteed win) suggests that their decision was based on the certainty of the outcome rather than a comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically involves calculating and comparing expected values to make a decision, and the verbal report does not indicate that the individual performed such a calculation or comparison, it is reasonable to conclude that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1000 Euros * 1 = 1000 Euros. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 0 Euros for Lottery B and 1000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing with Lottery B and the certainty of winning with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win), implying they preferred the certain gain over the risk of losing associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (possibility of losing with B and certainty of winning with A): The individual's considerations do not directly mention expected values but focus on the risk aspect and the certainty of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the safe win): While the individual's justification is about avoiding loss and ensuring a gain, it does not explicitly mention comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. However, the choice of the certain gain over a lottery with a zero expected value (and a significant risk of loss) aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher expected value in a broader sense of preferring a positive, certain outcome over a risky one with an equal chance of significant loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process. Instead, it focuses on the avoidance of potential loss and the preference for a certain gain. While the outcome of their decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing the lottery with the higher expected value), the reasoning process described does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision, but there is some alignment in the outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 Euros (0 * 100% = 0). For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 50%) + (-6000 * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the two lotteries. In this case, both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual noted that with Lottery A, there was nothing to win.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because there was nothing to win with Lottery A, implying they saw some potential benefit or appeal in Lottery B that was absent in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (nothing to win with Lottery A), it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (choosing B because A offered nothing), it appears the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since both lotteries have the same expected value and the individual's reason for choosing Lottery B does not mention expected value.
