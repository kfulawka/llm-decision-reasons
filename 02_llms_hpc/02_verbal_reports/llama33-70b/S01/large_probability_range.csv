STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% for all outcomes (since there's only one outcome), so the difference is 100% - 100% = 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery: 65% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a 100% chance of winning, implying they prioritized certainty of outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B because it has a 100% chance of winning, not because of the difference in probabilities within the lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its certainty of outcome (100% chance of winning), not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as 100% - 33% - 0% of other outcomes = 67% for 0 Euros, but we consider the explicit outcomes given) and the maximum probability is 33%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (similarly implicit) and the maximum probability is 34%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability = 33%, Minimum probability = 0% (considering the given structure, we actually look at the probabilities provided: 33% for the gain, and implicitly 67% for the loss, but the decision reason focuses on the difference between the highest and lowest probabilities of the explicitly mentioned outcomes).
- Lottery B: Maximum probability = 34%, Minimum probability = 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more probable to achieve a gain. This implies the individual looked at the probability of winning (getting a positive outcome) in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered probabilities but specifically mentioned looking at the probability of achieving a gain, which aligns more with comparing the probabilities of winning rather than calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the maximum and minimum probability, which would be Lottery A (33% - 0% = 33%) compared to Lottery B (34% - 0% = 34%). The individual, however, chose based on the higher probability of achieving a gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery B because it has a slightly higher probability of winning (34% vs 33%).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the higher probability of achieving a gain does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report indicates the individual made the decision based on the probability of winning, not the difference between the probabilities as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, I am certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 0 Euros with 80% probability implies 100% - 80% = 20% for the other outcome, but the minimum probability in the context of the reason seems to refer to the probability of the lowest monetary outcome, which is 80%) and the maximum probability is 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 75% (similarly, the probability of the lowest monetary outcome) and the maximum probability is 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between these probabilities for each lottery: for Lottery A, it's |20% - 80%| = 60%, and for Lottery B, it's |25% - 75%| = 50%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the amounts (Beträge) that could be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potential to win the higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, while the individual considered the amounts that could be won.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on the potential to win the higher amount, not the probability differences.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason provided, as the individual focused on the potential winnings rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 45%, so the difference is 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 90%, so the difference is 90%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability (90% vs 45%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is more probable. This implies the individual focused on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences in probabilities, but the individual considered the probabilities themselves, not their differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities, but the individual's justification is about choosing the lottery with the higher probability of winning, which aligns more with comparing the probabilities directly rather than their differences.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 3000 Euros outcome), making the difference 0.2%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 6000 Euros outcome), making the difference 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes all contributions (Beiträge, which in this context likely refers to outcomes or payouts) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on selecting the lottery that promises a higher gain because the probabilities of winning in both lotteries are similarly low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it seems the individual focused on the outcomes and the general low probability of winning rather than the specific differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the higher gain due to similarly low winning probabilities), there is a clear discrepancy. The individual's decision was not based on the difference in probability ranges but on the potential gain given the low probabilities of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make the decision. The focus was on the potential gain and the similar low probabilities of winning, not on the range of probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% (since there is only one outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as follows: 
- Lottery A: 60% difference
- Lottery B: 0% difference

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities, focusing on the possibility of not incurring a loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that has the possibility of not incurring a loss, mentioning that the difference between losses of 3000 and 4000 Euros was not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities, focusing on avoiding loss), it seems the individual did not directly consider the difference in probabilities between the lotteries as the decision reason does.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on avoiding loss and not finding the difference between 3000 and 4000 Euro losses significant), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual's focus was on avoiding loss rather than on the difference in probabilities.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's a 75% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 25% (for -3000 Euros), giving a difference of 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's an 80% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros), giving a difference of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual looked at all contributions and probabilities and chose the lottery where it is more likely to not incur a loss. This implies the individual considered the probabilities of not losing (0 Euros outcomes) in both lotteries. The justification for the choice focuses on avoiding a loss, highlighting the importance of the probability of the 0 Euros outcome in the decision-making process.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of not losing), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason suggests. Instead, the individual focused on the likelihood of avoiding a loss. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (choosing based on the higher probability of not incurring a loss). Therefore, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 10% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to not incur a loss. This implies the individual focused on avoiding a loss, which is related to the probability of the zero or negative outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered all outcomes and their probabilities but specifically mentions avoiding a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities (Lottery B, with an 80% difference), but the individual's justification is about minimizing the likelihood of a loss, not directly about the difference in probabilities between outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding a loss aligns more closely with considering the probabilities of specific outcomes rather than the difference between the probabilities of outcomes as the decision reason dictates. The verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (99.8% for Lottery A and 99.6% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher probability of not incurring a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual considered the probabilities and gains without explicitly mentioning the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, while the individual preferred the lottery with the higher probability of not incurring a loss. The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on avoiding loss rather than comparing probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for the choice, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The focus on avoiding loss and the consideration of probabilities and gains without explicit mention of probability differences suggest that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%
- Lottery B: Difference = 50%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all probabilities and amounts.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win definitely occurs, implying a focus on certainty of outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities but the focus was on the certainty of the outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing a lottery where a win is definite suggests they prioritized certainty over the probability difference, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A due to its 100% guarantee, not because of the probability difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros, implying a 0% chance of the -1000 Euros outcome is not the minimum, but the actual minimum probability is indeed 50% for the -1000 Euros outcome, and 50% for the 0 Euros outcome, making the minimum and maximum probabilities both 50%) and the maximum probability is 50%. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% since there's a 100% chance of -500 Euros. Thus, the difference for Lottery B is 0% (50% - 50% = 0%) and for Lottery A is 0% (100% - 100% = 0%). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on making a risk decision because it's possible to achieve no loss. The focus on risk and the possibility of no loss suggests the individual is considering the potential outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts, risk of no loss), it seems the individual did not directly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason dictates. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on the risk of achieving no loss). Since both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent, but the individual's justification does not reflect a consideration of this aspect.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for both 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), with the minimum being 25% and the maximum being 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), with the minimum being 25% and the maximum being 75%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%, and for Lottery B, the difference is 75% - 25% = 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities and chose the lottery with more events that promise a win despite having the same probabilities of winning compared to the other lottery. This suggests the individual considered the number of winning outcomes and their associated probabilities. 
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification focuses on the number of winning events and their probabilities, particularly noting the presence of multiple winning outcomes with the same probability as the comparison lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, talks about the number of winning events and their probabilities, not explicitly the range of probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the number of winning outcomes with the same probability, not the difference in probabilities. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described, since the focus was on the count of winning outcomes and their equal probabilities rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for -6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%. The difference is 50%. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a larger difference (50%) between its minimum and maximum probabilities compared to Lottery A (25%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is most probable to not incur a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which involves considering the probabilities. The individual considered all amounts and probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification is about minimizing the probability of loss, which does not directly relate to comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries. The individual's focus is on avoiding loss rather than on the probability range difference.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, implying a 0% chance of the higher outcome in the context of minimum probability) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for the 5000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is definitely expected, implying they prioritized certainty of a gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of probabilities and amounts in a manner that suggests they were looking for a difference in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of a win, which aligns more with choosing Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed, albeit small, win.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the range of probabilities rather than the certainty of a win or the comparison of expected values.

Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the probability of not incurring a loss), the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus was on avoiding loss, which does not necessarily relate to the range of probabilities in the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, also resulting in a difference of 0%. However, the key information relevant to the decision reason is the calculation of these differences. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on this criterion alone. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain, implying they prioritized certainty over potential higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and amounts, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason (probabilities).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would not prefer one over the other based on this rule. However, the individual's justification was based on the certainty of a win, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the certainty of the outcome, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the difference in probability ranges and the individual's choice was justified by a different criterion (certainty of winning), it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the expectation of a certain gain, implying that they focused on the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries. The described deliberation process indicates that the individual prioritized the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (all contributions and probabilities), it seems the individual did consider the probabilities but the focus was more on the certainty of gain rather than the range of probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (preferring the certain gain), it appears the individual's decision was not directly based on the decision reason's rule, as the certain gain in Lottery A aligns with preferring a 0% risk of loss but does not directly reflect a consideration of the probability range differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was the certainty of a gain, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not reflect the application of the decision reason provided."

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, but the decision reason specifically looks at the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but the individual's justification was based on achieving a certain win, not on probability differences. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention considering the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, and the justification is based on a different criterion (certainty of winning).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it has a 100% chance of 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on selecting the lottery that appears to guarantee no loss. The individual focused on avoiding a potential loss, as indicated by the phrase ""keine Verlust erziele"" (no loss).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities to avoid loss), it seems the individual did not specifically focus on the probability differences as the decision reason dictates. Instead, the individual's focus was on avoiding loss, which does not directly relate to comparing the range of probabilities between the lotteries. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (avoiding loss), it's clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since both lotteries have the same probability difference of 0%, making the decision reason's rule inapplicable or not influential in this specific scenario.
