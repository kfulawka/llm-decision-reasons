STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is straightforward since there is only one outcome: 2400 Euros * 100% = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is calculated as (2500 Euros * 33%) + (2400 Euros * 66%) + (0 Euros * 1%) = 825 Euros + 1584 Euros + 0 Euros = 2409 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. The expected value of Lottery B (2409 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A (2400 Euros with 100% probability) and the potential outcomes of Lottery B, including the high probability of winning either 2400 or 2500 Euros but also the 1% chance of winning nothing. They also thought about the difference between the potential wins and the risk involved.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential benefits of Lottery B (higher possible win) against the risks (1% chance of no win) and considering the relatively small difference between the potential wins. They ultimately decided the risk was not worth it, given the certainty of Lottery A and the consideration of potential prior losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries. While the individual discussed the outcomes and probabilities, they did not explicitly calculate or compare the expected values of the two lotteries. Instead, they intuitively considered the potential wins and the risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual, however, based their decision on the certainty of the outcome and the perceived risk, rather than explicitly on which lottery had a higher expected value. They chose Lottery A despite it having a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B, indicating that their decision was not solely based on maximizing expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. While they considered aspects of the lotteries that are relevant to calculating expected value (outcomes and probabilities), their justification for choosing Lottery A was based more on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome rather than a direct comparison of expected values. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied by calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities (33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B) and the outcomes (2500 Euros for A and 2400 Euros for B), noting a 1% difference in probability and a 100 Euro difference in the potential gain.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they preferred the higher gain despite the slightly lower probability, considering the probability difference negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes), we see the individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focused on the difference in probabilities and outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring the higher gain due to negligible probability difference), it appears the individual's reasoning is based on a simplification or intuition rather than a direct calculation of expected values. The individual's choice (Lottery B) actually contradicts the decision reason since Lottery A has a higher expected value (825 Euros) than Lottery B (816 Euros), but the individual chose B for its higher potential gain despite the lower expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 1) = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning for each lottery, specifically mentioning the 100% chance of winning with Lottery B and the 80% chance with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the 100% chance of winning offered by Lottery B over the 80% chance offered by Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning): The individual focused on the probabilities rather than calculating or comparing the expected values directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prefer the 100% chance of winning): The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected value. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher expected value, but the individual chose Lottery B based on its certainty.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains (4000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B), the probabilities of winning (20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B), and that both lotteries have no penalty, with the worst-case outcome being 0 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A by mentioning the difference in potential gains and the perceived higher win chance due to the higher potential gain, despite acknowledging after the fact that Lottery B might have been a better choice due to its probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (potential gains, probabilities, and the absence of penalties): While the individual considered some aspects relevant to calculating expected value (gains and probabilities), they did not explicitly calculate or mention expected values in their justification. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual focused on the difference in potential gains and perceived win chances rather than directly comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. The individual even questioned their decision afterward, suggesting a reconsideration based on probabilities, which indicates a potential misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of expected value in their initial decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered some relevant information (outcomes and probabilities), their justification for the choice did not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's post-decision reflection further suggests that the expected value was not the primary basis for their initial choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.9) + (0 Euros * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived, and it shows that both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning (90% for Lottery A) and the amount to be won (3000 Euros for Lottery A), as well as the comparison of the winning probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they perceived the deal (3000 Euros with 90% probability) as better, considering the worst-case scenario (getting 0 Euros) and comparing the winning probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts): While the individual considered probabilities and amounts, they did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (perceiving Lottery A as a better deal due to its higher winning probability and the consideration of the worst-case scenario): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they did not mention the expected value but rather focused on the probability of winning and the perceived quality of the deal.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason (comparing expected values) to make their decision. However, their focus on probabilities and the perceived value of the deal might indirectly relate to the concept of expected value, but it does not clearly demonstrate the application of the decision reason as defined.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, making the decision reason applicable but leading to indifference between the two lotteries since their expected values are equal.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have very low probabilities of winning and no penalties (losses) are involved. They highlight the difference in potential winnings (100% difference between 3000 and 6000 Euros) and consider the best outcome in the unlikely event of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by considering the potential gain in the unlikely event of winning, opting for the higher reward (6000 Euros) without incurring any losses in the more probable scenario of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which were not directly mentioned or considered by the individual in their verbal report. Instead, the individual focused on the potential winnings and the absence of losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values. However, the individual chose based on the potential for a higher gain in the unlikely event of winning, not explicitly considering the expected value of each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the potential for higher winnings without considering the probabilities in a manner that calculates or compares expected values, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is simply -3000 Euros since it has a 100% probability of occurring. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are -3200 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, specifically comparing the 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros in Lottery A with the 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B, and notes the 20% chance of losing 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the prospect of an 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros seems better than a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros, given the 20% chance of losing nothing in Lottery A. This suggests the individual is considering the potential for avoiding loss entirely as a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes): The individual considers the probabilities and specific outcomes, which aligns with the information needed to calculate expected values, but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification: The individual's justification focuses on the comparative risks and the potential for avoiding loss, rather than explicitly stating a preference for the lottery with the higher expected value. In fact, Lottery B has a higher expected value (-3000 Euros) than Lottery A (-3200 Euros), but the individual chooses Lottery A, suggesting that the decision was not based solely on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries and preferring the one with the higher expected value. Instead, the decision seems to be influenced by the potential for avoiding loss entirely, even if that means taking on a higher expected loss. This suggests that the individual did not use the decision reason as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is -800 Euros for A and -750 Euros for B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses (-4000 Euros for Lottery A with 20% probability and -3000 Euros for Lottery B with 25% probability) and compared the difference in loss amounts to the difference in probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because they believed the difference in potential loss (-1000 Euros) was not worth the slightly higher probability of loss (5% difference), and they considered the 20% to 25% probability difference as not significant enough to outweigh the loss difference, thus opting for the lottery with the lesser loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of -800 Euros for A and -750 Euros for B) with that considered by the individual (potential losses and their probabilities): The individual did consider the potential losses and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on the lesser loss and the perceived difference in probabilities): The individual's justification is based on a comparison of losses and probabilities but does not explicitly state a preference based on expected value. However, the decision to choose Lottery B because it has a lesser loss and the individual does not consider the 5% increase in probability significant enough to offset the -1000 Euro difference implies an intuitive understanding that aligns with preferring a higher expected value (since Lottery B has a ""less bad"" expected value of -750 Euros compared to -800 Euros for Lottery A).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating expected values or directly applying the decision reason, their justification for choosing Lottery B (based on the perceived lesser loss and the relative insignificance of the probability difference) intuitively aligns with the principle of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. However, the lack of explicit mention of expected values or a direct application of the decision reason introduces uncertainty, preventing a higher assessment of certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, -2700 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compares the potential losses and their associated probabilities between the two lotteries, focusing on the loss amounts and the chances of winning nothing (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because they perceived the loss of -6000 Euros with 45% probability as more favorable than the loss of -3000 Euros with 90% probability, considering the higher chance of winning nothing in Lottery B (55% vs. 10%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries (-2700 Euros). However, the individual's deliberation focuses on the comparison of loss amounts and the probabilities of winning nothing, not explicitly on the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual, however, does not express indifference and chooses based on a different rationale (comparing loss amounts and probabilities of winning nothing).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on a comparison of loss amounts and probabilities of winning, not on the expected values of the lotteries, which are equal. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated as EV = (outcome * probability). For Lottery A, EV_A = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6. For Lottery B, EV_B = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the expected values can be calculated. Both lotteries have the same expected value, indicating the decision reason would be indifferent between the two.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and the outcomes (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros) of the lotteries. They also mentioned the difference in potential losses and how they might better survive a loss of 3000 Euros compared to 6000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the potential survival from a loss, indicating a preference for the lesser loss (-3000 Euros) over the greater loss (-6000 Euros), despite acknowledging the probability difference is not significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities, which are relevant to calculating expected values, but they did not explicitly calculate or mention expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value (or is indifferent if the expected values are equal). The individual's justification, however, focuses on the ability to survive a potential loss rather than comparing expected values. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (survivability of loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make their decision, as evidenced by their focus on survivability of potential losses rather than expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 Euros * 1) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 500 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gaining 500 Euros with Lottery B and the 50% chance of gaining 1000 Euros with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it provides a guaranteed gain, ensuring a win in every case.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries, which are equal for both. However, the individual's focus was more on the certainty of the gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the expected values are equal, it would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the guarantee of a win, not explicitly on the expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the certainty of the gain rather than an explicit comparison of expected values, which is the core of the decision reason. Since the expected values of both lotteries are equal, the decision reason would not prefer one over the other, but the individual's reasoning was centered around the guarantee of a win, not the expected value calculation. This indicates that the decision reason, as defined, was not the basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-500 * 1) = -500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are -500 Euros for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions receiving 2000 Euros additionally and compares a 50% loss of 50% (which seems to be a misunderstanding of Lottery A's outcomes) to a 100% loss of 25% (which seems to be a misunderstanding of Lottery B's outcome, possibly considering it as a percentage of the additional 2000 Euros). The individual seems to be considering some form of net gain or loss but is misinterpreting the lotteries' outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because they perceive a net gain of 1500 Euros at 100%, which is a misinterpretation of the actual outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, which are not accurately represented in the individual's considerations. The individual's calculations and considerations do not align with the expected value calculations.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the individual misinterprets the lotteries' outcomes and calculates a perceived net gain incorrectly, their justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The individual's verbal report does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual misinterprets the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries and does not calculate or compare the expected values correctly. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we proceed as follows:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and the amounts to be won in both lotteries, focusing on the higher chance of winning something in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a higher absolute chance of winning (since with Lottery A, there's a 50% chance of getting nothing, which is less than the 75% chance of getting nothing with Lottery B), not explicitly mentioning the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning and amounts). The individual's considerations do not explicitly include the calculation or comparison of expected values.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring Lottery A due to a higher absolute chance of winning). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision is based on the chance of winning rather than the expected monetary value of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning any amount rather than the expected value of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as: EV_A = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value can be calculated as: EV_B = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered their current financial situation (being around 3000 Euros in debt) and the potential losses from each lottery, focusing on the worst-case scenario of each (-6000 Euros for Lottery A and -1000 Euros more than their current debt for Lottery B, implying a comparison of potential further debt).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the worst-case loss was less severe compared to Lottery A, considering their personal financial situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, but the individual's consideration was more focused on the worst-case financial outcomes and their personal financial situation rather than calculating or comparing expected values directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on minimizing the worst-case financial loss considering their current debt, not on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the worst-case scenario and personal financial implications rather than on expected values, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 5000 Euros * 0.1% + 0 Euros * 99.9% = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B, the small chance of getting 5000 Euros in Lottery B, and the certainty of getting 5 Euros in Lottery A. They also considered their current financial situation and the absence of penalties in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the small chance of winning 5000 Euros, which they perceived as a significant amount compared to the guaranteed 5 Euros from Lottery A, despite acknowledging the extremely low probability of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is the same for both lotteries. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but rather focuses on the potential outcomes and their personal financial situation.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual, however, chose based on the potential for a large gain, not explicitly on the basis of expected value calculations.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on expected values to make their choice. Instead, their decision seems to have been influenced by the potential for a significant gain and their personal financial situation, rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is -5 Euros (since -5 Euros with 100% probability). For Lottery B, the EV is -5 Euros * 0.001 = -0.05 Euros (since -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability). The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability (0.1%) of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B and compared it to the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A. They also mentioned considering human tendencies to prefer known outcomes over unknown ones and touched upon the concept of probability and the idea of accumulating wins over multiple attempts to mitigate losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B by underestimating the risk associated with the 0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros, suggesting a preference for avoiding the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A. They also reflected on potential long-term strategies and the psychological aspect of risk aversion.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual discussed probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly calculate or compare the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. Lottery A has an EV of -5 Euros, and Lottery B has an EV of -0.05 Euros, making Lottery B the preferred choice based on expected value. However, the individual's justification did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but rather focused on the perceived risk and psychological factors.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of expected value calculations to make the decision. While they chose Lottery B, which has a higher expected value, their justification was based more on the perceived low risk of the significant loss and psychological factors rather than an explicit comparison of expected values. Thus, it seems unlikely that the decision reason (comparing expected values) was the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1500 * 1 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an expected value of 1500 Euros and Lottery B has an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A (100% chance of 1500 Euros) and the potential outcomes of Lottery B (50% chance of 3000 Euros and 50% chance of -3000 Euros), including the personal financial implication of losing (-1000 Euros if they had only 2000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a guaranteed 1500 Euros, which was preferable over the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, especially considering their personal financial situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries (1500 Euros for A and 0 Euros for B), while the individual considered the specific outcomes and their personal financial situation, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A but is based on the avoidance of risk and the guarantee of a positive outcome, rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to align with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A) but does not explicitly use the language or calculation of expected values as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus is more on the risk avoidance and the guarantee of a positive outcome rather than a direct comparison of expected monetary values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery B, EV = (2000 * 1) = 2000. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50-50 chance of winning or losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the 100% chance of gaining 2000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of gain, implying a preference for certainty over risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, which aligns with the information needed to calculate expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B, but the justification provided focuses on the certainty of gain rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B due to its higher expected value, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, it emphasizes the preference for a certain gain over a risky option. This suggests that the individual might not have directly used the expected value calculation as their decision reason, even though their choice happens to align with what the expected value rule would suggest.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice matches the outcome of applying the decision reason, their stated justification does not clearly indicate that they used the expected value rule to make their decision. The emphasis on preferring a certain gain over a risky option suggests an alternative rationale for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV_A = (0.5 * 3000) + (0.5 * -3000) = 0. The expected value for Lottery B is EV_B = (1 * 1000) = 1000. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is that Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gaining 1000 Euros in Lottery B versus the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A, despite the higher potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because they would take a certain gain of 1000 Euros over a 50% chance of potentially incurring a loss, even with a higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries, while the individual considered the certainty of the gain and the risk of loss. Although related, the individual's focus is more on the risk aspect rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B, but their justification is based on the preference for a certain gain over a risky option with potential for loss, rather than explicitly stating a comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery B), but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual explicitly considered or compared the expected values of the two lotteries. The justification provided is more related to risk aversion and the preference for certainty rather than a direct application of the decision reason's rule. Therefore, while the outcome of the decision matches the decision reason's preference, the process described in the verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of the expected value as the basis for the decision."
20,"bracht oder ich hätte -6000 verloren, das ist sehr viel gewinn oder verlust, und die chancen waren 50-50, das heißt auch nicht zu meinen gunsten, da 50% verlust von 6000 sehr hoch ist. da nehme ich lieber 0 zu 100% von B, obwohl ich noch überlegt habe das risiko doch einzugehen da ich die vorherigen lotterien nicht so gut gespielt habe und 6000 gewinn natürlich mega attraktiv gewesen wären. aber dann dachte ich nee nicht pokern, lieber beständig sammeln weil das mit der wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung ist eben echt nicht so meins da sollte ich keine risiken eingehen weil ich keine expertin bin

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (6000 Euros * 0.5) + (-6000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 0 Euros * 1 = 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains and losses of Lottery A, the 50-50 probability, and the attractiveness of winning 6000 Euros. They also thought about their past experiences with lotteries and their lack of expertise in probability calculations.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because the 50% chance of losing 6000 Euros was too high, and they preferred the certainty of 0 Euros from Lottery B over the risk associated with Lottery A. They also mentioned considering their past performance and not wanting to take risks due to a lack of expertise in probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the expected values of the lotteries, which are equal for both options. The individual, however, focused more on the risk associated with Lottery A and the certainty of Lottery B, rather than explicitly comparing the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual, however, chose Lottery B because they wanted to avoid the risk of losing 6000 Euros, not explicitly because it had a higher expected value (since both have the same expected value).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on avoiding risk and the certainty of the outcome, rather than on comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, which are equal. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected value was not used by the individual to make the decision."
