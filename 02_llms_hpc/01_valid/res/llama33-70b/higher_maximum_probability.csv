To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. This involves evaluating whether we can derive the maximum probability for each lottery from the given information.

1. **Assessing Applicability**: The decision reason requires the maximum probability of each lottery. From the problem statement, we can directly derive these probabilities:
   - For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros).
   - For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros).

   Since we can derive this information directly from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries, the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner.

2. **Applying the Decision Reason**: Now, we apply the decision reason’s rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability.
   - Lottery A has a maximum probability of 66%.
   - Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%.

   Comparing these, 100% is greater than 66%. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A because Lottery B has a higher maximum probability.

To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be directly derived from the given probabilities of the lotteries. 
Thus, we can proceed with applying the decision reason.

For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (the probability of getting 0 Euros). 
Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, we compare these probabilities.

67% is greater than 66%, so according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred over Lottery B because it has a higher maximum probability.

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner: 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for the outcome of 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 3000 Euros). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
Lottery A has a maximum probability of 80%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%.

To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. The decision reason is based on the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be directly derived from the given information about the lotteries. Therefore, we can proceed with the application of the decision reason.

Next, we identify the maximum probability for each lottery:
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 80% (for the outcome of 0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 75% (for the outcome of 0 Euros).

Now, we apply the decision reason’s rule, which prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. Comparing the maximum probabilities:
- Lottery A's maximum probability (80%) is higher than Lottery B's maximum probability (75%).

Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred over Lottery B because it has a higher maximum probability.

To solve this decision problem using the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for the outcome of 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for the outcome of 3000 Euros). Since we can derive the relevant information (maximum probabilities) from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can apply the decision reason. The relevant information is:

To apply the decision reason to the given decision problem, we first need to assess if the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery, so we need to identify the maximum probability for each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (the probability of winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.8% (the probability of winning 0 Euros). 
Since we can derive this information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.
