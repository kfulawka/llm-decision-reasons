12,"smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. 
We can derive the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery from the given probabilities. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 75% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability, the second highest outcome is 2000 Euros with a 25% probability, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 50% probability.
The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. 
The relevant information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason is: 
Lottery A has a difference of 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros between the maximum and minimum outcome.
Lottery B has a difference of 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros between the maximum and second highest outcome, and 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros between the maximum outcome and the minimum outcome. However, in the spirit of this decision reason, it is the difference between the maximum and the minimum outcome that matters. So, Lottery B has a difference of 2000 - 0 = 2000 Euros between the second highest and minimum outcome, and 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros between the maximum and the minimum outcome. This gives 4000 as the relevant difference for the maximum and minimum outcome of Lottery B. 
Therefore, the relevant information is: 
Lottery A has a difference of 6000 Euros between the maximum and minimum outcome.
Lottery B has a difference of 4000 Euros between the maximum and minimum outcome.
