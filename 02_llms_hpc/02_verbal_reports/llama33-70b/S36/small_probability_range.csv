STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery A, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the small possibility of losing with Lottery B but also the chance of a slightly higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its potential for a higher gain despite a small risk of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly match the individual's consideration of the small possibility of losing and the chance of a higher gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the potential for a higher gain, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not align with the decision reason's rule, which prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report indicates the decision was based on the potential for a higher gain and the small risk of losing, not on the differences in probability ranges. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, so the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 34% = 32%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in probability ranges for each lottery, which are 34% for Lottery A and 32% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the winning possibilities of both lotteries to be nearly equal and noted that the potential gain from Lottery A was higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the similarity in winning chances and the difference in potential winnings, without explicitly mentioning the probability differences between the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (similarity in winning chances and difference in potential winnings): The individual does not seem to have explicitly considered the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the similarity in winning chances and the higher potential gain of Lottery A): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there's no mention of comparing the differences in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries or used this criterion to make their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% for both minimum and maximum, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery B: Difference = 60%
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that the win in Lottery A was guaranteed.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win was guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries, while the individual focused on the guarantee of winning in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 0%. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was because the win was guaranteed, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's decision to choose Lottery A aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (since Lottery A has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries as the reason for the choice. Instead, it focuses on the guarantee of the win. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability (of winning nothing) is 10%, and the maximum probability (of winning) is 90%. The difference is 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability (of winning nothing) is 55%, and the maximum probability (of winning) is 45%. The difference is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning with Lottery A being greater.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about the higher possibility of winning with Lottery A, which implies a focus on the probability of the positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the higher possibility of winning, which does not directly address the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 10% difference. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the higher winning probability of Lottery A, not directly on the difference between the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the higher winning probability of Lottery A and not on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries suggests that the decision reason considering these probability differences was not used. The verbal report does not indicate any consideration of the specific rule provided by the decision reason, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, making the difference 99.6%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, making the difference 99.8%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the winning probability and the potential winnings, noting that the winning probabilities were nearly identical.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the potential win was higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which was not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the winning probability being nearly identical and the potential winnings.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (99.6% difference vs. 99.8% for Lottery B). However, the individual chose Lottery B because of the higher potential win, not because of the probability differences.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery B has a 60% difference in probabilities, and Lottery A has a 0% difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery B, implying they looked at the outcomes and their associated probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a chance to lose nothing, which directly relates to the 20% probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the chance of not losing anything, which relates to the outcomes rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, so the difference is 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, so the difference is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (80% for A and 10% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing anything (which translates to the probability of not losing, i.e., the probability of the 0 Euros outcome) in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the perceived higher chance of not losing (or a misunderstanding of the statement, as Lottery A has a higher chance of not losing, but the statement seems to imply Lottery B was chosen due to a higher chance of not losing, which is incorrect based on the probabilities given).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned or implied in the verbal report. The individual seems to focus on the chance of not losing, which is related to the specific outcomes and their probabilities but not directly to the difference between the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 10%). However, the individual's justification as provided does not clearly align with this rule, especially since the statement about the chance of not losing is misinterpreted or misstated regarding the choice made.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery or that this difference played a role in their decision-making process. The justification provided in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason’s rule, suggesting that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
10,"SESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002), with a difference of 0.002. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001), with a difference of 0.001. 
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the chance of losing (which can be interpreted as the probability of losing) and the amount that would be lost in each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by noting that the chance to lose was nearly the same, but the amount that would be lost was smaller in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the chance of losing (probability) and the amount that would be lost, not explicitly the difference in probabilities. 
However, the individual's consideration of the probability of losing being ""nahezu gleich"" (nearly the same) implies an awareness of the probability aspect, though not directly comparing the range of probabilities. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B in this case (0.001 vs 0.002 for Lottery A), but the individual's justification is based on the amount lost being smaller in Lottery A, not directly on the probability differences. 
Based on these comparisons, the individual does not directly apply the decision reason as described, focusing instead on the amount lost and the similarity in the chance of losing, rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the win possibility of Lottery A, noting it was at 100%.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the justification but highlights the certainty of winning with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty (100% win possibility) of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification implicitly prefers the certainty of Lottery A, but does not explicitly discuss the probability differences between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the certainty of Lottery A aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A due to its smaller probability difference), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the probability differences between the lotteries as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment, it's uncertain and not explicitly stated that the decision reason was the basis for the choice, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% (with an implicit 0% for any other outcome), so the difference is also considered in the context of the decision reason, which would technically be 100% - 0% = 100%. However, given the nature of the reason, it seems to focus on the range of probabilities within each lottery's possible outcomes. Thus, the relevant information for Lottery A is a difference of 0% (since both outcomes have the same probability), and for Lottery B, it's about having a single certain outcome, implying no range. This simplifies the comparison to the presence of a range in probabilities for Lottery A (which is 0%) versus no range for Lottery B but a guaranteed loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of losing a high amount (50% in Lottery A) and preferred a smaller, guaranteed loss (Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on preferring a guaranteed smaller loss over a 50% chance of a larger loss, indicating a risk-averse attitude.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, while the individual considered the risk of high loss versus a guaranteed smaller loss. The individual's focus aligns more with the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would technically align with Lottery A (since its difference is 0%). However, the individual's justification is about avoiding a high potential loss, not directly about the range of probabilities within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The decision reason provided focuses on the range of probabilities within each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B based on avoiding a high potential loss. The individual's reasoning is more aligned with risk aversion rather than the specific decision reason given. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (for 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and 50% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 50%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for 6000 Euros) and 75% (for 0 Euros), making the minimum probability 25% and the maximum probability 75%. The difference is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Felder Aufgedeckt"" which translates to ""fields revealed"" or ""options revealed,"" and ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit bei Lotterie A war höher,"" which translates to ""the probability of winning at Lottery A was higher."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by mentioning a higher probability of winning at Lottery A, but this does not directly relate to the decision reason that focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires an analysis of the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual talks about the probability of winning being higher at Lottery A, not directly addressing the probability differences within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the overall probability of winning at Lottery A being higher, not on comparing the internal probability ranges of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery to make their decision. The verbal report does not directly support the use of this specific decision reason.

First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing anything (i.e., the probability of not incurring a loss).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a higher chance of not losing anything (nichts zu verlieren), implying they focused on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration was about the chance of not losing, which relates to the specific outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly address the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (25% difference) over Lottery B (50% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (higher chance of not losing), not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the chance of not losing anything, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since the verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probability differences as per the decision reason, and the choice was made based on a different criterion, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 99.8%
- Lottery B: Difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning in each lottery, specifically mentioning that the possibility of winning was highest in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the higher possibility of winning in Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning the comparison of probability differences between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the possibility of winning being highest in Lottery B, which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (since Lottery B has a 0% difference and thus would be preferred) but does not directly discuss the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the higher possibility of winning, not explicitly on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not explicitly discuss the comparison of probability differences, which is central to the decision reason. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% for one outcome, so the difference is 0% (since there's only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing anything, which was ""fast garantiert"" (almost guaranteed) in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification for choosing Lottery B was the high chance of not losing anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on the chance of not losing anything, not on comparing probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (0% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it with the high chance of not losing, not with the comparison of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on the guarantee of not losing money and the lack of discussion about probability differences indicate that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probability are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is also 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A offered a guaranteed win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win was guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is 0% for both. However, the individual's consideration was about the guarantee of the win in Lottery A, not explicitly about the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose Lottery A because it was guaranteed, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (guaranteed win) does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same probability difference of 0%, but the individual's choice was based on the guarantee of the win, not the comparison of probability ranges. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that all fields were uncovered (""Alle Felder aufgedeckt""), which implies they considered the full information about both lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed win (""garantierter Gewinn""), indicating they focused on the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the guaranteed nature of one of the lotteries, which relates to the probability but not directly to the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, this reason would not differentiate between them. The individual's justification, based on the guaranteed win, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0% as well. However, since Lottery A has a fixed outcome with 100% probability, it can be argued that its minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, still resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability ranges of both lotteries, which are [50%, 50%] for Lottery B and [100%, 100%] for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing with Lottery B and the guaranteed win with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a secure win, avoiding the potential loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probability differences) with that considered by the individual (possibility of loss and guaranteed win): The individual's considerations do not directly mention or imply comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding loss and securing a win): The individual's justification does not explicitly or implicitly mention the decision reason's rule about probability differences. The focus was on the avoidance of loss and the security of the win, not on the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The report focuses on the avoidance of potential loss and the guarantee of a win, without mentioning or implying considerations about the probability ranges of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
20,"Bei Lotterie A gab es nichts zu gewinnen, daher wurde B gewählt.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is also 0%. However, since Lottery A has a fixed outcome and Lottery B has varying outcomes, the decision reason's preference can be determined by this calculation.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process as focusing on the fact that there was nothing to win with Lottery A, which led to the choice of Lottery B. The information considered by the individual is the presence or absence of potential winnings in Lottery A. The individual’s justification for the choice is based on the lack of potential gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (presence or absence of potential winnings), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the probabilities or their differences. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual’s justification (choosing based on the absence of potential gain in one lottery). Given that both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent, but the individual's choice was based on a different criterion.
