0,"weight increased by 10 percentage points than their objective probability. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason can be applied as it involves comparing the outcomes and their probabilities. We need to adjust the probabilities of outcomes with less than 20% probability and then calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery.

* Lottery A:
	+ 2500 Euros with 33% probability
	+ 2400 Euros with 66% probability
	+ 0 Euros with 1% probability (adjusted to 11% due to the decision reason)
* Lottery B:
	+ 2400 Euros with 100% probability

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

* Calculate the weighted sum for Lottery A:
	+ Weighted sum = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.11) = 825 + 1584 + 0 = 2409 Euros
* Calculate the weighted sum for Lottery B:
	+ Weighted sum = 2400 * 1.00 = 2400 Euros

Since the weighted sum of Lottery A (2409 Euros) is greater than that of Lottery B (2400 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:**
   - The relevant information from the lotteries includes the outcomes and their probabilities.
   - Since all probabilities are less than 20% except for the 0 Euros outcome, the decision reason can be applied strictly.

   - **Lottery A:**
     - 2500 Euros with 33% probability
     - 0 Euros with 67% probability

   - **Lottery B:**
     - 2400 Euros with 34% probability
     - 0 Euros with 66% probability

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:**

   - Lottery A: 2500 Euros with 43% probability (33% + 10%)
   - Lottery B: 2400 Euros with 44% probability (34% + 10%)

   - Calculate the expected value for each lottery:
     - **Lottery A:**
       - Expected value = (2500 Euros * 0.43) + (0 Euros * 0.57)
       - Expected value = 1075 Euros

3,"% receive a weight increased by 10 percentage points than their objective probability. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason can be applied to the given decision problem. The relevant information that can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities are the probabilities and monetary outcomes for both lotteries. The decision reason specifies a rule for outcomes with a probability of less than 20%, which applies to the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery A and the 3000 Euros outcome in Lottery B.

Summarize the information about the lotteries relevant to the decision reason:

* Lottery A:
	+ 4000 Euros with 20% probability
	+ 0 Euros with 80% probability (weighted probability = 80% + 10% = 90%)
* Lottery B:
	+ 3000 Euros with 25% probability (weighted probability = 25% + 0% = 25%)
	+ 0 Euros with 75% probability

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

Calculate the sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities for each lottery:

* Lottery A:
	+ (4000 Euros * 20%) + (0 Euros * 90%) = 800 Euros
* Lottery B:
	+ (3000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 75%) = 750 Euros

Since 800 Euros > 750 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem**

The decision reason can be applied strictly as it involves only the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, which are provided. Let's summarize the relevant information:

- Lottery A:
  - -4000 Euros with 80% probability
  - 0 Euros with 20% probability
- Lottery B:
  - -3000 Euros with 100% probability

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem**

First, adjust the probabilities for outcomes with a probability of less than 20%:

- Lottery A:
  - -4000 Euros with 80% probability (no change)
  - 0 Euros with 30% probability (increased by 10 percentage points)
- Lottery B:
  - -3000 Euros with 100% probability (no change)

Next, calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery:

- Lottery A:
  - Weighted sum = (0.80 * -4000) + (0.30 * 0) = -3200 + 0 = -3200

- Lottery B:
  - Weighted sum = (1.00 * -3000) = -3000

7,"a weight increased by 10 percentage points than their objective probability. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason can be applied strictly because it relies only on the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries, which are provided. Let's summarize the relevant information:

- Lottery A:
  - -4000 Euros with 20% probability (weight = 20%)
  - 0 Euros with 80% probability (weight = 80%)

- Lottery B:
  - -3000 Euros with 25% probability (weight = 25% becomes 35% after increase)
  - 0 Euros with 75% probability (weight = 75%)

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

First, we adjust the probabilities according to the decision reason:

- Lottery A:
  - -4000 Euros with 20% probability (weight remains 20%)
  - 0 Euros with 80% probability (weight remains 80%)

- Lottery B:
  - -3000 Euros with 25% probability (weight becomes 35%)
  - 0 Euros with 75% probability (weight remains 75%)

Next, we calculate the weighted sum of outcomes for each lottery:

- Lottery A: (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800
- Lottery B: (-3000 * 0.35) + (0 * 0.75) = -1050

Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities, we compare the two:

- Lottery A: -800
- Lottery B: -1050

Lottery A has a more favorable (less negative) weighted sum.

9,"0 percentage points than their objective probability. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires information about the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries, which are provided. The decision reason can be applied strictly to the decision problem.
The relevant information about the lotteries is as follows:
- Lottery A: -6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
First, adjust the probabilities of the outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points.

For Lottery A:
- The probability of -6000 Euros is 0.1%, which is less than 20%. The adjusted probability is 0.1% + 10% = 10.1%.
- The probability of 0 Euros is 99.9%, which is not less than 20%. The adjusted probability remains 99.9%.

For Lottery B:
- The probability of -3000 Euros is 0.2%, which is less than 20%. The adjusted probability is 0.2% + 10% = 10.2%.
- The probability of 0 Euros is 99.8%, which is not less than 20%. The adjusted probability remains 99.8%.

Next, calculate the weighted sum of the outcomes for each lottery:
- Lottery A: (-6000 * 10.1%) + (0 * 99.9%) = -606 Euros
- Lottery B: (-3000 * 10.2%) + (0 * 99.8%) = -306 Euros

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities. Since -306 Euros is more favorable than -606 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

- For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability.
- For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability.

Since both probabilities in Lottery A are above 20%, we do not need to increase their weights. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so we do not need to adjust the weight.

2. Next, we need to adjust the probabilities of the outcomes with a probability of less than 20% by increasing their weight by 10 percentage points. Since there are no probabilities less than 20% in this case, the probabilities will remain the same.
