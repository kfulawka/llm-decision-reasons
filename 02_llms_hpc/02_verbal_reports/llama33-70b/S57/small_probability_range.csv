STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery B, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%.
For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (since there is only one probability).
The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 65% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report is very brief, stating ""sicherheit,"" which translates to ""safety"" or ""security"" in English. This implies the individual considered the certainty or reliability of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not explicitly state the justification but implies a preference for a secure or certain outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges, which relates to the variability or uncertainty of the outcomes. The individual's consideration of ""sicherheit"" can be related to preferring less variability or more certainty, which aligns with preferring a smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 0%. The individual's implied preference for ""sicherheit"" suggests they might prefer the more certain outcome, which is also Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, it seems plausible that the individual's consideration of safety or security could align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with less probability difference, but the verbal report is too brief and indirect to be certain.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% ( implicit, as 66% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 34% (for 2400 Euros), resulting in a difference of 34%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicit, as 67% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 33% (for 2500 Euros), resulting in a difference of 33%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities (34% for A and 33% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""ähnliche wahrscheinlichkeit"" which translates to ""similar probability"", indicating they considered the probabilities of the two lotteries. They also mention ""höherer gewinn möglich"" which translates to ""higher gain possible"", indicating they considered the potential gains (outcomes) of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the similarity in probabilities and the potential for higher gain, without explicitly discussing the difference in probability ranges.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of ""similar probability"" and ""higher gain possible"". The individual does not explicitly mention considering the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B with a 33% difference. The individual's justification does not explicitly align with this rule, as they do not discuss the preference based on the probability difference but rather on the similarity of probabilities and the potential for higher gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Their focus was on the similarity of probabilities and the potential for higher gain, not on the range of probabilities as required by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a 0% difference and Lottery B has a 60% difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report simply states ""sicherer gewinn,"" which translates to ""safer win"" or ""certain gain"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome. The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the certainty of winning, which aligns with the concept of probability. The individual's justification for the choice appears to be based on the desire for a certain or safer outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probability ranges for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the certainty of the outcome), there is an indirect alignment. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 0% difference, indicating a certain outcome. The individual's focus on a ""safer win"" also points towards preferring a certain outcome, which is consistent with the characteristics of Lottery A. The decision reason's rule (preferring the smaller difference in probabilities) and the individual's justification (preferring a certain gain) both lead to the selection of Lottery A, suggesting the decision reason might have been used.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment is based on the alignment between the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smaller probability difference (which aligns with the concept of a certain outcome) and the individual's stated preference for a ""safer win."" While the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing probability ranges, the focus on certainty indirectly supports the decision reason's criteria. However, the lack of direct mention of comparing probability differences introduces some uncertainty, preventing a 100% certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference is 75% - 25% = 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, so the difference is 80% - 20% = 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere gewinnchance,"" which translates to ""higher winning chance."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of winning for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about comparing the winning chances, implying the individual's focus was on which lottery offers a higher probability of winning, not directly on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the differences in probabilities within each lottery, but the individual's focus was on the ""higher winning chance,"" which doesn't directly align with calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification. The individual's justification is about higher winning chances, not about the spread of probabilities within each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 10% for the outcome of 0 Euros, but since 0 is the minimum possible outcome, we consider the probability of the other outcome, which is 90%, and its complement, 10%, is the minimum relevant probability for this calculation) and the maximum probability is 90%. The difference is 90% - 10% = 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% and the maximum probability is 55%. The difference is 55% - 45% = 10%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is: Lottery A has a difference of 80%, and Lottery B has a difference of 10%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report is ""hohe wahrscheinlichkeit auf gewinn,"" which translates to ""high probability of winning."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of winning (or gaining a positive outcome) in their deliberation process. The justification for the choice, as described, focuses on the high probability of winning, without explicitly mentioning the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the high probability of winning), it appears the individual focused on the general concept of probability but did not explicitly discuss the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual applied this specific rule. Instead, it suggests a more general consideration of the probability of winning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered probabilities, there is no clear indication they used the specific decision reason of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery to make their decision. The verbal report lacks direct evidence supporting the application of this rule, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.1% and 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.2% and 99.8%, so the difference is 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities (99.6% vs 99.8%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere wahrscheinlichkeit auf gewinn,"" which translates to ""higher probability of winning."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of winning for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not provide a detailed justification but implies that the probability of winning was a factor in the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the probability of winning. These are related but distinct, as the individual's focus is not explicitly on the difference between the probabilities but rather on the probability of winning itself.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual's justification, based on the probability of winning, does not directly align with this rule since it does not specify considering the difference between probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered the probability of winning, which is related to but does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The report lacks explicit mention of comparing the ranges of probabilities, which is central to the decision reason. Thus, while there's a vague connection, it's unlikely the individual used this specific decision reason to make their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery A, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which would be Lottery A in this case.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""chance auf gewinn,"" which translates to ""chance of winning"" in English. This phrase suggests the individual considered probabilities or chances related to the lotteries but does not specify which aspects of the probabilities (e.g., differences between them) were considered.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries. The mention of ""chance of winning"" is too vague to determine the specific factors influencing the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's report mentions considering the ""chance of winning,"" which could relate to probabilities but does not directly indicate a consideration of the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification is not clearly stated in terms of this rule or any other specific criteria related to probabilities.

Given the lack of clear information in the verbal report about the individual considering the specific differences between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, and the absence of a clear justification that aligns with the decision reason's rule, it's challenging to determine with certainty whether the decision reason was used.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference is 75% - 25% = 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, so the difference is 80% - 20% = 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""weniger verlust,"" which translates to ""less loss."" This suggests the individual considered the potential losses of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not explicitly state their justification but implies a preference for minimizing loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, while the individual seems to focus on minimizing loss. These are not directly related, as the individual does not mention considering the probabilities' differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% difference). The individual's justification, as far as can be discerned, is about minimizing loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it has a smaller loss (-3000 Euros vs. -4000 Euros) but does not directly relate to the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on ""weniger verlust"" (less loss) does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The decision reason and the individual's justification for the choice, as inferred from the verbal report, do not match, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% and the maximum probability is 55%, resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% and the maximum probability is 90%, resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 10% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""verlust minimieren,"" which translates to ""minimize loss."" This suggests the individual considered the potential losses associated with each lottery. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not provide explicit justification but implies a focus on reducing or minimizing losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, while the individual seems to focus on minimizing losses, which does not directly relate to the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery A with a 10% difference. The individual's justification, as inferred from ""verlust minimieren,"" does not directly align with this rule since it emphasizes loss minimization rather than probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on loss minimization does not necessarily translate to considering the difference in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringeres risiko,"" which translates to ""lower risk"" in English. This suggests the individual considered the risk aspect of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is minimal but implies that the choice was made based on a perception of risk, without explicitly stating how the risk was evaluated.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities as a measure of risk or uncertainty. The individual's mention of ""lower risk"" could relate to this, but it's not clear if they specifically considered the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Lottery A has a smaller difference (99.6%) compared to Lottery B (99.8%), so the reason would prefer Lottery A. The individual's justification of ""lower risk"" could align with preferring Lottery A if they perceived the smaller probability difference as lower risk, but this connection is not explicitly made.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report mentions ""lower risk,"" which could vaguely align with the concept of preferring smaller differences in probabilities as a measure of risk. However, the connection is not explicit, and the report lacks detail on how the individual evaluated risk or if they specifically considered the probability differences as the decision reason does. Therefore, while there's a slight possibility the decision reason was considered, it's largely uncertain and unlikely based on the information provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B because it has the smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report simply states ""sicherheit,"" which translates to ""safety"" or ""security"" in English. This suggests that the individual considered the aspect of certainty or risk when making their decision. The individual's justification for their choice is not explicitly stated beyond this single word, but it implies a focus on avoiding uncertainty or ensuring a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (safety or security), there seems to be an indirect connection. The concept of safety or security might relate to the preference for a guaranteed outcome, which aligns with Lottery B's 100% probability of winning 500 Euros. However, the report does not directly mention probabilities or their differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (sicherheit), there's a plausible but not direct connection. The individual's focus on security could imply a preference for the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B due to its smaller probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment indicates a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty. The individual's focus on ""sicherheit"" suggests a preference for certainty, which aligns with the characteristics of Lottery B preferred by the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well, since there's only one outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference in probabilities (0%), but this is derived from understanding the lotteries' structures.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the possibility of not losing, which aligns with avoiding the worst outcome in Lottery B (-1000 Euros) and the guaranteed loss in Lottery A (-500 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 99.8% difference
- Lottery B: 0% difference

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere wahrscheinlichkeit verlust zu umgehen,"" which translates to ""higher probability of avoiding loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement implies they are focusing on minimizing losses by choosing the option with a higher probability of avoiding a loss, but does not explicitly state how they weigh these probabilities against each other or compare the lotteries directly in terms of probability differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual seems to focus on avoiding loss, which relates to the probabilities but not explicitly to their differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities (which would be Lottery B), but the individual's justification is about avoiding loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery B (since it has a 0% chance of a larger loss like Lottery A's -5000 Euros), but the reasoning process described doesn't explicitly match the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the outcome chosen might align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B due to its 0% difference in probabilities), the reasoning process described by the individual focuses on avoiding loss rather than the specific probability differences, indicating the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference, and both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the information relevant to the decision reason can indeed be derived, but it suggests indifference according to the reason's rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is not explicitly detailed, but the phrase ""sicherer gewinn"" translates to ""safe win"" or ""certain gain"" in English, implying the individual considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to hinge on the idea of a ""safe win,"" which suggests they preferred the lottery that guarantees a positive outcome without risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the win), it seems the individual focused more on the certainty of the outcome rather than the probability differences between the lotteries' outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring a ""safe win""), the decision reason's rule does not directly align with the individual's stated justification since both lotteries have the same probability difference of 0%, and the individual's choice seems based on risk aversion rather than the specific probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 0%
- Lottery B: Difference = 0%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sicherer gewinn, kein risiko,"" which translates to ""safe win, no risk."" This indicates the individual considered the aspect of risk and the certainty of gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on avoiding risk and opting for a certain gain, without explicitly mentioning probabilities or the specific differences in probabilities between the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the difference in probabilities, which was found to be 0% for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the concept of ""no risk"" and ""safe win,"" which aligns more with the concept of certainty and risk aversion rather than explicitly comparing probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference for the safe option, which is Lottery B, due to its certainty.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process focused more on risk aversion and the desire for a certain outcome rather than explicitly considering the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries. The decision reason provided does not directly align with the individual's stated justification for choosing Lottery B, which was based on avoiding risk and securing a certain win.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, so the difference is also 0%. However, since Lottery B has only one outcome with 100% probability, it can be argued that the minimum and maximum probabilities are effectively the same, making the difference 0%. But for Lottery A, the reason would actually compare the range of probabilities (0% to 100% if we consider the implicit 0% chance of getting any other outcome), but given the provided probabilities, the difference is 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report is ""sicherer gewinn,"" which translates to ""safer win"" or ""secure win"" in English. This phrase suggests that the individual considered the certainty or security of the outcome. The individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the aspect of security or certainty of winning, which is implied by the phrase ""sicherer gewinn"". This phrase does not explicitly mention probabilities or their differences but implies a preference for a more secure or certain outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (security or certainty of winning), there seems to be an indirect relation. The decision reason is about the difference in probabilities, which is more about the spread or range of probabilities, while the individual's focus is on the security of the win, which aligns more with the concept of risk aversion or preference for certainty rather than directly comparing probability ranges. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0% when considering the provided probabilities, the reason would not differentiate between them based on this rule alone. However, the individual's justification for the choice, focusing on a ""safer win,"" suggests a preference for Lottery B, which offers a guaranteed win, aligning with the concept of minimizing risk or maximizing certainty, not directly with the decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is also 0% since there is only one probability value. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery, which is 0% for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states ""verlustvermeidung,"" which translates to ""loss aversion"" in English. This suggests that the individual considered avoiding losses as a key factor in their decision-making process. The information considered by the individual seems to focus on the potential for loss, and the justification for the choice appears to be based on avoiding negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (avoiding losses), it seems there is a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the probability differences, which are the same for both lotteries, while the individual's consideration is about avoiding losses. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), this reason would not lead to a preference for one lottery over the other based on the given probabilities alone. However, the individual's justification (loss aversion) does not directly relate to the probability differences but rather to the outcomes (gaining or losing money). Given this, it appears the decision reason about probability differences was not the primary factor in the individual's decision-making process.
