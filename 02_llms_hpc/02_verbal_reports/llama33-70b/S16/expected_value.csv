STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery B, the EV can be calculated as (2500*0.33) + (2400*0.66) + (0*0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. For Lottery A, the EV is 2400*1 = 2400 Euros. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report is brief and does not explicitly mention the outcomes, probabilities, or any calculations related to the lotteries. The phrase ""Siehe wie vorher beschrieben"" translates to ""See as previously described,"" which implies reference to information not provided in the report itself. The phrase ""Wissen ist einfach mehr"" translates to ""Knowledge is simply more,"" which does not directly relate to the calculation of expected values or comparison of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the individual’s justification is not clearly provided, it's challenging to directly compare it with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value.
Given these comparisons, the verbal report lacks explicit information about considering expected values or comparing them to make a decision, which are crucial for the decision reason in question.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The EV of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (the expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the difference in probability (""1% mehr"") and its potential to result in a win, indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the slightly higher probability of winning in one of the lotteries, without explicitly mentioning the outcomes or calculating expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which involve both outcomes and probabilities. The individual focuses on the probability difference but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning, not explicitly on the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability difference without mention of expected values or outcomes suggests they did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. While there is a slight indication of considering a factor (probability) that is part of the decision reason, the core of the decision reason (comparing expected values) is not reflected in the verbal report. Thus, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a minor consideration of a relevant factor."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, where EV = (outcome * probability). For Lottery A, the EV is 3000 * 1 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring to know exactly what they will get (100% certainty) rather than facing uncertainty and the possibility of losing. This indicates they considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A and the uncertainty associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their preference based on the desire for certainty and avoiding the risk of losing, not directly mentioning expected values or the specific monetary outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (certainty vs. uncertainty and risk of loss): The individual does not explicitly mention considering the expected monetary values of the lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preference for certainty over uncertainty): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on risk aversion rather than comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. Instead, their choice seems to be influenced by a preference for certainty and risk aversion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (4000 Euros * 20%) + (0 Euros * 80%) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 75%) = 750 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived and summarized as follows: Lottery A has an expected value of 800 Euros, and Lottery B has an expected value of 750 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that ""B sah einfach besser von der Wahrscheinlichkeit aus,"" which translates to ""B simply looked better in terms of probability."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided focuses on the probability aspect, suggesting that the individual's decision was influenced by how the probabilities of the two lotteries compared, without explicitly mentioning the outcomes or the expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities). The individual's consideration was on probabilities, not directly on expected values, which are the basis of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (probability making one option look better). The decision reason and the individual's justification do not align because the decision reason is based on expected value, while the individual's justification is based on probability without considering the monetary outcomes.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated as EV = (Outcome * Probability). For Lottery A, EV_A = (3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV_B = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the probabilities of each lottery, specifically mentioning that the probabilities for Lottery A were more attractive than those for Lottery B because the probabilities for B were too close together.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the comparative attractiveness of the probabilities rather than the expected monetary outcomes or values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which were not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focused on the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of the probabilities, not the expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report indicates that the individual's decision was based on the perceived attractiveness of the probabilities rather than a calculation or consideration of the expected values of the lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on comparing the expected values of the lotteries, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 6 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the perceived better probability, mentioning a difference of 0.1% as significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probability rather than the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning, not the expected value. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would lead to indifference, but the individual's justification does not align with calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied by calculating the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is -3000 Euros (since -3000 Euros with 100% probability). For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, indicating Lottery A has a higher expected value (-3000 Euros) than Lottery B (-3200 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing with both lotteries but noted a small chance of not losing anything with Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to value the small chance of not losing anything with Lottery B, indicating that the attempt (or chance) is worth it, implying a focus on the potential upside or avoidance of a certain loss rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual: The individual's considerations do not directly mention expected values or a comparison of the overall expected outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the chance of not losing and the value of that chance, rather than explicitly preferring the lottery with the higher expected value.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. The verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the expected values of the lotteries or a preference based on these values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. 
For Lottery B: EV = (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros.
For Lottery A: EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The expected value of Lottery A (-750 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (-800 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions relying on the 80% probability, which refers to the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual wanted to rely on the high probability (80%) of getting nothing, implying a preference for avoiding loss with higher certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of getting 0 Euros in one of the lotteries): The individual focuses on the probability aspect rather than calculating or comparing expected values directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (relying on the high probability of not getting a loss): The individual's justification does not directly mention or imply a comparison of expected values between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries to make the decision. The individual's focus was more on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than on the overall expected value of each lottery.

The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -2700 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high probability of losing in Lottery A, which implies they considered the probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement suggests they were concerned about the risk or the probability of losing, specifically mentioning the high probability of losing in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of losing in Lottery A): The individual's focus was on the probability of losing rather than the expected value of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (concern about the probability of losing): The decision reason's rule is based on expected value, whereas the individual's justification is based on the perceived risk or probability of a negative outcome, not directly on the expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of the product of each outcome and its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss amount, comparing the 6000 Euros potential loss in Lottery A to the 3000 Euros potential loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus was on the amount of money that could be lost, indicating a concern for the potential downside of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, while the individual considered the potential loss amounts. Although related, these are not the same, as the expected value calculation also considers the probability of the outcomes, not just the magnitude of the potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on the potential loss, which does not directly align with the expected value calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the potential loss amount and the verbal report's content do not align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. The decision reason would lead to indifference due to equal expected values, but the individual's justification is based on a different aspect (potential loss), indicating the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 * 1) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both Lotterie A (50% chance of getting money or nothing) and Lotterie B (100% chance of getting money).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lotterie B because it offered a 100% chance of getting money, implying a preference for certainty over the uncertainty of Lotterie A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and certainty of outcomes): The individual focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lotterie B rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prefer the lottery with a 100% chance of getting money): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the expected value but does indicate a preference for the certain outcome, which in this case coincidentally aligns with one of the lotteries having a higher or equal expected value (since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report suggests that the decision was based on the certainty of the outcome rather than an explicit comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value to make a decision, and the individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply the calculation or comparison of expected values, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is calculated as: (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is -500 Euros with 100% probability, so it is also -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of 1000 Euros in Lottery A and the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found the certain loss of 500 Euros more attractive than the potential loss of 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, which are -500 Euros for both. The individual considered the potential losses, which aligns with the idea of evaluating outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. However, since both lotteries have the same expected value (-500 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, indicates a preference for the certain loss (Lottery B) over the potential larger loss (Lottery A), which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of choosing based on expected value, especially since the expected values are equal.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated using the formula EV = (outcome1 * probability1) + (outcome2 * probability2) +.... For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to acknowledge the division of probabilities and outcomes in the lotteries, mentioning that the last two options combined give a 50% chance of winning something. This suggests the individual is considering the structure of the lotteries but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not provide a clear justification for choosing one lottery over the other based on the expected value or any other explicit criterion. The statement seems to focus on the probability of winning something rather than the monetary value of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses probabilities and the potential for winning but does not directly address the expected monetary outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the verbal report does not provide a justification that aligns with this rule. The individual’s focus is more on the existence of winning probabilities rather than their monetary value.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make the decision. However, the report is brief and does not fully articulate the decision-making process, leaving some uncertainty.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of losing in both lotteries, specifically focusing on the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the perceived risk of losing, stating that the risk with Lottery B was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating expected values based on all outcomes and their probabilities, while the individual focused on the risk of losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the risk of losing, not on comparing expected values.

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is (5000 Euros * 0.001) + (0 Euros * 0.999) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5 Euros * 1) = 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the amount in Lottery B compared to Lottery A, mentioning that the amount in B was ""zu 100% sicherer"" (100% safer/certain) than in A. This indicates the individual focused on the probability aspect, specifically the certainty of receiving a payout in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by highlighting the 100% certainty of receiving a payout in Lottery B, despite the amount being small (""der Betrag bei B sehr gering war""). This suggests the individual's decision was influenced by the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are equal for both lotteries. However, the individual's focus was on the certainty of the payout rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent between them. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the certainty of the payout in Lottery B, not the expected value.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the expected value decision reason to make their decision. Instead, they were swayed by the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities provided. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is -5 Euros with 100% probability, so EV = -5 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss in both lotteries and their personal luck, focusing on the certainty of loss in Lottery B and the high potential loss in Lottery A despite its low probability.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on feeling safer with Lottery B due to the smaller, certain loss compared to the larger, though less likely, loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of loss, personal luck, and comparative loss amounts): The individual's considerations do not directly mention or imply the calculation or comparison of expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (feeling safer with the smaller, certain loss): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the perceived safety of a certain outcome rather than the expected value.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the 100% chance of getting 1500 Euros in Lottery A and the uncertainty of getting 3000 Euros in Lottery B. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers the certain outcome of 1500 Euros over the uncertain outcome of possibly getting 3000 Euros, indicating a preference for certainty over potential higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and uncertainty in Lottery B). While the individual does not explicitly mention expected values, their focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A implies an understanding that the guaranteed 1500 Euros is preferable to the gamble. Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring certainty). The individual's justification aligns with the outcome of the decision reason, as Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B, but the individual's reasoning is based on certainty rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's outcome (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value), the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. The individual's justification is more focused on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected monetary value, suggesting that the decision reason might have influenced the choice indirectly but was not the primary, explicitly stated reason for the decision."

Verbal report:
Auch hier wieder zu wissen, dass man Safe gewinnt auch wenn es 1000€ weniger ist. Ist immerhin besser als es nicht zu wissen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived, and it suggests that Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery A, even if it's less than what could be won with Lottery B. The individual mentions the preference for a ""Safe win"" (""Safe gewinnt""), indicating consideration of the risk aspect.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on the preference for certainty and the avoidance of uncertainty or potential loss, as indicated by ""ist immerhin besser als es nicht zu wissen"" (""is at least better than not knowing"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning, avoidance of uncertainty), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual does consider the aspect of certainty, which is related to the expected value in the sense that a certain gain (Lottery A) has a higher expected value than a risky option with the same or lower expected value (Lottery B).
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (preference for certainty and known outcomes), there's an indirect alignment. The individual's justification can be seen as consistent with preferring a higher expected value, given that the certain option (Lottery A) indeed has a higher expected value than the risky option (Lottery B).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects a leaning towards the decision reason being used but acknowledges that the verbal report does not explicitly mention expected values or a direct comparison of the lotteries based on this criterion. The individual's focus on certainty and avoidance of uncertainty indirectly supports the decision reason, given the characteristics of the lotteries presented. However, the lack of explicit mention of expected values or a direct comparison based on this criterion prevents a full certainty assessment."

Hier liegt die Antwort ja klar auf der Hand. Wer möchte nicht zu 100% Wahrscheinlichkeit wissen, dass man bei B Safe nur gewinnt!

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 1) = 1000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, indicating that Lottery B has a higher expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 100% probability of winning with Lottery B, indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome for Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of winning with Lottery B (""zu 100% Wahrscheinlichkeit wissen, dass man bei B Safe nur gewinnt""), implying that the certainty of the positive outcome was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Instead, the individual focuses on the certainty of the outcome for Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual chooses Lottery B but justifies this choice based on the certainty of winning, not explicitly on the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the expected value to make their decision, as they focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculated expected values of the lotteries. While the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided does not explicitly mention expected value calculations, suggesting that the decision reason might not have been the primary basis for the individual's choice."

Bei 50/50 Chancen sehe ich mich irgendwie nicht so Risiko bereit.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (0 * 1) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the two lotteries. Both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""50/50 Chancen"" (50/50 chances), which refers to the probability of the outcomes in Lottery B. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states ""ich sehe mich irgendwie nicht so Risiko bereit"" (I don't see myself as willing to take the risk somehow), which implies the individual is risk-averse and prefers to avoid risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, but the individual's verbal report focuses on the risk aspect and the 50/50 probability, without explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on risk aversion, not on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values to make the decision, which is the core of the decision reason. Instead, the report highlights a focus on risk aversion, which is not the basis for the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
