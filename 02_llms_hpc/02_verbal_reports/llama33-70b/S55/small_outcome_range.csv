STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of 100 Euros more in Lottery A, the risk of winning nothing in Lottery A, and the guaranteed 2400 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential extra 100 Euros in Lottery A did not outweigh the risk of getting nothing, and thus preferred the guaranteed amount of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual considered the risk of winning nothing (which relates to the minimum outcome) and the potential for a higher gain (related to the maximum outcome), but the comparison of these outcomes as per the decision reason is not explicitly mentioned.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification indirectly aligns with this by preferring the guaranteed amount due to the risk associated with Lottery A, but does not explicitly state a preference based on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B due to its lack of risk, which correlates with having the smallest difference between maximum and minimum outcomes), the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the smaller difference. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The difference in Lottery A is 2400 Euros, and in Lottery B, it is 2500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in possible winnings between Lottery A and B, noting it was only 100 Euros, and the probability of winning in Lottery A being 1% higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the slightly lower maximum win, the chance of winning was higher by 1%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, considered the difference in the maximum outcomes (100 Euros difference) and the difference in probabilities, not directly the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason dictates.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (2400 Euros difference vs. 2500 Euros for B). However, the individual's justification was based on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A and the relatively small difference in potential winnings, not explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. While the individual did choose Lottery A, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the justification provided in the verbal report does not indicate that this choice was made based on the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment of the choice with the reason's preference."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros from Lottery B and weighs it against the risk of potentially gaining more (4000 Euros) or less (0 Euros) from Lottery A. They mention the potential regret of ending up with 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the certain gain over the risk of a higher potential gain due to the fear of ending up with nothing and the subsequent regret.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considers the risk of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) in Lottery A and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the range of outcomes, though they don't explicitly state calculating the difference.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (0 difference). The individual prefers Lottery B due to the certainty it offers and the avoidance of potential regret from the minimum outcome of Lottery A, which indirectly suggests a preference for the smaller range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B due to its certainty and the avoidance of regret from potentially receiving the minimum outcome of Lottery A aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcome. While the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention the difference between the outcomes, their reasoning reflects a preference for the option that the decision reason would also prefer, based on the implicit consideration of outcome ranges. Thus, it is likely, but not certain, that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (1000 Euros more in Lottery A) and the difference in probabilities (5% less chance of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by weighing the potential higher gain against the slightly lower probability of winning, finding the potential for an additional 1000 Euros to be worth the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the primary consideration. The individual focused more on the difference in potential winnings and the trade-off with probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (3000 Euros difference) over Lottery A (4000 Euros difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A based on a different rationale (the potential for an additional 1000 Euros being worth the slightly lower probability of winning).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The verbal report indicates that the individual's decision was based on a trade-off between potential winnings and probabilities, not on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher potential gain of Lottery B, the risk involved, and the higher probability of winning with Lottery A, along with the amount that could be won (3000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring a safer option (Lottery A) due to its higher probability of winning, despite the lower maximum gain compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. While the individual did consider the outcomes (implicitly discussing the maximum gain of each lottery), they primarily focused on the risk, the probability of winning, and the specific amounts that could be won, rather than explicitly comparing the ranges of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery A (3000 Euros difference vs. 6000 Euros for Lottery B). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on playing it safe and having a higher chance of winning, which aligns with preferring a more predictable outcome but does not explicitly mention comparing the outcome ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes. However, the outcome of their decision (preferring Lottery A) coincidentally matches what the decision reason would suggest. The verbal report emphasizes risk aversion and the appeal of a higher probability of winning rather than the specific differences in outcome ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, their stated reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries and compared the potential winnings, noting that the higher potential win (6000 Euros) comes with a slightly lower probability (0.1% vs. 0.2% for the lower win of 3000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the lottery with the higher potential win (6000 Euros), despite its lower probability, because the difference in probabilities (""0,1% mehr machen den Braten auch nicht fett"") was deemed insignificant, and the potential for a higher win was more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the potential winnings and their probabilities, not the differences between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A, based on the justification that the higher potential win outweighed the slightly lower probability, not based on the differences between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not considered in the individual's justification. Instead, the individual focuses on the potential winnings and their probabilities, leading to a choice that contradicts the decision reason's preference. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the magnitude of the loss in Lottery A and the possibility of not losing anything in Lottery B. They compare their current decision to a previous one where they lost a smaller amount (5€), indicating they are considering the magnitude of losses and the presence of risk in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because, despite the potential for a greater loss, there's a chance they might not lose anything. This suggests the individual is motivated by the possibility of avoiding loss entirely, rather than the magnitude of the potential loss alone.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. While the individual does consider outcomes, their focus is more on the presence of risk (chance to lose nothing) and the magnitude of potential losses rather than the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes per se.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (difference of 0 Euros). However, the individual chooses Lottery B, citing the chance to avoid loss as their reason, not the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes, which is Lottery A, but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the chance to avoid any loss, not on comparing the ranges of outcomes between the two lotteries. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the potential loss (more money can be lost in Lottery B) and the probability of loss (5% lower probability in Lottery B).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is based on the trade-off between the potential loss and the probability of loss, specifically mentioning that the 5% lower probability in Lottery B was more convincing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (potential loss and probability of loss). The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (based on the trade-off between potential loss and probability of loss). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it focuses on the probability and potential loss rather than the difference between outcomes.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since the outcome is a loss, it's considered as a negative number, but in the context of ""maximum"" loss, it's the least negative) and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both lotteries and the amount of potential loss. They noted the high probability of losing in Lottery B (90%) and the fact that Lottery A has a nearly 50/50 chance of either losing or not losing (in terms of staying at 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of its nearly 50/50 chance of not losing (staying at 0 Euros), despite acknowledging the potential loss in Lottery A is twice as high as in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's justification focuses more on the probabilities of losing and the comparative risks rather than explicitly discussing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (difference of 3000 Euros) over Lottery A (difference of 6000 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery A, based on the probability of the outcome being 0 Euros, not explicitly on the difference between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B, but the individual chose Lottery A based on different criteria (probability of not losing). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, Lottery A has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcome compared to Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of the loss and compares the potential losses of the two lotteries, focusing on the fact that the worst-case loss in Lottery A is half of that in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because, despite the slightly higher risk of a loss, the worst-case scenario involves losing only half as much as in Lottery B, highlighting the significant difference in potential losses between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual also considers the difference in potential losses (maximum negative outcomes) between the two lotteries, which aligns with the decision reason's focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a smaller worst-case loss compared to Lottery B, which aligns with preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritize the lottery with the smaller difference between its worst-case and best-case scenarios.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery B and the certainty of gaining a good sum with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the certain gain over the risk of losing, indicating a preference for avoiding a potential large loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk and the certainty of the outcomes, which aligns with thinking about the range of possible outcomes (maximum and minimum) for each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which is Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding the risk of a large loss, which is consistent with preferring a lottery with a smaller range of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason, as they preferred the lottery with the more certain outcome (and by extension, the smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -500 Euros, since the outcome is certain, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery B has a difference of 1000 Euros, and Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery B and the certain loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they did not want to accept the certain loss of Lottery A, highlighting the potential to land on 0 Euros in Lottery B as a factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more about the potential to avoid a loss and the certainty of the outcomes rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it with the possibility of avoiding a loss, not the range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus was on avoiding a certain loss and the potential benefit of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery B. This does not align with the decision reason provided, which prefers the lottery based on the smallest range of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a maximum-minimum difference of 4000 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum-minimum difference of 6000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher potential gain (Gewinnsumme) and the lower probability of winning (Gewinnchance) when choosing between the lotteries. They also considered their personal tendency to either take risks or play it safe. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because its potential gain was significantly higher compared to Lottery A, despite the lower probability of winning. They overcame their inclination to play it safe due to the substantial difference in potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual. The individual instead focused on the potential gain and the probability of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher potential gain, not the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -2000 Euros (since it's the least negative among the outcomes) and the minimum outcome is also -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2000 Euros (considering the actual minimum and maximum relevant outcomes for the decision, the calculation should reflect the difference between the least negative and most negative, which is between -2000 and -4000, thus 2000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher chance of losing money in Lottery B but focused on the potential loss, mentioning that they would lose less with Lottery B compared to the potential loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating they preferred losing less (implying the smaller loss in Lottery B was more appealing), even though they felt their decision was somewhat random.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual considered the aspect of losing less, which aligns with preferring a smaller difference between outcomes, as the decision reason suggests.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's justification implicitly aligns with this, as they preferred Lottery B because the potential loss was less severe, reflecting a concern for the range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's focus on the difference between outcomes and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B based on the potential for less severe loss. However, the individual's comment about deciding ""total random"" introduces some uncertainty, preventing a perfect score of 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 5 Euros (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the certainty of winning 5 Euros in Lottery B. They also mention a previous lottery experience where they lost 5 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B to recover 5 Euros from a previous loss and because the chance of winning in Lottery A was very low, making the certain 5 Euros more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. They focused more on the probability of winning and the certainty of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (0 Euros difference). The individual's justification, however, is based on recovering a previous loss and the certainty of the outcome, not directly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. The focus on probability, certainty, and personal loss recovery does not indicate the use of the specified decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B. The relevant information for this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery A, even though the chance is small, and compared it to losing 5 Euros in Lottery B. They also mentioned their past experiences with lotteries and games of chance, indicating they have not been very successful.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by stating that losing 5 Euros would not hurt as much as potentially losing 5000 Euros, implying a consideration of the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. While the individual does consider the potential losses (minimum outcomes) of both lotteries, they do not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which aligns with choosing Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to choosing Lottery B but is based on the perceived pain of losing a large amount versus a small amount, rather than explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's decision process and justification align with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (choosing Lottery B), but the explicit consideration and comparison of the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as required by the decision reason are not clearly described in the verbal report. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual, leading to a score below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the aspect of gaining a ""sichere gute Summe Geld"" (a secure good sum of money) without taking a high risk. This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome and the risk involved in each lottery.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification focuses on avoiding risk to gain a secure sum of money, highlighting the attractiveness of a certain outcome over a risky one, even if the risky option has a potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which directly relates to the concept of risk (as the larger the difference, the higher the risk). The individual's focus on avoiding risk and preferring a secure outcome aligns with considering the implications of these differences, even if not explicitly stated in terms of maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its secure nature, which indirectly reflects a preference for the smaller risk profile, aligning with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the individual used a reasoning process aligned with the decision reason, as their focus on security and risk avoidance implicitly considers the differences in outcome ranges between the two lotteries, even if not explicitly framed in those terms. However, it is not a perfect match since the individual does not directly mention comparing the outcome ranges, hence not a 100% certainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the possibility of winning a higher sum with Lottery B, but also acknowledges the risk of losing money. This indicates that the individual is aware of the potential outcomes of both lotteries. 
Second, the individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by mentioning that the winning sum is secure and that 2000 Euros is a decent amount. This suggests that the individual values the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the possibility of winning or losing with Lottery B and the certainty of the outcome with Lottery A), we see that the individual's consideration of the risk of losing with Lottery B implies an awareness of the range of outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring Lottery A because the winning sum is secure), we find that the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it has no risk of loss (implying a preference for a smaller range of outcomes) aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and the individual's consideration of risk and preference for a secure outcome. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual's justification focuses more on the security of the outcome rather than explicitly stating a preference for the smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery A and the 50/50 chance of either gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros from Lottery B. They also mentioned their past luck with lotteries, which seems to influence their perception of risk.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to prefer the certain gain of 1000 Euros because they are concerned about losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B, given the 50/50 probability. Their past experiences with lotteries and the risk of loss in Lottery B appear to be significant factors in their deliberation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did not explicitly mention the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a factor in their decision. They focused more on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A and their fear of losing in Lottery B.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice, while the individual did choose Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason’s preference due to its smaller outcome difference, their justification was based on the certainty of the gain and fear of loss rather than the explicit consideration of outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery A), but their justification and the factors they considered (certainty of gain, fear of loss, and past luck) do not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. Thus, while there is a superficial alignment in the choice made, the underlying reasoning process described in the verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of 6000 Euros from Lottery B and the risk of losing 6000 Euros. They also considered the safety of choosing Lottery A, which offers 0 Euros with certainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B was the fear of taking a risk and losing a significant amount of money, indicating a preference for the safer option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. However, the individual's concern about the risk (implied by the potential loss of 6000 Euros) indirectly relates to the range of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's preference for the safer option (Lottery A) due to its lack of risk (0 Euros with 100% probability). The individual's justification, while not directly referencing the difference between outcomes, implies a preference for avoiding large potential losses, which aligns with preferring a lottery with a smaller range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The verbal report does not directly mention the decision reason's criteria (difference between maximum and minimum outcomes), but the individual's preference for avoiding risk and choosing the safer option indirectly aligns with the decision reason's rule. This suggests that while the decision reason might have influenced the decision, it was not explicitly considered as described. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but without clear, direct evidence."
