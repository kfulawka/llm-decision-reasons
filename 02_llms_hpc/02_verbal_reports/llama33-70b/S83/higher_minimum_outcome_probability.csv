STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 1% probability. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed high amount in Lottery A, the potential for a slightly higher amount in Lottery B, and the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B. They also considered the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by noting the guaranteed high amount in Lottery A, the minimal difference in potential winnings between the lotteries, and the security of Lottery A compared to the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual discussed the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B and the guaranteed amount in Lottery A, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the security and guarantee of Lottery A, implying a preference for the certain outcome over the risk of Lottery B, which indirectly suggests considering the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment is based on the individual's consideration of the guaranteed outcome in Lottery A and the risk of the minimum outcome in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which prevents a 100% certainty that the decision reason was used. Nonetheless, the emphasis on security and the guaranteed amount in Lottery A suggests a strong alignment with the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 66%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 67%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries are almost the same in terms of amounts and chances, but mentions that Lottery B offers a slightly higher potential win at almost the same chance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the potential win and the similarity in chances between the two lotteries, rather than explicitly discussing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which are 66% for Lottery A and 67% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discusses the similarity in chances and the potential higher win in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (67% chance of 0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, seems to lean towards choosing Lottery B based on its higher potential win at nearly the same chance, not directly addressing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus in the report is on the similarity of the lotteries and the higher potential win of Lottery B, rather than the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
3,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability.
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 20% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A (""Bei A gewinnt man auf jeden Fall""), the high chance of winning and the higher amount in Lottery B (""Bei B ist die Chance für einen Gewinn zwar sehr hoch und der Betrag höher als bei A""), and the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B (""aber dafür gibt es auch eine nicht ganz so kleine Chance, nichts zu erhalten"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the difference in winnings is not so large (""Der Unterschied der Gewinnbeträge ist nicht so groß"") and preferred to play it safe (""Dann lieber sicher gehen"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with 100% probability of its minimum outcome (3000 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (""Dann lieber sicher gehen"") suggests a preference for the guaranteed outcome, which is consistent with preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of the guaranteed win in Lottery A and the preference for playing it safe due to the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. This suggests a strong alignment between the decision reason and the individual's decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with an 80% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a 75% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which are 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that with neither lottery can one lose money, implying they recognize the minimum outcomes are 0 Euros for both. They also mention that the probability of winning is approximately equally high, which suggests they considered the probabilities of the positive outcomes. Additionally, they note that the chance (of winning) is minimally smaller for A but the gain is higher.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the probabilities of winning against the magnitude of the potential gain, noting a trade-off between a slightly lower chance of winning with Lottery A and a higher potential gain compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual does acknowledge the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for both but focuses more on the probabilities of winning and the associated gains rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (80% probability of 0 Euros). However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount to be won, rather than directly applying the rule of preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as their primary criterion. The individual's focus was more on the trade-offs between winning probabilities and amounts rather than on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the sole or primary decision criterion.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 55%, and for Lottery B, it is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery results in a loss, compares the potential gains (noting that Lottery A's gain is twice that of Lottery B but much less probable), and observes that the gain from Lottery B is still very good and very probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the probability and magnitude of the gains, emphasizing the higher probability of a gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is not directly discussed in terms of preference in the verbal report. The individual discusses the probability and magnitude of gains rather than the probability of not gaining (minimum outcome).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (55% chance of 0 Euros). However, the individual's justification emphasizes the desirability of the higher probability of a gain (Lottery B), not the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus is on the probability and magnitude of potential gains, suggesting that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros with a probability of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries. Thus, the relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 99.8% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning in both lotteries is very small and that if one wins, Lottery A offers twice as much as Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual focuses on the low probability of winning in both lotteries and the difference in the winning amounts between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros), which are 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. However, the individual's verbal report does not mention comparing these probabilities; instead, it focuses on the low probability of winning and the difference in winnings.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the comparison of winning amounts and the general low probability of winning, not specifically on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes or a preference based on these probabilities, which are key elements of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with an 80% probability, and there's a 20% chance of 0 Euros, which is also a possible outcome and thus the minimum in terms of loss (no loss). So, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of -3000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of 0 Euros (in terms of no loss) with 20% probability, and -4000 Euros with 80% probability. However, for the decision reason's purpose, we focus on the minimum outcome's probability, which for B, in the context of avoiding loss, would be the 20% chance of not losing anything.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain loss at A as very high and notes that while B's potential loss is higher, there's a small chance of not losing anything at all.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing B over A because, despite the higher potential loss, the difference in loss amounts isn't so great that it outweighs the chance of losing nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considers the potential losses and the chance of not losing anything with B, which aligns with considering the outcomes but focuses more on the aspect of avoiding any loss rather than strictly the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification is based on the balance between the potential losses and the chance of no loss, not strictly on comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the potential outcomes and their probabilities but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The focus is more on the trade-off between the size of potential losses and the chance of avoiding loss altogether, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's some alignment in considering outcomes and their probabilities, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery, preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 20% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 20% chance of -4000 Euros
- Lottery B: 25% chance of -3000 Euros
This information is relevant to the decision reason, as it directly compares the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual notes that neither lottery offers a potential win, acknowledges the loss is higher in Lottery A, and recognizes the probability of loss is higher in Lottery B but does not consider this sufficient to offset the difference in loss magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the balance between the magnitude of potential loss and the probability of that loss, indicating a consideration of both factors in making the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses solely on the probability of the minimum outcome, whereas the individual considers both the probability and the magnitude of the loss. This indicates a partial alignment but also a consideration of additional factors beyond the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification suggests a more nuanced consideration that includes both the probability and the magnitude of loss, not strictly adhering to the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests that while they considered the probability of loss (a component of the decision reason), their decision-making process also heavily weighed the magnitude of the loss, which is not a part of the decision reason. This indicates that the decision reason was likely not the primary or sole basis for the individual's choice, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 90% chance of losing 3000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 45% chance of losing 6000 Euros.
This information is relevant to the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the high loss amount in both lotteries but notes that with Lottery A, there is a high probability of losing a significant amount, whereas with Lottery B, there's a chance to end up with 0 Euros, implying a consideration of the outcomes and their probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the high probability of losing with Lottery A and the potential to lose nothing with Lottery B, indicating a focus on the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considers the probability of losing and the amount, which aligns with focusing on the minimum outcomes but emphasizes the loss amount as well.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual seems to weigh the probabilities and outcomes, particularly focusing on the high probability of a loss in Lottery A and the potential for no loss in Lottery B, which does not directly align with preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome but shows consideration of the probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's consideration of probabilities and outcomes somewhat aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome, but the justification provided does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report indicates consideration of relevant factors (probabilities and outcomes) but does not clearly apply the decision reason's rule in the justification for the choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, but since the reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (which is essentially the probability of not winning), we can derive the relevant information: 
- Lottery A has a 99.9% probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 99.8% probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros).
The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher probability of the minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the probability of losing (which can be interpreted as the probability of getting the minimum outcome) in both lotteries to be approximately equally low. They also consider the amount lost in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification seems to focus on the similarity in the probability of losing and the difference in the amount lost, mentioning that the difference in probability does not make much of a difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason is about the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probability of losing (or getting the minimum outcome). However, the individual also considers the amount lost, which is not part of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems to downplay the difference in probabilities and focuses on the amount lost, suggesting a different basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while there is some alignment in the consideration of probabilities, the individual's justification for their choice does not closely follow the decision reason's rule, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a probability of 100%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, we find that the individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B (""Bei B ist der Gewinn sicher"") and the higher potential gain in Lottery A, but also the risk of receiving nothing (""Bei A ist der Gewinn zwar höher, aber nicht so viel höher und es gibt die Möglichkeit, nichts zu erhalten""). The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the trade-off between the certainty of a gain and the potential for a higher gain versus the risk of no gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual did consider the aspect of certainty (which relates to the probability of the minimum outcome) but did not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. The individual's justification for the choice, however, implies a consideration of the risk (possibility of receiving nothing), which aligns with the concept of the minimum outcome's probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because its minimum outcome (500 Euros) has a 100% probability, compared to Lottery A's minimum outcome (0 Euros) with a 50% probability. The individual's focus on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B suggests an alignment with this rule, although it's not explicitly stated in terms of probabilities of minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with a 50% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% chance of -1000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% chance of -500 Euros
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the loss amount in both lotteries, noting that Lottery A's potential loss is twice as high as Lottery B's, but also mentions the 50/50 chance of losing nothing in Lottery A. The individual also considers the certain loss in Lottery B as relatively high.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to weigh the potential losses against the probabilities of those losses, specifically highlighting the trade-off between the higher potential loss in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual discusses the probability of losing nothing in Lottery A (implying consideration of the minimum outcome's probability) and the certain loss in Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification touches on the trade-off between the potential losses and their probabilities but does not explicitly state a preference based solely on the probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual's consideration of the 50/50 chance of losing nothing in Lottery A and the certain loss in Lottery B suggests an awareness of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which is in line with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's justification does not perfectly align with the decision reason's rule, there is an indication that the probabilities of the outcomes, including the minimum outcomes, were considered. This suggests that the decision reason might have influenced the individual's decision-making process, but it is not a perfect match.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 75%. The information relevant to this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 50% probability.
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 75% probability.
This information is relevant because it directly pertains to the rule of the decision reason, which compares the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the winnings (Gewinnbeträge) are smaller but more probable, indicating consideration of both the amount and probability of winnings. They also compare the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B, suggesting they considered the probability of the minimum (0 Euros) outcome.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating that the amounts in Lottery A are ""hoch und in Ordnung"" (high and okay), implying satisfaction with the potential winnings, and notes that this is better than the high risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B. This indicates the individual considered the trade-off between the potential winnings and the risk of not winning anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the individual discusses the risk of receiving nothing. This suggests alignment between the information considered by the decision reason and the individual.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (since 75% is higher than 50%). However, the individual's justification seems to favor Lottery A because it has more stable or certain outcomes, even though the minimum outcome's probability is lower. This indicates a potential mismatch between the decision reason's rule and the individual's justification, as the individual seems to prioritize the avoidance of the high risk of getting nothing over the sheer probability of the minimum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the assessment of whether the individual used the decision reason is nuanced. The individual does consider the probability of outcomes, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, their justification seems to prioritize stability and the avoidance of high risk over the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus on stability and risk avoidance, rather than strictly following the rule of preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome, suggests that while they considered relevant factors, their decision-making process did not align closely with the given decision reason."
14,"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has the higher probability (25%) of its minimum outcome (-4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B's minimum outcome (-6000 Euros), but since both have the same probability for their respective minimum outcomes, the reason would actually be indifferent or would need further clarification on how to handle ties.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain, that Lottery B has a higher potential loss but it's less probable, and that the amounts in Lottery A are also high but more probable. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the probability and magnitude of losses in both lotteries but does not explicitly state a preference based on the minimum outcome's probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities and magnitudes of losses, which is related but not directly focused on the probability of the minimum outcome as the decision reason dictates.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of its minimum outcome, which is the core of the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process and the decision reason share some similarities in considering probabilities and outcomes, but the individual does not explicitly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 99.9% for Lottery A (for 0 Euros) and 100% for Lottery B (for 5 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the small gain of Lottery B and the small chance of winning something with Lottery A. They also consider not receiving anything (or no loss) as not making a big difference in this case.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the guaranteed small gain of Lottery B against the small chance of a significant gain in Lottery A, noting that not winning (receiving nothing) doesn’t make a significant difference to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is explicitly 99.9% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. The individual discusses the outcomes but does not explicitly mention the probabilities of these outcomes or compare them directly in terms of the decision reason’s criteria.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual’s justification, however, seems to focus more on the existence of a chance to win something versus a guaranteed small win, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems that while the individual considers aspects of the lotteries, they do not explicitly apply the rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of its minimum outcome. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was based on comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability. Since the probabilities and outcomes are provided, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: -5 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that neither lottery offers a gain, but Lottery A has a small loss, while Lottery B has a very low chance of a high loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to accept a small loss (from Lottery A) rather than taking a risk of a very high loss (from Lottery B), even though the chance of the high loss is very low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the nature of the losses and their probabilities, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of minimum outcomes).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification focuses on accepting a smaller loss due to its certainty over a larger loss with a very low probability, which does not directly align with preferring the lottery based solely on the probability of its minimum outcome but does reflect a consideration of the certainty of the loss in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning about preferring a certain small loss over a potential large loss, despite the low probability of the latter, shows an understanding of the risk involved but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of choosing based on the probability of the minimum outcome. The verbal report indicates the individual weighed the certainty of a small loss against the uncertainty of a large loss, which is more aligned with risk aversion than with directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, while there's some alignment in considering the nature of the losses, the decision reason's specific focus on the probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for the choice is not clearly reflected in the individual's justification."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 1500 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of -3000 Euros with 50% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, one wins a significant amount for sure, and with Lottery B, there's a 50% chance to lose a lot. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the guaranteed win in Lottery A and the high risk (50% chance of a significant loss) associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification focuses on the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the high risk of loss in Lottery B, which implies a preference for the lottery with a more favorable minimum outcome probability (100% for a positive outcome in Lottery A vs. 50% for a negative outcome in Lottery B).

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they prioritize the guaranteed positive outcome over the risk of a significant loss, which reflects a consideration of the probability of the minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90 
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the individual's considerations and justification with the decision reason's rule, though it's not a perfect match in terminology or explicit mention of ""probability of the minimum outcome."""

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of at least 2000 Euros (minimum outcome)
- Lottery B: 50% chance of -3000 Euros (minimum outcome)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the certain gain of Lottery A, comparing it to the potential gain of Lottery B, which is higher but only 50% certain. They also consider the risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery B, with the same probability as the potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to weigh the certainty of the gain in Lottery A against the balanced risk and potential of Lottery B, focusing on the certainty and the potential loss associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual considering the certain gain of Lottery A (minimum outcome) and the potential significant loss of Lottery B (also a minimum outcome consideration).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual seems to prioritize the certainty of a positive outcome over a gamble with equal chances of a higher gain or a significant loss, which indirectly reflects a consideration of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment suggests a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report indicates consideration of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities, aligning with the decision reason's rule. However, the individual's justification also includes considerations beyond just the probability of the minimum outcome (such as the balance of risk and potential), which is why the assessment is not a perfect 100."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 50% chance of -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 1000 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B, the smaller but still good amount of money it offers, and the high risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it guarantees a win, even though the amount is smaller, and expressed concern over the high risk of significant loss with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual discussed the guarantee of winning with Lottery B and the risk of losing with Lottery A, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery B because it guarantees a win (100% probability of the minimum outcome), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule, but the verbal report does not explicitly state a comparison of probabilities of minimum outcomes between the two lotteries.

Given the information and comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of its minimum outcome), but the verbal report does not explicitly detail a step-by-step application of the reason as defined. The individual's focus on the guarantee of winning and the risk of loss indirectly supports the use of the reason but lacks explicit mention of comparing probabilities of minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a 50% chance of its minimum outcome (-6000 Euros), and Lottery B has a 100% chance of its minimum outcome (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the fact that with Lottery B, one wins nothing but also loses nothing, implying they recognize the zero-risk nature of Lottery B. They also acknowledge the high potential loss with Lottery A, indicating awareness of the risk associated with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk aversion aspect, highlighting the avoidance of loss as a significant factor. They mention the high potential loss in Lottery A as ""sehr riskant"" (very risky), suggesting that the risk of losing a substantial amount is a critical consideration in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery A and the certainty of no loss with Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes avoiding loss, which indirectly aligns with preferring a lottery where the minimum outcome (0 Euros) has a higher probability (100% in Lottery B), as it ensures no loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding significant losses and their recognition of the certainty of not losing with Lottery B suggests they are considering the aspect of the minimum outcome's probability, albeit not explicitly stating it in terms of probabilities. Their justification aligns with the principle of preferring an option that guarantees no loss (higher probability of the minimum outcome, which is 0 Euros in this case), which is in line with the decision reason's rule.
