assistant
STEPS: 
1. **Assess applicability of the decision reason**: The decision reason focuses on comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, which has a 33% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum (and only) outcome is 2400 Euros, which has a 100% probability.
   
2. **Apply the decision reason**: According to the decision reason, we need to compare the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Lottery A's maximum outcome of 2500 Euros has a 33% probability, while Lottery B's maximum outcome of 2400 Euros has a 100% probability. Since 100% is greater than 33%, Lottery B has a higher probability of achieving its maximum outcome compared to Lottery A.

1,"the maximum outcome of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the maximum outcome.
assistant
STEPS: 
1. **Relevant Information Assessment**: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 34%. This information is directly derivable from the given lotteries.
   
2. **Application of Decision Reason**: According to the decision reason, the preference is determined by comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Lottery A has a 33% chance of yielding its maximum outcome (2500 Euros), while Lottery B has a 34% chance of yielding its maximum outcome (2400 Euros). Since 34% > 33%, Lottery B has a higher probability of achieving its maximum outcome.

assistant
STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:** 
   - The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 80%. For Lottery B, the maximum (and only) outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%.
   - Since we can derive the probabilities of the maximum outcomes from the given lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason's rule:**
