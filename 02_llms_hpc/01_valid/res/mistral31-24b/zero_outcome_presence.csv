0 Euros with 1% probability

Lottery B:
2400 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome.**STEPS:**

**Step 1:**
Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason requires information about the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery.
- Lottery A has a 1% probability of a zero outcome.
- Lottery B has a 0% probability of a zero outcome.
- Since we can derive the relevant information (presence of a zero outcome) from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, we can apply the decision reason.

**Step 2:**
Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome.
- Lottery A has a zero outcome with a 1% probability.
- Lottery B does not have a zero outcome.
- Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

12,"probability
2000 Euros with 25% probability
0 Euros with 50% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome.**STEPS:**

1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:**

The decision reason is concerned with the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery. This information can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

The relevant information about the lotteries is as follows:
- Lottery A has a 75% probability of a 0 Euro outcome.
- Lottery B has a 50% probability of a 0 Euro outcome.

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome.  Both lotteries have a zero outcome. However, Lottery A has a higher probability of a zero outcome (75%) compared to Lottery B (50%). But since the decision reason does not specify how to compare the probabilities of zero outcomes, we consider that the decision reason prefers both lotteries equally.
