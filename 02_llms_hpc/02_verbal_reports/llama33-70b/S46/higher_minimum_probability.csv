STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% (the probability of winning 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 1%.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the guaranteed win in Lottery A and compares the highest possible win in Lottery B, noting it's only 100 Euros more than the guaranteed win in A. They also mention the risk of not making any gain in B, implying they are aware of the probabilities, specifically the risk associated with the 1% chance of winning 0 Euros in B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the potential extra 100 Euros in B are not worth the risk of possibly not gaining anything. They explicitly state that the probabilities in B are not decisive for their decision, focusing instead on the guarantee of a win in A versus the risk in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery. The individual discusses the risk of not gaining anything in B (which relates to the 1% probability of 0 Euros) and the guarantee of a win in A (relating to its 100% probability), showing they considered the aspect of minimum probabilities indirectly.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The individual prefers Lottery A because it guarantees a win, which aligns with preferring the higher minimum probability (100% for A vs. 1% for B). However, the individual's justification focuses more on the risk aversion aspect rather than explicitly stating a preference based on minimum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision process and justification align with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the minimum probabilities as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus is more on the guarantee versus risk, which indirectly relates to the minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the decision reason's outcome, the explicit consideration and application of the minimum probability rule as stated in the decision reason are not clearly articulated in the verbal report. The individual's risk aversion and focus on the guarantee in A versus the risk in B lead to a similar conclusion as the decision reason but through a slightly different emphasis."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 33% (since the other outcome is 67%, and there are only two outcomes), and for Lottery B, it's 34%. The information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain (2500 Euros vs. 2400 Euros) and the difference in probabilities (1% difference) between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers 100 Euros more, and the difference in probabilities (1%) was deemed too small to influence the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability, but the individual's consideration was on the potential gain and the difference in probabilities, not specifically the minimum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (which would be Lottery B with 34% over Lottery A with 33%), but the individual's justification was based on the potential gain, ignoring the difference in probabilities as insignificant.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, as their justification was based on potential gain rather than the minimum probability of winning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (the probability of getting 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (the probability of getting 3000 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 20%.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the aspect of having a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (a safe win) and the risk associated with Lottery A, specifically the 20% chance of ending up with 0 Euros. They also mention that the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries is not too significant for their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by prioritizing a safe win and minimizing risk, indicating that the potential for a higher reward in Lottery A is not enough to outweigh the risk of getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which aligns with the individual's concern about the risk (20% chance of 0 Euros in Lottery A) and their desire for a safe win (100% chance of 3000 Euros in Lottery B). The individual's consideration of risk and safe outcomes indirectly reflects the concept of minimum probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on preferring a safe win and minimizing risk, which effectively leads to the same conclusion as the decision reason—preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability (or, in this context, the certain outcome).

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision process aligns with the logic of the decision reason, prioritizing the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher reward that comes with some risk.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. In this case, both lotteries have a minimum probability associated with the outcome of 0 Euros, which is 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. Since these probabilities can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the lotteries: 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities (20% chance of 4000 Euros vs. a slightly higher chance of 3000 Euros) but believes they are too close to be decisive. The individual focuses on the potential winnings (4000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros) and notes that the second option (0 Euros) is the same for both lotteries and thus not relevant for the decision.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the 20% chance of 4000 Euros over the slightly higher chance of 3000 Euros, primarily focusing on the potential winnings because the probabilities are deemed too similar to influence the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential winnings, with a focus on winnings due to similar probabilities): The individual does mention probabilities but does not specifically compare the minimum probabilities (80% for A and 75% for B) as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the potential winnings due to similar probabilities): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities or using them as the basis for the decision. Instead, the focus is on the potential winnings because the probabilities are seen as too close to matter.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the core of the given decision reason. The focus was on the potential winnings and the similarity of the probabilities, without explicit consideration of the minimum probabilities as the decisive factor. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (the probability of winning 6000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 90% (the probability of winning 3000 Euros). However, the minimum probability in the context of this reason actually refers to the lowest probability of any outcome in each lottery, which would be 55% for Lottery A (the probability of winning 0 Euros) and 10% for Lottery B (the probability of winning 0 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the worst outcome in each lottery: 55% for A and 10% for B. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its minimum probability (of not winning) is higher than that of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery B but noted it's not a certainty. They also considered the nearly 50/50 chance in Lottery A between winning a high sum and winning nothing. The individual seems to focus on the uncertainty of winning in both lotteries and the potential high reward in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B is based on the high potential reward in A and the lack of 100% certainty in winning with B. They seem to prioritize the potential for a higher gain and are deterred by the absence of a guaranteed win in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which translates to the probability of the worst outcome (not winning) being 55% for A and 10% for B. The individual, however, discusses the probabilities of winning and the certainty of the outcomes, not directly addressing the concept of minimum probability as defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of its worst outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery A because 55% (not winning) is greater than 10% (not winning). The individual's justification, however, is based on the potential for a high reward and the lack of certainty in Lottery B, not explicitly on the comparison of the probabilities of the worst outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus was more on the potential gains and the certainty of outcomes rather than the specific rule of comparing the minimum probabilities of the worst outcomes. However, the verbal report does indicate an awareness of probabilities and their impact on the decision, which suggests some similarity in consideration but not a direct application of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects of the lotteries that involve probabilities and outcomes, the specific decision reason provided (focusing on the minimum probability of each lottery's worst outcome) does not directly align with the individual's stated justification for their choice. The individual's decision seems to be influenced more by the potential for high reward and the absence of a guaranteed win in Lottery B rather than the comparison of the minimum probabilities of not winning."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. Given the lotteries:
- Lottery B: 6000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. The minimum probability here is 0.1%.
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 0.2% probability, 0 Euros with 99.8% probability. The minimum probability here is 0.2%.
The information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The minimum probabilities are 0.1% for Lottery B and 0.2% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high reward of each lottery and notes that in both cases, the probability of winning is very low. They also acknowledge that both lotteries have the same alternative outcome (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the higher reward of one lottery (6000 Euros in Lottery B) compared to the other (3000 Euros in Lottery A), stating that the difference in probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) does not matter to them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which is 0.1% for B and 0.2% for A. However, the individual does not explicitly consider the comparison of these minimum probabilities as the basis for their decision; instead, they focus on the reward sizes and the fact that the probabilities are very low.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (which would be Lottery A with 0.2%), but the individual chooses Lottery B based on its higher reward, not the probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the higher minimum probability, but the individual prioritizes the lottery with the higher reward, disregarding the difference in probabilities as insignificant to their decision. This indicates that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% for a loss of -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 80% for a loss of -4000 Euros, but there's also a 20% probability of 0 Euros, which can be considered as the minimum outcome in terms of loss (no loss). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a certain loss, and Lottery B has a chance of no loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual hopes for the 20% chance in Lottery B to end up with 0 Euros, indicating they consider the probability of not losing anything. They also mention not wanting a certain loss in Lottery A when there's an option to avoid any loss in Lottery B, even if the potential loss in B is higher. The individual focuses on the probability of a loss and less on the loss amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the desire to avoid a certain loss and the consideration of the probability of not losing, which aligns with focusing on the possibility of avoiding any loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: Both involve considering the probability of outcomes, especially the aspect of avoiding loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (in this context, the ""minimum"" probability relates to the outcome of no loss or the least undesirable outcome), and the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding a certain loss and hoping for the chance of no loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery that offers a chance of no loss, even if the other outcome is worse.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's focus on avoiding a certain loss and the emphasis on the probability of not losing anything directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the higher value of minimum probability, especially when considering the ""minimum"" in the context of avoiding loss. The verbal report clearly indicates the individual's decision was influenced by the desire to have a chance at no loss, which is the core of the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. In this case, the minimum probability for both lotteries refers to the probability of not winning (or losing), since the other outcome is a loss. For Lottery A, the minimum probability (of losing) is 20%, and for Lottery B, it's 25%. However, the decision reason's application seems to be misunderstood in this context because it actually refers to the probability of the worst outcome (losing), which is what both lotteries' minimum probabilities represent. The relevant information for the decision reason (minimum probabilities of losing) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 80% for Lottery A (not losing, but since there's no gain, we consider the loss probability which is 20%) and 75% for Lottery B (not losing, thus considering the loss probability which is 25%). The correct interpretation for the decision reason should focus on the probability of the worst outcome, which in both cases is losing money. Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower probability of the worst outcome (20% chance of losing -4000 Euros vs. 25% chance of losing -3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual did not focus much on the probabilities since they did not seem significantly different. They looked at where the loss was the least and decided based on that.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing loss, not directly on the probabilities of losing. They mention that the difference in loss probabilities (20% vs. 25%) did not play a role in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the minimum probability of each lottery (in this context, the probability of the worst outcome, which is losing). The individual, however, focused on the amount of loss rather than the probability of the loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (misinterpreted as lower probability of losing in this explanation), but the individual's justification is about minimizing the loss amount, not the probability of the loss. The individual's focus was on where the loss is the least, which aligns more with comparing the loss amounts (-4000 Euros vs. -3000 Euros) rather than their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described, focuses on minimizing the loss amount rather than considering the probabilities of those losses, which is what the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery, which in this context refers to the probability of the worst outcome (loss) for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability (probability of losing) is 55%, and for Lottery B, it's 10% (probability of losing). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability, meaning it prefers the lottery where the probability of the worst outcome is lower. Thus, the relevant information for this reason is the probability of losing in each lottery: 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of loss in both lotteries, mentioning that in Lottery B, there's a 90% chance of losing (which seems to be a misunderstanding since the 90% refers to winning), and in Lottery A, the chances are about 50/50 for losing. The individual seems to focus on the high probability of an outcome in Lottery B and compares it with the more even chances in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery A because the thought of participating in a lottery where they lose 90% of the time (misinterpreted from the actual 90% win rate in Lottery B) is unappealing, despite acknowledging the loss in Lottery A is higher. The justification revolves around the perceived high likelihood of losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the worst outcome (loss), which is 55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B. The individual, however, seems to misinterpret the probabilities, focusing on the high chance of an outcome in Lottery B without correctly identifying it as a win, and perceives Lottery A as having a 50/50 chance of loss.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability (lower probability of the worst outcome), which would be Lottery B (10% chance of losing). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A seems to stem from a misinterpretation of the probabilities rather than a correct application of the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not accurately apply the decision reason as described. The individual's decision seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the probabilities rather than a deliberate choice based on the minimum probability of loss.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.2% (probability of losing 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it is 0.1% (probability of losing 6000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of losing in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of loss in both lotteries and mentioned that the difference of 0.1 (which seems to refer to the difference in probabilities or the specific probabilities themselves) did not play a role in their decision. They focused on where they would lose less.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on minimizing loss, considering the low probabilities of loss in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probabilities of loss) with that considered by the individual (low probabilities of loss and the amount of loss): The individual considered the aspect of loss but seemed to focus more on the magnitude of the loss rather than the probability of the loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which in this context means lower probability of loss since both are losses) to the individual’s justification (minimizing loss based on the amount rather than the probability of loss): The decision reason specifically looks at the probability of the worst outcome, while the individual's justification seems to prioritize the magnitude of the loss over its probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus was on minimizing the amount of loss rather than the probability of loss, which does not align with the decision reason that prioritizes the higher probability (or lower probability of loss in this context) of the minimum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since the other outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Minimum probability = 100%
- Lottery B: Minimum probability = 50%
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) with Lottery A and notes that while Lottery B offers a higher potential win, the chance is ""geringer"" (smaller or less likely).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chooses Lottery A because it offers a secure win, implying that the certainty of the outcome is a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty (100% probability) of winning with Lottery A and the lower probability of the higher win with Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which is Lottery A with 100% probability. The individual chooses Lottery A because it offers a secure win, which is essentially choosing the option with the higher minimum probability (certainty).

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritize the certainty (higher minimum probability) of the outcome in making their choice.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of an outcome is 50% (since both outcomes have 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a minimum probability of 50%, and Lottery B has a minimum probability of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possibility of not losing money (or ""behalt[en]"" which translates to keeping or retaining something, in this context, the money they already have) and the risk of losing 1000 Euros, which ""nicht aus meiner eigenen Tasche kommen"" (do not come from my own pocket). This implies the individual is considering the outcomes and perhaps the perceived risk or source of the potential loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because they do not want to decide on a certain loss (""einen sicheren Verlust""), indicating a preference for avoiding guaranteed negative outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses avoiding a certain loss and the source of potential losses, not directly referencing probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B (100% minimum probability). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding a certain loss, not directly on comparing the minimum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 4000 Euros outcome) and also 25% (for the 2000 Euros outcome), but since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros, the minimum probability of getting any money (which can be considered as the relevant probability for comparison in the context of ""probability of a win"") is actually 50% (25% + 25%). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome), with a 75% chance of 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a win in each lottery and noted that Lottery A has a higher probability of a win compared to Lottery B, despite Lottery B offering a higher potential sum of winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the probability of a win, noting that Lottery A's probability of a win is twice as high as Lottery B's and that the third option (0 Euros) does not pose a loss risk, leading them to choose Lottery A.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of winning, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probability of a win in each lottery. However, the individual seems to interpret ""probability of a win"" as the overall chance of getting any money, which aligns with the calculation of combined probabilities for winning outcomes in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability of winning, and the individual chose Lottery A because it has a higher probability of a win, which suggests alignment with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% for losing -6000 Euros and 75% for gaining 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% for losing -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros, and 50% for gaining 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived as 25% for Lottery A (since the 75% chance of 0 Euros is not a loss, but the focus is on the loss probability) and 25% for the loss in Lottery B (considering the minimum probability of a loss, which applies to both -4000 and -2000 Euros outcomes). However, the decision reason as stated seems to focus on the concept of a ""minimum probability"" without clarifying its application to losses or gains directly. Given the context, it seems the individual's interpretation might align with minimizing loss probability, but the reason as stated is about the ""minimum probability,"" which could be misleading without specifying it's about losses.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probability of a loss in their decision-making process. They noted Lottery A has a 25% chance of losing money, and Lottery B has a combined 50% chance of losing money (-4000 Euros with 25% probability and -2000 Euros with 25% probability). Second, the individual's justification for their choice was to minimize the risk based on the probability of a loss, ignoring the actual sums because they all seemed high, and focusing on the general lower risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probability of loss) with that considered by the individual (probability of a loss), there's a match in the focus on probabilities related to losses. However, the decision reason's phrasing about ""minimum probability"" could be interpreted in various ways, and it's the individual's focus on loss probability that aligns with a practical application of minimizing risk. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the lower probability of loss), there's a conceptual alignment in the sense of minimizing risk, but the decision reason's specific language about ""minimum probability"" might not directly translate to the individual's process without assuming ""minimum probability"" refers to the chance of the worst outcome (loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report indicates a strong focus on minimizing the probability of loss, which aligns with the spirit of the decision reason, even if the reason's wording about ""minimum probability"" is somewhat ambiguous. The individual's process and justification closely match the practical application of the decision reason, especially when considering the context of minimizing loss probabilities. However, the slight ambiguity in the decision reason's wording prevents a perfect match, hence a score of 80, indicating a high likelihood but not absolute certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (or 1) because there is only one outcome with 100% probability.
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) because the lowest probability outcome is 0 Euros with 99.9% probability, but the relevant minimum probability for the decision reason is the probability of the non-zero outcome, which is 0.1%.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (or 1).
- For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the possible gain in Lottery B as decisive for their decision, indicating they focus on the high potential gain and the risk of getting no gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual prefers to take the risk of getting no gain for the chance of a high gain because the certain gain of 5 Euros in Lottery A is considered too low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential high gain and the risk, rather than the probabilities themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery A (100% minimum probability). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the potential high gain and the perceived low value of the certain gain in Lottery A, not on the comparison of minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the higher minimum probability of the outcomes. The individual's focus is on the potential high gain and the risk associated with it, rather than on comparing the minimum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is associated with a loss of -5000 Euros at 0.1% probability, and for the outcome of 0 Euros, the probability is 99.9%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability (which is actually the only probability) is 100% for a loss of -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a minimum probability outcome of 0.1% and Lottery B has a minimum probability outcome of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability of a high loss in Lottery A and the certainty of a small loss in Lottery B. They weigh the risk of a high loss against the certainty of a small loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the certainty of a small loss over the risk, no matter how small, of a high loss, indicating a risk-averse stance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, while the individual focuses on the risk of a high loss versus the certainty of a small loss. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities but is concerned with the potential for a high loss, even at a low probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 100% probability. The individual prefers Lottery B but justifies this choice based on avoiding risk rather than explicitly comparing minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification is based on risk aversion and avoiding the possibility of a high loss, rather than explicitly comparing the minimum probabilities of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. While the outcome of their decision aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (choosing Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on minimum probabilities. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the basis for the individual's decision, but there is a slight possibility due to the alignment in the final choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since both outcomes have a 50% chance), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss in Lottery A, finding the amount too high to risk, and viewed the 50/50 chance between high gain and loss as too risky. They also noted that in Lottery B, there is no risk of loss since a gain is guaranteed.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A is based on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain in Lottery B, indicating a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (minimum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss, certainty of gain). While the individual does consider aspects related to risk and certainty, which could indirectly relate to probabilities, they do not explicitly mention comparing the minimum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher minimum probability) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk and ensuring a gain). The individual's justification aligns with preferring a certain gain (Lottery B) over a risky option (Lottery A), which could be seen as related to the concept of minimum probabilities since Lottery B has a higher minimum probability (100%) than Lottery A (50%). However, the individual's focus is more on the risk aspect and the guarantee of a gain rather than explicitly on the comparison of minimum probabilities.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B due to its higher minimum probability/certainty), but the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made based on comparing minimum probabilities. The individual's reasoning is more directly centered around risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and the decision reason's outcome align (both prefer Lottery B), the explicit reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's criteria (comparing minimum probabilities). The individual's focus on risk and guaranteed gain indirectly relates to the concept of probability but does not clearly indicate the use of the specific decision reason regarding minimum probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has two outcomes with 50% probability each), and for Lottery A, the minimum probability is 100% (since it has one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: Lottery A has a higher minimum probability than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gain in Lottery A versus the risk of loss in Lottery B, weighing the potential loss against the potential gain and prioritizing avoiding loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by preferring a certain gain over a risky option due to the potential for significant loss, indicating a risk-averse approach focused on securing a gain rather than maximizing potential gain at the risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: While the decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, the individual's consideration was more about the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the probabilities but is more focused on the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which aligns with the individual's choice of Lottery A due to its certain outcome. However, the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding loss and securing a certain gain rather than explicitly discussing the comparison of minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), and there is an implicit consideration of the certainty (100% probability) of the outcome in Lottery A. However, the explicit justification provided by the individual focuses more on risk aversion and securing a certain gain rather than directly on the comparison of minimum probabilities between the two lotteries. Therefore, while the decision reason could have influenced the choice, the verbal report does not directly confirm its use, leading to a moderate assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (since it has two outcomes, each with 50% probability), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% (since it has one outcome with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum probabilities of the lotteries, which are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the aspect of risk, specifically mentioning the importance of a low risk in their decision-making process. They weigh the possibility of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A against the guarantee of winning a smaller amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by emphasizing the importance of avoiding risk, specifically the risk of losing a significant amount of money. They prioritize the security offered by Lottery B, even though the potential gain is lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, which directly relates to the concept of risk (higher minimum probability means less risk). The individual's consideration of risk and the desire for a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (secure win) aligns with the concept of preferring higher minimum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which in this case is Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B, based on the desire to avoid risk and secure a win, which is consistent with preferring the higher minimum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's emphasis on avoiding risk and securing a win directly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher minimum probability. The verbal report clearly indicates that the individual's decision process was guided by considerations that are consistent with the decision reason, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the minimum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of minimum probability. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning 0 Euros is 100%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability (considering both outcomes) of winning -6000 Euros is 50%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a minimum probability of 100% for winning 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a minimum probability of 50% for winning -6000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing a significant amount (6000 Euros) in Lottery B and the fact that Lottery A offers no risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers security and no possibility of loss, indicating that the risk of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B was not worth the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the minimum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the risk of loss and the security offered by each lottery. Although the individual's consideration indirectly involves probabilities (by mentioning a ""50 prozentiger Gewinn"" and the risk associated with it), the primary focus is on the outcomes and their implications rather than directly comparing minimum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher minimum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 100% probability of not losing. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery A, but it is based on avoiding risk rather than directly comparing minimum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly indicate that the decision was made based on comparing the minimum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus on risk avoidance and the security of not losing money suggests an alignment with the outcome of the decision reason but not necessarily the application of the reason itself as defined. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but without complete certainty."
