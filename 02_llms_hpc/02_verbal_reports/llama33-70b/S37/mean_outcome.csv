STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (2400) / 1 = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the monetary values of the outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in both lotteries, specifically mentioning a ""100 prozentige Chance"" (100% chance) for Lottery B and implying a comparison with the overall chance of winning in Lottery A, which they perceived as a ""99 prozentige Chance"" (99% chance).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its 100% chance of winning, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning): The individual focused on the probabilities, not the mean outcomes of the lotteries as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with a 100% chance of winning): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would have preferred Lottery A based on its calculated mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of winning and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, rather than the mean outcomes of the lotteries, indicates that the decision reason provided was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, while the individual considered the probability of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual preferred the lottery with the higher probability of winning.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus was on probability rather than mean outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome would be (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome would be (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and the probability of winning for Lottery B, specifically mentioning the ""100 prozentige Chance zu gewinnen"" (100% chance of winning).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its 100% chance of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of both lotteries, which involves calculating or comparing the average values of the outcomes. However, the individual's verbal report focuses on the certainty of winning with Lottery B, not on calculating or comparing mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on the certainty of winning, not on the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery B was based on the certainty of winning (100% chance), not on comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered ""verschiedene Ergebnisse"" (various outcomes), which implies they looked at the different possible outcomes of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is ""mehr gewinn, minimaler prozentualer Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied"" (more winnings, minimal percentage probability difference). This suggests the individual considered both the potential winnings and the probability differences between the two lotteries but emphasizes the aspect of ""more winnings.""

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (various outcomes and their associated probabilities), it appears the individual did consider the outcomes but not necessarily in the manner specified by the decision reason (calculating mean outcomes independent of probabilities).
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (more winnings, minimal percentage probability difference), the individual's reasoning seems to align partially with the decision reason in that they mention ""more winnings,"" which could imply a consideration of the higher outcome in Lottery A. However, the individual also mentions ""minimaler prozentualer Wahrscheinlichkeitsunterschied,"" which introduces a consideration of probability not present in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment indicates that while there are elements in the individual's reasoning that align with the decision reason (consideration of higher winnings), the individual's justification also includes factors not considered by the decision reason (probability differences), making it unlikely that the decision reason was used in its pure form. The assessment is closer to 0 (certain that the decision reason was not used) than to 100 (certain that the decision reason was used) but does acknowledge some overlap in the considerations."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered ""verschiedene Ergebnisse"" (various outcomes), which implies they looked at the different possible outcomes of the lotteries. However, the specific calculation or consideration of the mean outcome as per the decision reason is not mentioned.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because the ""Chance für Gewinn höher"" (chance of winning is higher), which refers to the probability of winning in Lottery B being higher than in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which does not directly relate to the probability of winning as mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered various outcomes but the report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B because of its higher probability of winning, not because of the mean outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision. Instead, the decision was based on the perceived higher chance of winning with Lottery B.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and noted a small percentage difference in terms of probability between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B but did not explicitly state the reasoning behind this choice in terms of outcomes or probabilities beyond noting the small percentage difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probability differences): The individual considered the outcomes and probability differences but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification does not clearly align with the decision reason's rule, as they focused on the probability difference rather than the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision to choose Lottery B could align with the decision reason (since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome according to the decision reason's calculation), but the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was used. The individual's focus on probability differences rather than mean outcomes suggests uncertainty about whether the decision reason was applied.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -3000 is greater than -2000 (less negative). The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the different winning chances (Gewinnchancen) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the loss is less probable (Verlust geringer wahrscheinlich). This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing and the magnitude of the loss in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which does not directly involve considering probabilities. In contrast, the individual considered the probabilities of winning or losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (less negative in this case), which would lead to choosing Lottery A. The individual also chose Lottery A but based on the probability of loss being lower, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the individual considered probabilities and the decision reason does not. However, both lead to the selection of Lottery A, but for different reasons.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to this decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of loss (referred to as ""Verlustchance"") and the amount of loss (""Verlust"") for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, although the chance of loss is higher, the amount of loss is smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, considered the probability and amount of loss, which indirectly relates to the outcomes but does not directly align with calculating a mean outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on a different rationale (lower loss amount despite a higher chance of loss), not explicitly on the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B, but the justification provided in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome. The focus on loss amount and probability of loss in the verbal report does not directly reflect the calculation of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason. Therefore, while the choice is the same, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason."

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -1500 Euros is greater than -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of losing money in each lottery and compared these chances. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they perceived the chance of losing money to be lower in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning and the amount of loss in case of winning (though it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the term ""Verlust"" which typically means loss, but in the context of winning, it likely refers to the amount won). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because, although the probability of winning is higher, the ""loss"" (likely referring to the amount won) is ""deutlich geringer"" (significantly smaller) in the case that it happens. This suggests the individual considered the impact of the outcome sizes in relation to their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing means.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros, so the mean is (4000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with a mean of 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""höhere Summe zu 25% chance"" which translates to ""higher sum at 25% chance"" for Lottery B, indicating they considered the outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the ""höhere Summe"" (higher sum) at a specific probability, which suggests they might be comparing outcomes but does not directly state they calculated means or compared them as the decision reason suggests.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean of all outcomes for each lottery, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating means or considering all outcomes equally regardless of probability. Instead, it focuses on a ""higher sum"" at a specific probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification seems to be based on a different or incomplete analysis, focusing on a specific probability and outcome sum rather than the overall mean of all outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's requirement to calculate and compare the mean outcomes of the lotteries.

The mean is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since Lottery A has a mean of -3000 Euros and Lottery B has a mean of -2000 Euros, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of loss in both lotteries and the magnitude of potential losses. Specifically, they noted that Lottery B has a 50% chance of losing (implying they considered the 50% chance of getting 0 Euros as not losing in this context), and they recognized that while the loss in Lottery A is higher if it occurs, the chance of it happening is lower.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the likelihood and impact of losses, noting that a loss is more likely in Lottery B due to its 50% chance of not losing (which might be a misunderstanding since the 50% refers to getting 0 Euros, and there are losses associated with the other 50%), but also acknowledging the higher potential loss in Lottery A if it happens, which has a lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating the mean outcome of each lottery by summing all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes. The individual, however, discusses probabilities and the magnitude of losses without mentioning calculating means or summing outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual's justification, however, seems to be based on the perceived likelihood and magnitude of losses rather than a direct comparison of mean outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not seem to have explicitly used the decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes to make their decision. Their focus was more on the probabilities and magnitudes of potential losses rather than on calculating and comparing mean outcomes.

For Lottery A, there is one outcome: -5 Euros. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes: -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the mean for Lottery A is (-5 Euros) / 1 = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (-5000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = -2500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because -5 Euros is greater than -2500 Euros. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering various options and deciding on Lottery B because the chance to lose is minimal. This implies the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of losing in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is that the chance to lose (in a significant amount) is minimal, which aligns with considering the probability of the significant loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, disregarding probabilities. However, the individual's consideration, as expressed, focuses on the probability of losing, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery A. In contrast, the individual chose Lottery B based on the minimal chance of losing a significant amount, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason calculates mean outcomes without considering probabilities, leading to a preference for Lottery A, whereas the individual chose Lottery B based on the minimal chance of a significant loss, indicating a focus on probability rather than mean outcome. This discrepancy suggests the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of its 100% win chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which involves calculations of the outcomes of both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the 100% win chance of Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning calculations of mean outcomes or comparing the outcomes of both lotteries in the manner described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the win, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the 100% win chance of Lottery A and lack of mention of comparing mean outcomes or considering both lotteries' outcomes in the decision-making process suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher mean outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the outcomes (""ergebnisse"") but focuses on the 100% win chance of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of its 100% win chance (""100 prozentige gewinnchance"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean of all outcomes, but the individual focuses on the certainty of winning with Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the win, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the certainty of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not explicitly used. However, the choice of Lottery A aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome, but this seems to be coincidental based on the provided justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's criteria, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used in the decision-making process."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes for each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries and decided on Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of winning. The justification for the choice focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning in Lottery B), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the probability of winning, not the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason. Therefore, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a 100% chance of winning).

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 Euros. Since the decision reason can be applied by calculating these means, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual chose Lottery B because it involves no risk of losing money. This indicates that the individual considered the aspect of risk (or the absence of potential loss) in making their decision. The justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the absence of risk, not on calculating and comparing mean outcomes as per the decision reason.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing money), it's clear that the individual did not focus on the mean outcomes as the decision reason prescribes. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding risk) does not align with the rule of the decision reason (comparing mean outcomes). Therefore, based on both comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision.
