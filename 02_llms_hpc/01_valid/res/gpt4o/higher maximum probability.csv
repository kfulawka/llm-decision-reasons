higher maximum probability
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess the maximum probabilities of each lottery.
- Lottery A offers:
  - 2500 Euros with 33% probability
  - 2400 Euros with 66% probability
  - 0 Euros with 1% probability
  The maximum probability is 66%.

- Lottery B offers:
  - 2400 Euros with 100% probability
  The maximum probability is 100%.

Since we have derived the maximum probabilities for both lotteries, the relevant information can be summarized:
- Maximum probability for Lottery A: 66%
- Maximum probability for Lottery B: 100%

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability.
- Comparing the maximum probabilities, 66% (Lottery A) vs. 100% (Lottery B):
  - 100% (Lottery B) is higher than 66% (Lottery A).

Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred.
