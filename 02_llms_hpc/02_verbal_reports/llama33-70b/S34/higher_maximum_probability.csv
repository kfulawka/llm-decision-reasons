STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for the 2400 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2400 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 66% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certainty of gaining 2400 Euros with Lottery A (""sicher ist sicher""), implying they considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A. They also acknowledge the small chance of losing with Lottery B (""nur zu 1 Prozent verlieren kann"") but seem to prioritize the certainty of gain over the potential for a slightly higher gain with a lower probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the outcome with Lottery A, stating that the additional potential gain of 100 Euros with Lottery B did not entice them (""die zusätzlichen 100 punkte haben mich nicht gelockt""). This suggests the individual valued the guaranteed outcome over the potential for a higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason hinges on the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which are 66% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A. The individual considered the certainty (100% probability) of Lottery A, aligning with the decision reason's focus on maximum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with 100%. The individual chose Lottery A, citing the value of certainty, which aligns with preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and their choice of Lottery A because of its guaranteed payout aligns perfectly with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. This suggests that the individual indeed used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 66% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Here, both lotteries have their maximum probabilities associated with the 0 Euro outcome, which are 67% for Lottery A and 66% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report is ""gab da für mich keine wesentlichen Unterschiede,"" which translates to ""there were no significant differences for me."" This suggests the individual considered the overall impression or comparison between the two lotteries but does not specify what aspects were compared.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice, merely stating a lack of significant differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention probabilities or the specific outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification (or lack thereof) does not indicate consideration of this rule. The individual's statement about no significant differences does not align with the specific comparison of maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not provide evidence that the individual considered the maximum probabilities of the lotteries or used the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for winning 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report is brief and mentions ""3000 reicht mir um happy zu sein,"" which translates to ""3000 is enough to make me happy."" This suggests the individual considered the amount of 3000 Euros as sufficient for their happiness but does not explicitly mention probabilities or a comparison of the maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is based on the sufficiency of the amount of 3000 Euros for happiness, not on the probabilities associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual's consideration, as stated, focuses on the sufficiency of the amount of 3000 Euros for happiness, without mentioning probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual's justification, however, is about the sufficiency of the amount, not directly about comparing probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, there's no direct indication that the individual used the decision reason that considers the maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision. The verbal report does not mention probabilities or comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are crucial for the decision reason in question.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 80% chance of 0 Euros, 20% chance of 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 75% chance of 0 Euros, 25% chance of 3000 Euros.
The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher maximum probability (80% vs 75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""keine großen Abweichungen zw A und B, mit höheren Gewinn bei A,"" which translates to ""no major differences between A and B, with higher winnings at A."" This indicates the individual considered the potential winnings (outcomes) of both lotteries and noted the higher reward associated with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the similarity between the two lotteries but highlights the higher potential gain in Lottery A. There is no explicit mention of considering the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's consideration, as described, focuses on the potential winnings and does not explicitly mention probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 80% probability of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the higher potential winnings of Lottery A, not the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the maximum probabilities of the lotteries when making their decision, which is the core aspect of the decision reason provided. Instead, the focus was on the potential winnings, suggesting a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities. Since Lottery B has a higher maximum probability, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential winnings of both lotteries (6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B) and mentions the probability of winning, noting that 3000 Euros ""ist eben wahrscheinlicher"" (is simply more likely), indicating an awareness of the different probabilities associated with each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the potential choice of Lottery B by mentioning that while 6000 Euros would be nice, 3000 Euros is sufficient and more likely to be won, implying that the higher probability of winning influences their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considers the probability of winning a positive amount, not explicitly the maximum probability across all outcomes. However, the individual does consider the higher likelihood of winning with Lottery B, which aligns with the aspect of comparing probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, and the individual seems to prefer Lottery B because it offers a sufficient win with a higher probability, which aligns with the decision reason’s rule in the context of preferring a more probable win, even though the individual does not explicitly compare the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the probabilities and a preference for the lottery with the higher probability of a positive outcome, which aligns with the spirit of the decision reason. However, the report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, while there is a strong indication that the individual's decision process was influenced by considerations similar to the decision reason, it is not a perfect match. Thus, the assessment is higher than 50 (uncertain) but not at 100 (certain), reflecting the alignment of the individual's justification with the decision reason's preference for higher probability, albeit with some nuances in how probabilities are considered."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros) and for Lottery B, it is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (0 Euros in both cases).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that both lotteries have a low chance of winning (""kaum Gewinnchance bei beiden""), which indicates they considered the probabilities of winning but does not specify which probabilities they compared.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not provide a clear justification for choosing one lottery over the other, simply stating that both options are unattractive (""beide doof"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of getting 0 Euros in both cases. The individual mentions the low chance of winning but does not specify comparing the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual does not provide a justification that aligns with this rule. The individual's comment does not indicate a comparison of the maximum probabilities or a preference based on this comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the maximum probabilities of the lotteries or made a decision based on comparing these probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which specifically considers the maximum probability of each lottery, was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros).
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for -3000 Euros).
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual.
The individual mentions the potential loss in both lotteries but highlights the attempt to avoid loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice.
The individual justifies the choice based on the attempt to avoid loss, implying a consideration of the potential outcomes rather than explicitly discussing probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual.
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities or the comparison of maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with 100% probability. However, the individual's justification seems to focus on the attempt to avoid loss rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the outcomes.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 75% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of not losing (0 Euros) in each lottery. This information is: Lottery A has an 80% chance of not losing, and Lottery B has a 75% chance of not losing.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""unwesentliche unterschiede in der wahrscheinlichkeit zu verlieren"" which translates to ""insignificant differences in the probability of losing,"" and ""höherer Verlust bei A"" which means ""higher loss at A."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of losing and the magnitude of potential losses in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the comparison of the probabilities of losing and the magnitude of losses between the two lotteries, noting the higher potential loss in Lottery A but also mentioning insignificant differences in the probability of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability (which, in this context, relates to the probability of not losing), whereas the individual discusses the probability of losing and the magnitude of losses, not directly addressing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (in this case, Lottery A because 80% > 75%), but the individual's justification doesn't explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of not losing or the maximum probability. Instead, the individual seems to weigh the potential losses and the probabilities of losing, without directly applying the rule of choosing based on the higher probability of not losing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The focus in the report is on the comparison of potential losses and the probabilities of losing, rather than the maximum probabilities of the lotteries or the probability of not losing. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for the outcome -3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for the outcome 0 Euros). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss (i.e., the probability of the 0 Euros outcome) for both lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on the comparison of these probabilities, mentioning that the probability of not making a loss was higher for Lottery B, despite the loss being higher if it occurred.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of not incurring a loss), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of any outcome, whereas the individual focused on the probability of a specific outcome (0 Euros). However, the individual's justification does involve comparing probabilities, which is a key aspect of the decision reason. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 90% probability. The individual's statement, however, suggests a preference for Lottery B based on the probability of not incurring a loss, which indicates a different focus. Given this, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the high probability of losing in both options and compares the potential loss values (Wert ist allerdings bei B höher, falls ich doch verliere), indicating they focus on the potential losses and their magnitudes when losses occur. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of potential losses when they occur, not directly mentioning the probabilities of these losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is derivable from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report is very brief, stating ""sicher ist sicher :)"" which translates to ""safe is safe"" or implies a preference for certainty. This suggests the individual considered the certainty or reliability of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The phrase implies that the individual values the guaranteed outcome, suggesting a preference for the certain option over the risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, while the individual seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome, which aligns with considering the maximum probability (100% for Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery B with 100% probability. The individual's justification, valuing certainty (""sicher ist sicher""), also points towards preferring Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on certainty and the decision reason's preference for the higher maximum probability both lead to the same conclusion: preferring Lottery B. This suggests that the decision reason might have been used, as the individual's deliberation process (as described) aligns with the rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification (preferring certainty) and the decision reason's rule (preferring the higher maximum probability), but it's not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome of -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both outcomes of -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the potential loss associated with Lottery A and the possibility of ""not losing without a fight"" with Lottery B, implying a consideration of the outcomes and perhaps the concept of risk or loss aversion rather than explicitly discussing probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to focus on the psychological aspect of loss and the concept of ""fighting"" or not giving up, which doesn't directly relate to the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason is based on the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's consideration seems to be more about the nature of the losses and the psychological aspect of the choice rather than the probabilities themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of losing 500 Euros. However, the individual's justification does not mention probabilities or the concept of preferring a lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because its maximum probability (50%) is lower than that of Lottery B (75%), but since the reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, it is actually indifferent in this case as neither lottery has a higher maximum probability for a positive outcome, but it would technically prefer Lottery B if we consider only the maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning nothing in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning nothing in both lotteries, indicating a concern for the risk of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing, which aligns with the aspect of maximum probability, but the focus is more on the risk aversion towards the higher probability of winning nothing rather than directly comparing maximum probabilities for any outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, but the individual's justification seems to be based on avoiding the higher risk of winning nothing, which indirectly relates to the probabilities but does not directly apply the rule of preferring the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's focus on avoiding the high probability of winning nothing aligns somewhat with considering probabilities, but the decision reason specifically looks for the higher maximum probability, which does not directly align with the individual's justification. The individual's reasoning seems more risk-averse concerning the specific outcome of winning nothing rather than applying the decision reason's rule about maximum probabilities across all outcomes. Therefore, while there is some relation to probabilities, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly present."

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros). 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for losing 5 Euros). 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
The individual mentions ""wahrscheinlichkeit zu verlieren ist sehr sehr gering,"" which translates to ""the probability of losing is very, very low."" 
This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing in their deliberation. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual's statement implies they were focusing on the low probability of a negative outcome, but the exact justification for choosing one lottery over the other is not explicitly stated in terms of comparing the two lotteries directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is related to but not exactly the same as the individual's focus on the low probability of losing. 
The individual seems to be considering the probability of a negative outcome rather than the maximum probability of any outcome. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of losing 5 Euros. 
However, the individual's statement about the low probability of losing suggests they might be leaning towards Lottery B, which has a very low probability of losing a significant amount (-5000 Euros) but is actually about the high probability of not losing (99.9% chance of 0 Euros), aligning more closely with the concept of maximizing the probability of a specific outcome (in this case, not losing).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual. The individual's focus on the probability of losing and its being ""very, very low"" indicates they were considering probabilities, but the specific reason given (maximizing the probability of any outcome) does not directly align with the verbal report's emphasis on avoiding loss. The individual's thought process seems to touch upon aspects of probability but does not clearly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability as the primary justification for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 1500 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning 3000 Euros and losing 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery: 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a preference for winning 1500 Euros and states that 3000 Euros (with its associated risk) is ""nicht sehr attraktiv"" (not very attractive), indicating they considered the outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be based on the attractiveness of the guaranteed win of 1500 Euros over the risky option of potentially winning 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities, which are 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual's consideration, as described, does not explicitly mention probabilities but focuses on the attractiveness of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, while not explicitly mentioning probabilities, prefers Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome, which aligns with preferring the higher maximum probability (certainty of winning) but does not directly reference the concept of probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. However, the preference for the guaranteed win (Lottery A) over the risky option (Lottery B) could indirectly align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability (100% for Lottery A). The justification provided does not clearly articulate a focus on probabilities, making it uncertain whether the decision reason was used. Thus, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a slight inclination towards the decision reason being used but without clear evidence."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome of 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 100% chance of 2000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 50% chance of 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of -3000 Euros.
This information can be used to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions ""2000+ ist schon sehr attraktiv"" which translates to ""2000+ is very attractive,"" indicating they find the guaranteed amount of 2000 Euros appealing. They also mention ""3000- zu 50 Prozent ist mir viel zu hoch im Gegensatz"" which translates to ""3000- at 50 percent is much too high in contrast,"" suggesting they are deterred by the 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to justify their choice based on the attractiveness of the guaranteed amount in Lottery A and the unappealing risk associated with the potential loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual, while considering the outcomes and their probabilities, does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with 100% probability. The individual's justification, however, is based more on the attractiveness of the guaranteed win and the risk of loss rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the decision reason based on the maximum probability of each lottery. While they do choose Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's preference, their justification focuses on the attractiveness of the guaranteed outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than the comparison of maximum probabilities. This suggests that the decision reason might not have been the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the potential gain of 3000 Euros in Lottery B and seems to weigh it against the guaranteed 1000 Euros in Lottery A. They also mention the risk associated with the -3000 Euros outcome in Lottery B but express a willingness to take this risk for the potential higher gain.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies taking the risk of Lottery B by the potential high reward, indicating a willingness to overlook the risk of losing 3000 Euros for the chance to win 3000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key factor. The individual seems more focused on the potential outcomes and the risk involved rather than the probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 100% probability of winning 1000 Euros. However, the individual’s justification does not mention the probability of winning but rather the potential outcomes and the willingness to take a risk for a higher reward.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the maximum probability of outcomes. The report focuses on the potential gains and the willingness to take risks rather than the probabilities of those outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both outcomes 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential gain of 6000 Euros in Lottery B but noted it comes with a 50% probability, which seems too risky given the potential loss of the same amount. The individual also considered the certainty of no loss (0 Euros) in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential gain of 6000 Euros in Lottery B was too much to risk at a 50% probability, preferring to avoid loss by choosing Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considered the probabilities but focused more on the risk associated with the 50% probability of a significant loss or gain in Lottery B rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with 100%. The individual's justification implies a preference for avoiding risk, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly mention comparing maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher maximum probability (Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing maximum probabilities as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus on risk avoidance due to the high stakes and 50% probability in Lottery B suggests an influence of probability considerations but not necessarily the specific rule of choosing based on the maximum probability. Therefore, it's somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used."
