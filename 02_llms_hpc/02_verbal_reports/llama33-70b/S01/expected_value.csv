STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01). For Lottery B, the EV = (2400 * 1). Calculating these: 
- For Lottery A: EV = 825 + 1584 + 0 = 2409 Euros.
- For Lottery B: EV = 2400 Euros.
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a 100% chance of winning, which implies they prioritized certainty of gain over potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (amounts and probabilities): The individual considered the basic elements needed to calculate expected value but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose the lottery with 100% chance of winning): The individual's justification does not explicitly align with the decision reason's rule since they prioritized certainty over expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty of gain (100% chance of winning) rather than the expected monetary value of the lotteries suggests they did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The verbal report does not indicate a consideration of the expected values of the lotteries as the basis for the decision, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 825 Euros for Lottery A and 816 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes (Gewinne) of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to achieve a gain (Gewinn), implying they focused on the probability of winning rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected value, but the individual considered probabilities and outcomes without explicitly mentioning calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning, not the expected value. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of Lottery A and Lottery B. The expected value (EV) is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain, which implies they prioritized certainty over potential higher gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, which are the components needed to calculate expected values. However, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the win, not the comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the certainty of the win, not on the comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value of each lottery and the individual does not mention this in their justification, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (the expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts that could be won in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the potential to win the higher amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, but the individual's report mentions looking at the amounts that could be won, not explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, while the individual chose based on the potential to win the higher amount, which aligns with comparing outcomes but not directly with comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process focused on the potential winnings rather than the expected values of the lotteries. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating or comparing expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as defined, which involves considering the expected values of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on the potential winnings, not explicitly on the expected values or their comparison."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 0.2%) + (0 Euros * 99.8%) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 6 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that promises the higher gain because the probability of winning is similarly low in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which depend on both outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification is based on the promise of a higher gain given similarly low winning probabilities, not explicitly on expected values.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus was on the size of the potential gain rather than the calculated expected value of each lottery. The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual calculated or compared the expected values of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-3000 * 1) = -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are -3200 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities, but then chose the lottery that has the possibility of not incurring a loss. The individual also mentions that the difference between 3000 and 4000 Euros in loss was not significant to them. The information considered by the individual includes the outcomes and probabilities, but the focus is on the possibility of avoiding a loss. The justification for the choice is based on the possibility of no loss and the perceived insignificant difference between the two potential losses.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and the possibility of no loss), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the expected values as the decision reason would require. Instead, the individual focused on the potential for avoiding a loss. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not align with the individual's justification (focusing on avoiding a loss and the difference between potential losses). Based on these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason based on expected values to make the decision.

The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more probable to achieve no loss (i.e., 0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of expected values, which are derived from outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but focused on the probability of achieving no loss rather than calculating or directly considering expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification is based on the probability of not incurring a loss, not directly on the expected value.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly use the expected value to make the decision but rather focused on the probability of avoiding a loss. This approach does not align with the decision reason provided, which explicitly considers the expected value of each lottery.

The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and in this case, both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more probable to not incur a loss. This implies the individual focused on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but focused on the probability of not incurring a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on avoiding a loss, not directly on expected value.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. Instead, the individual's focus was on minimizing the risk of loss, which aligns with a different decision-making criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries. Both lotteries have the same expected value, indicating the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and gains (outcomes) of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on selecting the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss. This implies the individual focused on the probability of avoiding a negative outcome rather than calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected value calculation based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains but with a focus on avoiding loss), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual did consider probabilities and outcomes but not in the context of calculating expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (prefer the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss), the two rules do not align. The individual's rule does not directly relate to expected value calculations.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on minimizing loss rather than maximizing expected value.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value of Lottery B is (1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros. The expected value of Lottery A is (500 Euros * 1) = 500 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered all probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice is that they selected the lottery where a win occurs definitively, implying a preference for certainty.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts, focusing on the certainty of a win), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values in their justification. Instead, they emphasized the certainty of winning. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification does not align with comparing expected values but rather with avoiding uncertainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities and amounts, which aligns with the information needed to calculate expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification mentions making a risk decision, focusing on the possibility of not incurring a loss, which does not directly align with choosing based on expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on risk and the possibility of no loss, rather than explicitly comparing expected values or stating a preference based on expected value, suggests that the decision reason considering expected values was likely not the primary basis for the decision. However, the consideration of probabilities and amounts leaves a small possibility that expected values played some role, albeit not explicitly stated as the justification for the choice."

For Lottery B, the calculation is: EV_B = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it indicates that the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities and focused on the number of events that promise a win despite equal probabilities of winning compared to the other lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with more events promising a win, given equal probabilities of winning compared to the other lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected value, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are equal.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. This indicates they looked at the essential components needed to calculate expected value or make a decision based on the certainty of a gain. Second, the individual's justification for their choice was that they selected the lottery where a win is definitely expected. This implies they prioritized the certainty of receiving a prize over the potential for a higher reward with a lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts), it appears the individual had access to and considered the necessary information to calculate expected values, even if they didn't explicitly mention doing so. However, their focus was on the certainty of a win rather than the expected value calculation itself. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) with the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with a definite win), it seems the individual's decision-making process was more aligned with ensuring a guaranteed outcome rather than strictly following the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's justification indicates a preference for certainty over potential.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the necessary information for the decision reason, their justification for the choice (focusing on the certainty of a win) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the higher expected value), especially since the expected values are equal and the decision reason would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on expected value alone. The low assessment score indicates it is unlikely the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

This implies the individual focused on the probability of avoiding a loss rather than directly comparing the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves outcomes and probabilities. The individual did consider outcomes and probabilities but focused on the aspect of avoiding loss, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing the probability of loss, not directly on expected values. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent, but the individual's justification does not align with calculating and comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and not explicitly considering the expected values as the basis for their decision, as described in the verbal report, indicates that the decision reason based on expected values was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1500 * 1) = 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 0 Euros for Lottery B and 1500 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and amounts): The individual considered the components needed to calculate expected value but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose the lottery where a win is certain): The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of a win rather than the comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty of a win and lack of explicit mention of comparing expected values suggests that the decision reason based on expected value was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The expected values are 0 Euros for Lottery B and 2000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is expected with certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the expected values of the lotteries, which depend on the outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, aligning with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on choosing a lottery with a certain win, which indirectly relates to the concept of expected value since a certain win implies a non-zero positive expected value, but the individual does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or maximizing them.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on certainty of a win does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of maximizing expected value, although the chosen lottery (A) happens to have the higher expected value. The verbal report suggests the individual's decision was based more on the certainty of the outcome rather than a direct comparison of expected values. Thus, while the chosen lottery aligns with the decision reason's preference, the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason regarding expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 * 1) = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would achieve a certain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities): The individual considered the necessary information to calculate expected values, but the report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the lottery with a certain gain): The individual's justification focuses on achieving a certain gain, which aligns with preferring Lottery B due to its guaranteed positive outcome but does not explicitly mention comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason of comparing expected values to make their choice. Instead, their focus was on achieving a certain gain, which led them to choose Lottery B. This rationale does not align with the decision reason provided, which is based on expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason to the given decision problem, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 Euros * 0.5) + (-6000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (0 Euros * 1) = 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is that both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities, suggesting they looked at the full picture of both lotteries. The individual's justification for their choice is based on selecting the lottery that seems safest in terms of not incurring a loss. This implies they prioritized avoiding a negative outcome over potentially gaining.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries being equal) with what the individual considered (all outcomes and probabilities), it's clear the individual had access to the necessary information to apply the decision reason. However, the individual's justification focuses on avoiding loss rather than directly comparing expected values. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not directly align with the individual's justification (avoiding loss), especially since both lotteries have the same expected value. Given that the individual's reasoning is centered around avoiding a loss, which is not directly related to comparing expected values, it suggests the decision reason based on expected value may not have been the primary driver of their choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual had the information necessary to consider expected values, their justification for the choice was based on a different criterion (avoiding loss), suggesting the decision reason regarding expected value was likely not the main factor in their decision-making process."
