STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A: EV_A = (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01). For Lottery B: EV_B = (2400 * 1). Calculating these: EV_A = 825 + 1584 + 0 = 2409 Euros, EV_B = 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen,"" which translates to ""very low probability of winning nothing."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of not winning (or winning 0 Euros) in their deliberation. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but implies a concern for the risk of not winning anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the expected value of each lottery, which involves considering all outcomes and their probabilities. The individual, however, seems to focus on the probability of winning nothing, which is part of the information but not the entirety of what the decision reason requires.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual’s justification, as inferred, seems to be about avoiding a very low probability of winning nothing, which does not directly align with comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the ""very low probability of winning nothing"" does not align with calculating and comparing the expected values of the two lotteries, which is what the decision reason entails. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Verbal report:
Sind sich zu identisch, daher nach Gefühl gewählt

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by calculating the expected value of each lottery. The expected value of Lottery A is 0.34 * 2400 = 816 Euros, and the expected value of Lottery B is 0.33 * 2500 = 825 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 816 Euros for Lottery A and 825 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the lotteries seem too similar, and the choice was made based on intuition (""nach Gefühl gewählt""). The individual considered the similarity between the two lotteries but does not provide a detailed justification for the choice beyond relying on intuition. There is no explicit mention of calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (similarity and intuition), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not match the individual's justification for the choice (making a decision based on intuition due to the perceived similarity of the lotteries). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason based on expected values to make the decision.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 1) = 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 3200 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probability of winning in Lottery A (""eine sehr gute Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"") and the certain high amount of 3000 Euros in Lottery B. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is that despite Lottery A having a good winning probability, the certain high amount of 3000 Euros in Lottery B led to the decision in favor of B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of 3200 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning in A and the certain amount in B), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A) with the individual's justification (preferring the certain high amount of Lottery B over the probability of a higher amount in A), it seems the individual's decision was based on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected value. The individual chose Lottery B despite it having a lower expected value, indicating the decision reason was not followed.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (3000 Euros * 25%) + (0 Euros * 75%) = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (4000 Euros * 20%) + (0 Euros * 80%) = 800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a potential gain that is ""nur 5% weniger"" (only 5% less) but with a ""höheren Gewinn"" (higher gain), implying they considered the difference in potential winnings and possibly the probabilities or the overall value of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual believes ""Das Risiko ist es wert"" (the risk is worth it), indicating they weighed the risk against the potential reward and found it acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires calculating or comparing expected values. While the individual discusses the difference in potential gains and finds the risk worth it, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. However, their consideration of the ""5% weniger"" gain and the higher potential win suggests an implicit comparison of the lotteries' values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the risk being worth it for the higher potential gain, which aligns with preferring a higher expected value if we interpret their comments as valuing the potential higher reward despite the risk.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not directly state that they calculated expected values or explicitly chose based on the higher expected value. However, their discussion about the risk being worth it for a higher potential gain indirectly suggests they might have considered the concept of expected value or at least the trade-off between risk and reward, which is closely related.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects a leaning towards the individual possibly using a reasoning process related to the decision reason (comparing values and considering risk) but without explicit confirmation that they directly applied the decision reason of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the outcomes and probabilities provided. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 0.90) + (0 Euros * 0.10) = 2700 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""high probability of winning."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of winning associated with each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for choosing one lottery over the other but implies a focus on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning): The individual's focus is on the probability of winning rather than the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (implied focus on probability of winning): The decision reason's rule is based on expected value, not probability of winning. Given that the verbal report emphasizes probability and does not mention expected value, it suggests the individual did not directly apply the decision reason based on expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 6 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that both outcomes are very unlikely, implying they considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states ""Beide treten sehr unwahrscheinlich ein, daher geht man ein höheres Risiko ein,"" which translates to ""Both are very unlikely to occur, therefore one takes a higher risk."" This suggests the individual focused on the risk or the improbability of the outcomes rather than directly comparing the expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the improbability of the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, discusses taking a higher risk due to the low probabilities, not directly addressing the comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the risk and the improbability of the outcomes, as stated in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual's justification does not reflect a consideration of expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery B, the EV is calculated as (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the EV is -3000 Euros since it has a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a small probability of avoiding a loss and compares the potential loss of Lottery B to that of Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the aspect of avoiding loss and the comparative magnitude of loss rather than directly calculating or comparing expected values. The justification hints at a risk-averse or loss-averse perspective but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and comparative losses): The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but did not explicitly mention expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on avoiding loss and comparative loss magnitude): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of maximizing expected value.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual calculated or compared the expected values of the lotteries as the basis for their choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates a low likelihood that the decision reason based on expected values was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly support the application of this reason in the decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as: (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is: (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The report mentions ""Leicht bessere Chancen einen Verlust zu vermeiden,"" which translates to ""Slightly better chances of avoiding a loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss (or gaining nothing, in this context) in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the avoidance of loss, implying that the individual preferred the option that offered a higher probability of not losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of avoiding a loss): The individual's focus was on avoiding loss, which indirectly relates to the expected value calculation since both lotteries only have loss or no loss outcomes. However, the direct consideration of expected values (which involves multiplying outcomes by probabilities) is not explicitly mentioned.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding loss): The decision reason is based on a quantitative assessment (expected value), while the individual's justification is more qualitative (better chances of avoiding a loss). The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the expected outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and the ""slightly better chances"" of doing so does not directly align with the decision reason's emphasis on expected values. While there is a tangential relationship between avoiding loss and the expected value (since both lotteries only offer losses or no gain), the verbal report does not suggest the individual explicitly considered or compared the expected values of the two lotteries. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the basis for the decision."

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. Both lotteries have the same expected value, -2700 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the magnitude of the potential loss and the probability of avoiding it. They mention a ""höherer Verlust"" (higher loss), which refers to the -6000 Euros in Lottery B compared to -3000 Euros in Lottery A, and the higher probability of avoiding this loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher probability of avoiding the loss, not explicitly mentioning the expected value or comparing the overall value of the two options directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the low probability of incurring a loss in both lotteries. Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on ""nach Gefühl entschieden,"" which translates to ""decided by feeling."" This suggests the decision was made intuitively rather than through a systematic evaluation of the lotteries' expected values or other quantitative factors.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (low probability of loss and intuition), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual does not explicitly mention considering the expected value or a systematic comparison of the lotteries' values. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (decided by feeling), it's clear that the individual's approach does not align with the decision reason's systematic evaluation based on expected value. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value, if the individual had used the decision reason, they should have been indifferent between the two lotteries, but the verbal report does not suggest a consideration of expected values at all.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 500 Euros * 100% = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) and ""Höhe"" (height or amount), which suggests they are considering the guaranteed outcome of one of the lotteries and possibly its magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the ""sicheren Gewinn"" due to its ""Höhe"", implying they value the certainty of a gain over the potential for a higher but uncertain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, but the individual discusses the certainty and amount of the gain, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification is based on the preference for a certain gain, not directly on expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, focuses on the certainty of the gain and its amount rather than on the expected values of the lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers expected values to make a decision and the individual's justification does not align with this rule, it suggests the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is EV_B = (-500 * 1) = -500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which in this case is equal for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""Risiko"" (risk), implying consideration of the uncertainty or potential downside of the choices. However, the specific outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries are not explicitly mentioned.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states it's about whether the risk is worth it, suggesting a consideration of the trade-off between risk and potential outcomes, but does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or the specific monetary values associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk and the concept of a ""sichere Ergebnis"" or certain outcome), there seems to be a partial alignment in that both involve consideration of the lotteries' characteristics. However, the individual does not explicitly discuss expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (considering whether the risk is worth it), there is no clear alignment since the individual does not explicitly compare expected values or indicate a preference based on this criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of expected values as the basis for the decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. While there is a mention of risk, which could tangentially relate to the consideration of outcomes and probabilities, the direct comparison of expected values is not evident in the report. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely, but not entirely impossible, that the decision reason was used, leading to a low but not zero score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 + 0 = 1500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual's statement ""Kommt mir ewas sicherer vor, überhaupt was zu gewinnen"" translates to ""Seems to me something more secure, to win something at all."" This suggests the individual is considering the aspect of security or guarantee of winning something, rather than explicitly calculating expected values.

Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the perceived security of winning something, implying a preference for a lottery that offers a higher chance of winning any amount of money, rather than the highest possible payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (security of winning something): The individual's focus does not directly align with calculating expected values but rather with the assurance of winning.

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring something that seems more secure in terms of winning): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a comparison of expected values between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not seem to have used the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries. The focus is more on the psychological aspect of winning something rather than the mathematical expectation.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -1500 Euros for both Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""geringere Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""lower loss probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing (receiving a negative outcome) in their deliberation. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report does not explicitly state the justification but implies a focus on minimizing loss probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of loss). The individual's focus is on the probability of loss rather than the expected value directly. 
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (minimizing loss probability). The decision reason and the individual's justification do not align directly since the expected values are equal for both lotteries, and the individual's focus is on loss probability, not expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The final assessment is 0, indicating certainty that the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) was not used by the individual. The individual's focus, as described in the verbal report, is on minimizing loss probability, which does not align with the decision reason that considers expected values. Additionally, the equal expected values of the two lotteries mean that the decision reason would lead to indifference, which is not indicated by the individual's focus on loss probability."

For Lottery A, the expected value is 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 5000 Euros * 0.1% + 0 Euros * 99.9% = 5 Euros. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and the relevant information is that both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the winning probability of Lottery B (referred to as ""Lotterie 2""), stating it was almost 0. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for the choice, but it focuses on the low winning probability of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the expected value of the lotteries, while the individual considered the winning probability of Lottery B. The expected value calculation involves both the outcome and the probability, but the individual's focus was solely on the probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since the individual's justification is not explicitly stated and focuses on probability rather than expected value, it does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make the decision, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-5 * 1) = -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. In this case, both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringe Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""low probability of loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but implies a focus on the probability of loss rather than the expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the expected value, while the individual seems to focus on the probability of loss. Although related, these are not the same, as the expected value also considers the magnitude of the loss, not just its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's focus on ""low probability of loss"" does not directly align with comparing expected values, especially since the report does not mention considering the magnitude of the potential losses or the expected values explicitly.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report focuses on the probability of loss rather than the expected value of the lotteries, indicating that the decision reason based on expected value was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires the calculation of the expected value (EV) for each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is 1500 * 1 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the potential for a higher gain with Lottery B but also acknowledges the risk of a significant loss. They seem to consider the trade-off between the potential gain and the risk of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing the ""sichere Ergebnis"" (secure outcome), implying they prioritize certainty over the potential for a higher gain that comes with a risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential gain, risk of loss, and the value of a secure outcome). While the individual does not explicitly mention expected values, their consideration of potential gain and loss implies an intuitive understanding of the concept.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the secure outcome because of the risk associated with the other option). The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A because it has a higher expected value than Lottery B. The individual chooses Lottery A but seems to do so based on the desire for a secure outcome rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason that focuses on expected values. The individual's choice is influenced by the desire for a secure outcome and the avoidance of risk, rather than an explicit comparison of expected values. While the outcome of their decision happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery A), the underlying reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason regarding expected values. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. 
For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the expected value is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 0 Euros for Lottery A and 2000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. 
The individual considers the risk of loss and gain in Lottery A and compares it to the certainty of a high amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The individual seems to be weighing the uncertainty of Lottery A against the certainty of a high amount in Lottery B, indicating a consideration of the trade-off between risk and guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. 
The decision reason relies on the expected values, while the individual discusses risk and certainty, which indirectly relates to the expected outcomes but does not directly mention expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification hints at preferring certainty over risk, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but does not explicitly mention expected value as the criterion.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision might align with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not directly mention considering expected values as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus on risk and certainty suggests an influence of these factors rather than a straightforward application of expected value calculation. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there's a slight inclination towards it not being the primary reason due to the lack of explicit mention of expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 1000 Euros * 1 = 1000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. The expected value of Lottery A is 0 Euros, and the expected value of Lottery B is 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""fares Risiko bei A"" which translates to ""fair risk at A"", indicating an awareness of the risk associated with Lottery A. They also mention ""der sichere Gewinn bei B"" which translates to ""the safe gain at B"", showing they considered the certain outcome of Lottery B. However, the phrase ""das Risiko für A gerne in Kauf nimmt"" translates to ""takes the risk of A gladly"", suggesting the individual is willing to take on the risk associated with Lottery A despite acknowledging the certainty of the gain from Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to weigh the risk of Lottery A against the certain but lower gain of Lottery B, implying a consideration of the trade-off between risk and reward rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of A, certain gain of B). While the individual discusses aspects related to risk and certainty, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (seems to prioritize taking on risk for a potentially higher gain over a certain but lower gain). The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its positive expected value compared to Lottery A's expected value of 0. However, the individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, as they express a willingness to take on the risk of Lottery A, which does not directly indicate a comparison based on expected values.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus is more on the risk and the attractiveness of the potential gain rather than a calculated comparison of expected outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) was used by the individual, given the lack of explicit consideration of expected values in the verbal report and a decision-making process that seems to prioritize risk tolerance over expected value calculation."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (6000 Euros * 0.5) + (-6000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 0 Euros * 1 = 0 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""ZU großes Verlustrisiko bei A,"" which translates to ""Too high loss risk at A."" This indicates the individual considered the risk of loss associated with Lottery A. The individual’s justification for the choice focuses on the risk aspect, specifically the potential for a large loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss), it appears the individual focused more on the risk aspect rather than calculating or directly comparing expected values. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding high loss risk), the individual's reasoning does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the risk of loss rather than the expected value of the lotteries, and the lack of explicit comparison or consideration of the expected values in the verbal report, suggests that the decision reason based on expected value was not used by the individual."
