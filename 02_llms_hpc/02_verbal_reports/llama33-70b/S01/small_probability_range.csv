STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100% for all outcomes, so the difference is 100% - 100% = 0%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (65%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with a 100% chance of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered amounts and probabilities but did not specify comparing the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chose Lottery B but justified it by its 100% winning chance, not the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (choosing Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the reason for the choice. Instead, the choice is justified by the 100% winning chance of Lottery B. This suggests that while the outcome matches the decision reason, the process described does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria, leading to uncertainty about whether the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, so the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, so the difference is 66% - 34% = 32%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are 34% for Lottery A and 32% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to achieve a gain, implying they focused on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probability differences) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains): The individual considered probabilities, which is part of the information needed for the decision reason, but there's no direct mention of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (chose based on the likelihood of achieving a gain): The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as they focused on the probability of winning rather than the difference between the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Their justification for the choice is based on the likelihood of winning, not on comparing the probability ranges of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%.
- Lottery B has a probability difference of 60%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered outcomes and probabilities, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason (probability differences).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that a win is certain, which indirectly aligns with having the smallest possible difference in probabilities (since a certain outcome has a probability difference of 0%).

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A due to its certain outcome, which corresponds to the smallest probability difference), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the emphasis on choosing a lottery with a certain win could imply an implicit consideration of probability stability or certainty, which is closely related to the concept of probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects a moderate level of certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome the decision reason would suggest, but the explicit consideration of probability differences as stated in the decision reason is not directly mentioned in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 25%. The differences are 20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts (Beträge) that could be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher potential winning amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (amounts that could be won): The individual did not mention considering the probabilities or their differences, which are crucial for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose the lottery with the higher potential winning amount): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the focus was on the winning amounts, not the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision was based on the potential winning amounts, not the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, so the difference is 55% - 45% = 10%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, so the difference is 90% - 10% = 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts and probabilities of the lotteries and chose the one where a win is more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the overall probability of winning, not specifically the difference between the probabilities of the outcomes within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is about choosing the lottery where a win is more probable, which aligns with comparing the probabilities of winning but does not directly address the difference between the probabilities of outcomes within each lottery.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the overall probability of winning, not the internal probability differences within each lottery.

6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.2%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 6000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the contributions (or outcomes) and probabilities of both lotteries and noted that the probability of winning is similarly low for both.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that promises a higher win because the probabilities of winning are similarly low for both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the outcomes and the similarity in low winning probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (0.1% difference). However, the individual's justification is based on choosing the lottery with the higher potential win due to similarly low winning probabilities, not on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's justification is based on the potential win and the similarity in low probabilities, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% (since there is only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities, focusing on the possibility of not incurring a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that has the possibility of not incurring a loss and did not find the difference between a loss of 3000 and 4000 Euros to be significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about the difference in probabilities, but the individual focused on the possibility of not incurring a loss and the difference in potential losses, not directly on the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing probability differences but rather the potential for no loss and the perceived insignificance of the difference between the two potential losses.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Instead, the focus was on avoiding loss and the relative significance of different loss amounts, suggesting that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, also resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities (50% for A and 60% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where it is more likely to not incur a loss. This implies the individual focused on the probability of avoiding a loss (i.e., the probability of the 0 Euro outcome).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered all outcomes and probabilities but specifically mentions the likelihood of not incurring a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% difference). However, the individual's justification is about avoiding loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A because it has a higher probability (75%) of not incurring a loss compared to Lottery B (80% of not incurring a loss, but the decision reason itself is not about direct loss avoidance). The individual's focus on avoiding loss indirectly aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring A over B due to its smaller probability difference), but the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on the likelihood of avoiding a loss, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the probabilities of the outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% and the maximum probability is 55%, resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% and the maximum probability is 90%, resulting in a difference of 80%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities and chose the lottery where it is more probable to not incur a loss. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the probability of not incurring a loss, which implies considering the probability of the 0 Euros outcome for each lottery. The individual seems to prioritize avoiding a loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the probability of not incurring a loss), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason specifically looks at the range of probabilities within each lottery, while the individual's focus is on avoiding a loss, which relates more directly to the specific probabilities of outcomes rather than their range. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 10% difference. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities but rather the likelihood of avoiding a loss, which aligns more with the probabilities of the specific outcomes rather than their differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the conclusion that the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss, which does not directly relate to comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities and gains of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice focuses on selecting the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and gains, focusing on not incurring a loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the specific information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of not incurring a loss), the two do not align. The individual's justification is about minimizing loss, not about comparing probability ranges.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery A has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery B (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions looking at all probabilities and amounts, indicating they considered the key aspects of both lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win definitely occurs, which refers to Lottery A, as it offers a 100% chance of winning 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason that also focuses on probabilities (specifically, the range of probabilities for each lottery).
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it offers a definite win, which indirectly aligns with having a smaller (zero) difference in probabilities since there's no variability in the outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on a definite win (which is a result of Lottery A having no variability in its outcome probability) aligns with the preference for the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the range or difference of probabilities between the lotteries as the reason for the choice. Instead, it emphasizes the certainty of the outcome. This suggests that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer, the explicit reasoning process described does not perfectly match the decision reason's criteria.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well, since there is only one probability value.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual made a risk decision, considering the possibility of not incurring a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered probabilities but the report does not specifically mention comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a difference of 0%. The individual's justification is about making a risk decision to avoid loss, not directly related to comparing probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual used the specific decision reason regarding the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50%. The difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 75%. The difference is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities of the lotteries and compared the number of events promising a gain despite having the same probabilities of a gain compared to the other lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with more events that promise a gain, considering the same probabilities of a gain in comparison to the other lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 0.1%, resulting in a difference of 0.1%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0.1%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is definitely expected. This implies they were looking for a certain or guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual considered probabilities, there's no explicit mention of comparing the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing a lottery where a win is definitely expected aligns with choosing Lottery A because it offers a 100% chance of winning, but this does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the probability difference.

The individual's choice and justification align with the outcome of applying the decision reason (both prefer Lottery A), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a coincidence in the choice, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of the specified decision reason."

Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (choosing the lottery where it is more probable to not incur a loss), the individual's approach does not align with calculating and comparing the differences in probability ranges. Instead, the individual focused on the practical outcome of avoiding a loss, which is more directly related to the expected outcome rather than the range of probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and amounts of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of having a certain win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since both lotteries have a difference of 0% in their minimum and maximum probabilities, the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification was based on having a certain win, not on comparing the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report indicates the individual's decision was based on the certainty of a win, not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where a win is expected with certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but does not specify looking at the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a difference of 0%. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of a win, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, was used to make the decision. The focus on certainty of a win does not align with the decision reason's specific criteria, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well (since there's only one probability value). However, interpreting the reason strictly, it seems to look for a difference within each lottery's set of probabilities. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Difference = 0% (50% - 50%)
- Lottery B: Difference = 0% (since there's no range, just a single probability of 100%)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they could achieve a certain win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not explicitly discuss the range of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a difference of 0%. However, the individual's justification is about achieving a certain win, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus was on achieving a certain win, which suggests a different decision-making criterion. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the difference in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at all contributions (outcomes) and probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery that seemed safe, ensuring no loss would be incurred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but did not mention comparing the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification is about avoiding loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly relate to comparing probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding loss and ensuring safety does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about probability differences. However, since both lotteries have the same difference in probabilities (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries based on its rule. The individual's choice of Lottery A for safety reasons does not contradict the decision reason but also does not directly reflect its application.
