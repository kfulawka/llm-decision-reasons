STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery A, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the probabilities are given, we can proceed to evaluate the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the guaranteed high amount in Lottery A, the potential for a slightly higher amount in Lottery B, and the risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B. They also considered the difference in winnings between the two lotteries as minimal but certain in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by noting the certainty of a high amount in Lottery A, the minimal difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries, and the absence of risk in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the certainty and amounts of the winnings, as well as the risk involved, but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A due to its certainty and minimal risk, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly address the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process shares some intuitive similarities with the decision reason, such as preferring a certain positive outcome over a riskier one with slightly higher potential rewards. However, the explicit calculation and comparison based on an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason are not clearly described in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process involves considerations that might align with the general intuition behind the decision reason (e.g., preferring certainty and being risk-averse), there is no clear indication that the specific rule of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences was used. The verbal report focuses more on the certainty of the outcome and the minimal difference in potential winnings rather than on the probabilities of exceeding a calculated aspiration level."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros, 0 Euros, 2500 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2400 + 0 + 2500 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 2400 - 1225 = 1175, 0 - 1225 = -1225, 2500 - 1225 = 1275, and 0 - 1225 = -1225. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 34% (since only the 2400 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it is 33% (since only the 2500 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers that both lotteries are almost the same in terms of amounts and chances. They note that Lottery B offers a slightly higher potential win with nearly the same chance. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the potential gain and the similarity in chances between the two lotteries, mentioning the higher potential win of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes above this level. The individual, however, discusses the similarity in chances and the potential for a higher win in Lottery B without mentioning an aspiration level or explicit comparison of probabilities of being above a certain threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the potential for a higher win and similar chances, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of exceeding such levels.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The focus is on the potential win and the similarity in chances, suggesting a different basis for the decision. Therefore, I am certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference (666.67 Euros) and Lottery B has an 80% chance of a positive difference (1666.67 Euros) and a 20% chance of a negative difference (-2333.33 Euros), we can apply this reason to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A, the high chance of winning and the higher amount of Lottery B, and the non-negligible chance of receiving nothing in Lottery B. They also considered the difference in winnings between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the certainty of Lottery A over the risk of potentially getting nothing in Lottery B, despite the higher potential payout of Lottery B. They seemed to prioritize security over the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of the differences in winnings and the certainty vs. risk of the lotteries touches upon the concept of preferring outcomes based on their differences but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A in this case because it guarantees a positive difference (from the aspiration level), albeit smaller. The individual's justification prioritizes the certainty of a gain, which aligns with preferring a guaranteed positive outcome over a risky one but does not directly address the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's focus on certainty and the difference in winnings aligns somewhat with the decision reason's emphasis on the probability of positive differences. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing the probabilities of positive differences as per the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the preference for guaranteed outcomes, the explicit process described by the decision reason is not clearly evident in the individual's justification, leading to a score below the midpoint."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 4000 - 1750 = 2250, 0 - 1750 = -1750, 3000 - 1750 = 1250, and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it is 25% (since only the 3000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery B based on the calculated aspiration level and the probabilities of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery involves a loss, the probabilities of winning are roughly equal, but Lottery A has a slightly lower chance of winning with a higher potential gain.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the comparison of the win probabilities and the amounts to be won, without explicitly mentioning the concept of an aspiration level or the specific calculation of differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from it, and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (win probabilities, amounts to be won, and the fact that neither involves a loss), there seems to be a partial overlap in that both consider the outcomes and their probabilities, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification (focusing on win probabilities and amounts), there is no direct match since the individual does not discuss the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the aspiration level or the comparison of positive differences from it, which are central to the decision reason. While the individual considers the probabilities and outcomes, the specific reasoning process outlined in the decision reason is not clearly reflected in the verbal report. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner described."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information for the decision reason: 
- Aspiration level: 2250 Euros
- Differences between outcomes and aspiration level for Lottery A: 3750, -2250
- Differences between outcomes and aspiration level for Lottery B: 750, -2250
- Probabilities of positive differences: for Lottery A, 45% (since 6000 is a positive difference), and for Lottery B, 90% (since 3000 is a positive difference).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers that neither lottery results in a loss, the gain in Lottery A is twice as high as in Lottery B but much less probable, and the gain in Lottery B is still very good and very probable.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to weigh the potential gains against their probabilities, noting the higher gain of Lottery A but also its lower probability, and the lower but more probable gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the gains and their probabilities, which aligns with the components needed to calculate the aspiration level and assess the probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing the probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between the size of the gain and its probability, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive differences but does not explicitly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences as defined.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process shares some elements with the decision reason, such as considering gains and probabilities, but does not directly apply the specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities.

The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2250 = 3750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250; for Lottery B, 3000 - 2250 = 750 and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference (3750), and Lottery B has a 0.2% probability of a positive difference (750). Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning is very small for both lotteries and that, if one wins, Lottery A offers twice as much as Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual does not explicitly state their justification but highlights the key differences between the two lotteries, focusing on the potential winnings and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the absolute winnings and the low probabilities without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its higher probability (0.2%) of a positive outcome compared to Lottery A (0.1%). The individual's justification, as described, does not explicitly align with this rule, instead focusing on the magnitude of the winnings if one were to win.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, which are central to the decision reason. The focus on the magnitude of potential winnings and the low probabilities of winning does not align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 + (-3000)) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 Euros and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33 Euros; for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss at Lottery A, the higher loss at Lottery B, and the small chance of not losing anything at Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by comparing the difference in loss amounts and the potential to not lose anything at Lottery B, considering it worth the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the losses and the chance of not losing, which relates to the concept of differences from a reference point (in this case, not losing), but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the chance to not lose anything at Lottery B as a factor in their decision. However, the individual's justification focuses more on the comparison of loss amounts and the risk associated with the chance of not losing, rather than explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (considering the potential for not losing as a positive aspect), it does not directly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from a calculated aspiration level. The individual's focus on the risk and comparison of losses introduces uncertainty about whether the decision reason was used as defined."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -4000, 0, -3000, and 0, which is (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1750) = -2250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1750) = -1250 and 0 - (-1750) = 1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 1750 with probabilities of 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain, the loss in Lottery A is higher, and although the probability of loss is higher in Lottery B, it does not compensate for the difference in loss magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the magnitude of the loss and the probability of the loss, suggesting that the justification is based on a comparison of these factors between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level but do compare loss magnitudes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 80% probability of a ""positive difference"" (0 Euros being a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level), compared to Lottery B's 75%. However, the individual's justification seems to weigh the magnitude of loss against the probability of loss without explicitly considering the concept of an aspiration level or the preference for the higher probability of positive outcomes relative to this level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on an aspiration level and the preference for the higher probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual considers loss magnitudes and probabilities, the specific rule and information considered by the decision reason are not explicitly mentioned, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision. However, the consideration of probabilities and outcomes indicates some overlap, preventing a complete dismissal of the decision reason's influence."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0% (since the only non-zero outcome is negative and its difference with the aspiration level is also negative), and for Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 55% (since the zero outcome has a positive difference with the aspiration level and occurs with 55% probability). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high loss amount in both lotteries but notes that Lottery A has a high probability of losing a significant amount, whereas Lottery B offers a chance to end up with 0 Euros (""Mit etwas Glück geht man bei B mit 0 raus""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential for avoiding loss in Lottery B against the more probable but still significant loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the probabilities and amounts of losses but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. However, the individual does consider the probability of avoiding loss (ending up with 0 Euros) in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the outcomes relative to a reference point (like the aspiration level).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 55% chance of resulting in 0 Euros (a positive difference from the aspiration level). The individual’s justification seems to lean towards preferring Lottery B because it offers a chance to avoid loss, which indirectly aligns with seeking a positive outcome relative to an implied reference point (avoiding loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention the aspiration level or explicitly state a preference based on the probability of positive differences from this level. However, the individual's focus on avoiding loss and the chance of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery B indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. This indirect alignment and the lack of explicit mention of the aspiration level or its calculation lead to a moderate assessment that the decision reason might have influenced the individual's choice, but it is not certain."

STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-2250) = -750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since both lotteries have a positive difference of 2250 with a probability of nearly 100% (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B), we need to focus on the negative differences and their probabilities. Lottery A has a -3750 difference with 0.1% probability, and Lottery B has a -750 difference with 0.2% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing something in both lotteries, which is approximately equally low, and the amount lost in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by mentioning that the difference in the probability of losing does not make much of a difference, but emphasized that with Lottery B, one loses less.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive and negative differences from this level. The individual considered the probability of losing and the amount lost, which aligns with considering negative differences but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences or, in cases where both have the same positive difference probability, considers the negative differences. The individual's justification focuses on the lower loss amount in Lottery B and the negligible difference in probabilities, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's consideration of negative differences but does not explicitly follow the rule regarding positive differences or aspiration levels.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of loss amounts and the negligible difference in probabilities shows some alignment with the aspects of the decision reason concerning negative outcomes. However, the explicit calculation of aspiration levels, consideration of positive differences, and the specific rule for preferring one lottery over the other based on these factors are not mentioned in the verbal report. Thus, while there's a slight connection in the concern for losses, the decision reason's core components are not clearly reflected in the individual's deliberation process as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 1000 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 500 Euros

The aspiration level = (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 500 - 500 = 0

The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (because its outcome equals the aspiration level), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A based on the rule provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of the gain with Lottery B and the higher potential gain with Lottery A, along with the risk of receiving nothing.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to weigh the certainty of the gain in Lottery B against the potential higher gain in Lottery A, noting the risk of getting nothing with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the certainty and potential gain of each lottery but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above this level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the trade-off between the certainty of a gain and the potential for a higher gain, without explicitly discussing probabilities of exceeding a specific aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual does not seem to explicitly use the decision reason as described, especially since there's no mention of calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. However, the individual does consider the trade-offs that could implicitly relate to the concept of aspiration levels and risk, but the process described does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -1000, 0, and -500 Euros, which equals (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 Euros and 0 - (-500) = 500 Euros; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (500 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the loss amount in both lotteries and the probability of not losing anything in Lottery A. Specifically, they mention that the loss in Lottery A is twice as high as in Lottery B, but there's a 50/50 chance of not losing anything in Lottery A. They also note that the amount lost in Lottery B is quite high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential loss against the chance of avoiding loss. They acknowledge the higher potential loss in Lottery A but also consider the possibility of no loss. The justification focuses on the comparison of loss amounts and the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the uncertainty in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the losses and the chance of no loss but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, while focusing on the potential for no loss in Lottery A, does not directly address the concept of aspiration levels or the preference for positive differences from such a level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual does consider the potential benefits (avoiding loss) and weighs them against the risks, which could be seen as indirectly related to the concept of preferring positive outcomes. The direct application of the decision reason, as defined, is not clearly evident in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 12000 / 5 = 2400 Euros. This is a relevant piece of information for applying the decision reason. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, (4000-2400), (2000-2400), (0-2400), and for Lottery B, (6000-2400), (0-2400). These differences are (1600, -400, -2400) for Lottery A and (3600, -2400) for Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considers the amounts won in Lottery A to be ""geringer"" (lower) but ""viel wahrscheinlicher"" (much more probable). The individual also mentions that the amounts in Lottery A are ""hoch und in Ordnung"" (high and okay), preferring this to the high risk of receiving nothing in Lottery B. This suggests the individual is considering the trade-off between the size of the outcomes and their probabilities, focusing on the higher probability of winning in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) to that considered by the individual (probability of winning and size of outcomes), there is a partial alignment. The individual does consider the probability of winning and the size of the outcomes, which are key components in understanding the decision reason's focus on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing the probabilities of positive differences between the lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the preference for higher probability of winning over the risk of receiving nothing, which aligns with preferring a lottery based on the probability of positive outcomes but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision-making process shares some elements with the decision reason (considering probabilities and outcome sizes), it does not directly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's focus is more on the general trade-off between outcome size and probability rather than the specific calculation and comparison implied by the decision reason."
14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, we will follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. For Lottery B, the differences are -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 Euros and 0 - (-2200) = 2200 Euros. For Lottery A, the differences are -4000 - (-2200) = -1800 Euros, -2000 - (-2200) = 200 Euros, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, a positive difference occurs in Lottery B with 75% probability (since the 0 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level) and in Lottery A with 50% + 25% = 75% probability (since both the 0 Euro and -2000 Euro outcomes are above the aspiration level, but only the 0 Euro outcome and potentially the -2000 Euro outcome could be considered as having a ""positive difference"" in a broad sense, yet given the context, we focus on outcomes strictly above the aspiration level for a clear positive difference, which applies to the 0 Euro outcome). Thus, the decision reason can be applied, but the calculation of positive differences and their probabilities needs careful consideration based on the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain and compares the loss amounts and their probabilities between the two lotteries. They mention that Lottery B has a higher loss sum but also notes it is less probable, and that the amounts in Lottery A are high but with a relatively probable chance. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice, focusing on the described deliberation process. The individual seems to weigh the magnitude of losses against their probabilities, acknowledging the higher potential loss in Lottery B but also its lower probability, and considering the losses in Lottery A as high but with a notable probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences from the aspiration level, and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (loss amounts, probabilities, and a comparative assessment of these factors). The individual does consider the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level. Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification (comparing loss amounts and their probabilities without explicit reference to an aspiration level or positive differences from it). Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process involves considering the probability and magnitude of losses but does not explicitly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of an aspiration level or the calculation of positive differences from it as a basis for the decision. While the individual considers probabilities and outcomes, the specific decision reason provided does not seem to be explicitly applied in their deliberation process. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, but given the complexity of human decision-making and the possibility of implicit considerations, the assessment is not a complete certainty, hence a score of 20 rather than 0."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5000 - 1671.67 ≈ 3328.33 Euros and 0 - 1671.67 ≈ -1671.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 5 - 1671.67 ≈ -1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference and a 99.9% chance of a negative difference, and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since its outcome is below the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the small gain of Lottery B, the small chance of winning something with Lottery A, and the fact that receiving nothing (no gain, no loss) does not make a big difference in this case.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the certain but small gain of Lottery B against the uncertain but potentially significant gain of Lottery A, considering the aspect of not receiving anything as not being a significant factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level, but they do consider the outcomes and their implications (e.g., the small chance of winning something significant).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual’s justification does not explicitly follow this rule, instead focusing on the size of the potential gains and the certainty of one option versus the uncertainty of the other.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. While the individual considers the outcomes and their implications, the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level is not evident in their justification. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility that some aspects of the reasoning might align indirectly."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -5 Euros, -5000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5 + (-5000) + 0) / 3 = -5005 / 3 = -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -5 Euros, the difference is 1666.67 Euros; for -5000 Euros, the difference is -3328.33 Euros; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 1671.67 Euros. Since the decision reason considers the probability of positive differences, we need to assess which lottery has a higher probability of outcomes that are above the aspiration level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the information that neither lottery offers a gain, but Lottery A has a small loss, while Lottery B has a very low chance of a high loss. Second, the individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for a small certain loss over a potential high loss, even if the chance of the high loss is very low, as indicated by ""Bei dem Betrag nehme ich lieber einen kleinen Verlust in Kauf"" (""I'd rather accept a small loss in this case"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (small loss in A, high but low-probability loss in B), it seems the individual focuses on the losses rather than calculating an aspiration level explicitly. However, the concern for the magnitude of potential losses aligns with considering differences from an aspiration level, albeit implicitly. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual's justification (preferring a small certain loss), there's an alignment in the sense that both involve weighing the desirability of outcomes based on their potential for loss or gain, but the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities of being above an aspiration level. The individual's reasoning seems more focused on risk aversion regarding the magnitude of potential losses rather than explicitly calculating probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there are elements of the decision reason present in the individual's thought process, such as considering the magnitude of losses, the explicit application of the aspiration level and the calculation of probabilities of positive differences are not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems more driven by a general risk aversion and preference for certain outcomes over highly uncertain ones, rather than the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
To apply the decision reason, we first need to calculate the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (1500 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0. 
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 
- For Lottery A: 1500 - 0 = 1500
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 0 = 3000 and -3000 - 0 = -3000
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is 0, positive differences are those greater than 0.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A (""Bei A gewinnt man auf jeden Fall und nicht wenig"") and the risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery B (""Bei B gibt es zu 50% die Chance, viel zu verlieren"").

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified the choice by stating that the risk associated with Lottery B is too high (""Das Risiko ist zu hoch"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the guaranteed win of one lottery and the risk (specifically, the chance to lose) of the other, which aligns with considering outcomes relative to a reference point (like the aspiration level) but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the risk of losing being too high, which implies a concern for negative outcomes but does not directly address the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process involved considering the risk and the guaranteed outcome, which is somewhat aligned with the concept of the decision reason (focusing on positive outcomes and avoiding negative ones) but does not directly apply the specific rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 = 666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 2333.33 (3000 - 666.67), -3666.67 (-3000 - 666.67), and 1333.33 (2000 - 666.67). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certain gain of Lottery A as very high and notes that Lottery B offers a higher gain but only with 50% certainty and also carries a significant loss with the same probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the certainty of the gain in Lottery A against the riskier but potentially higher gain (and loss) in Lottery B, emphasizing the security aspect of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual discusses the certainty and magnitude of gains and losses but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or calculate probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual seems to prefer the certain gain, which could be interpreted as focusing on the positive difference from a certain reference point (perhaps implicitly the aspiration level), but this is not explicitly stated.

Given these comparisons, the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, as calculated in Step 1. However, the emphasis on certainty and the avoidance of potential loss suggests the individual might be influenced by the concept of maintaining or exceeding a certain threshold (aspiration level), even if not explicitly stated.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason, as defined by the aspiration level and preference for the higher probability of positive differences, was directly used by the individual. The individual's focus on certainty and risk avoidance suggests some alignment with concepts related to aspiration levels, but the explicit calculation and comparison of probabilities of positive differences from the aspiration level are not mentioned, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 0. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason includes the aspiration level (0) and the differences between each outcome and this aspiration level. For Lottery A, the differences are 3000 and -3000. For Lottery B, the difference is 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (3000) and Lottery B has a 100% probability of a positive difference (1000), this information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery B, the smaller but still satisfactory amount of 1000 Euros, and the high risk of losing a significant amount with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it guarantees a win, even though the amount is smaller than the potential win in Lottery A, and because the risk of losing with Lottery A is too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B, the risk of loss in Lottery A, and the amount of potential wins. While the individual did not explicitly mention an aspiration level or calculate differences from it, they did consider the risk and the guaranteed nature of the outcomes, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences from a reference point (though not explicitly stated as an aspiration level).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a win (a positive outcome) and avoids the high risk of loss (a negative outcome) associated with Lottery A. This aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome over a risky one that could result in a significant loss, which is consistent with the decision reason’s preference for a higher probability of positive differences, albeit not explicitly framed in terms of aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not directly mention the aspiration level or explicitly apply the decision reason's rule, their justification for choosing Lottery B (guaranteed win, avoidance of high risk of loss) aligns with the spirit of preferring outcomes that ensure positive differences from a reference point (in this case, not losing), which is a key aspect of the decision reason. However, the lack of explicit mention of the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences prevents a higher assessment of certainty that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 - 6000 + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for the outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), this reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the fact that with Lottery B, one wins nothing but also loses nothing, implying consideration of the risk-free nature of Lottery B. They also mention the high potential loss with Lottery A, indicating an awareness of the risk associated with this option.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the avoidance of loss, highlighting the risk associated with Lottery A and the safety of Lottery B. They do not explicitly mention probabilities of positive or negative outcomes but emphasize the riskiness of Lottery A due to its potential for significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as reported, focus on the risk of loss and the safety of not losing, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences from an aspiration level (in this case, zero, as it is the outcome of Lottery B and the aspiration level calculated in Step 1). However, the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities of positive outcomes or an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's justification, while not explicitly discussing probabilities of positive outcomes, implies a preference for avoiding negative outcomes (losses), which could align with preferring a lottery that minimizes the risk of being below a certain aspiration level (in this case, zero). However, the individual's focus is more on the avoidance of loss rather than the pursuit of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's decision process shares some elements with the decision reason (such as considering the impact of potential losses), it does not directly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The individual's emphasis is on risk avoidance rather than on the probability of exceeding an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as described, given the lack of explicit consideration of an aspiration level and the focus on risk avoidance rather than the probability of positive differences. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's concerns about loss indirectly relate to the concept of deviations from an aspiration level."
