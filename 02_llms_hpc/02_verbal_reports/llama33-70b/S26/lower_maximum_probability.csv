STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for the 2400 Euros outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2400 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This information is: Lottery B has a maximum probability of 66%, and Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected value of each lottery, and compared these expected values to make a decision. They also mention considering the 1% probability of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B as negligible.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the lottery with the higher expected value and considered the risk associated with the 1% chance of winning 0 Euros in Lottery B as acceptable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the expected values and the specific probabilities of each outcome, including the risk associated with the low-probability outcome in Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (66% maximum probability) over Lottery A (100% maximum probability). However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value and their willingness to take on the risk associated with Lottery B, not directly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability to make their decision. Instead, they focused on expected values and risk tolerance.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (probability of 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 67% (probability of 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the worst outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries and then calculated the expected value of each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the lottery with the higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the worst outcomes) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and expected values). The individual considered more information than just the maximum probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value). The decision reason and the individual’s justification are based on different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of the worst outcome, while the individual's decision was based on the expected value of each lottery, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100% (for the outcome of 3000 Euros), and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 80% (for the outcome of 4000 Euros). Since the relevant information (maximum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 100%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 80%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values, and thought about the sufficiency of the guaranteed amount (3000 Euros) from Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the sufficiency of the guaranteed amount (3000 Euros) and the reluctance to risk this amount for an additional potential 1000 Euros, especially considering that the lottery cannot be repeated to exploit the higher expected value of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned as a factor in the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of calculating expected values and evaluating risk, not specifically comparing maximum probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (80%) over Lottery A (100%). However, the individual chose Lottery A, but not because of comparing maximum probabilities. Instead, the choice was based on the sufficiency of the guaranteed amount and risk aversion regarding the potential additional gain.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason (comparing maximum probabilities) to make the decision. The individual's focus was on expected values, risk, and the sufficiency of the guaranteed outcome, rather than on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. According to the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a lower maximum probability (75%) compared to Lottery A (80%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at the winnings and their corresponding probabilities for each lottery and then calculated the expected value of each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the lottery with the higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the expected values, which involve both the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, whereas the individual chose the lottery with the higher expected value. These are fundamentally different criteria.

Based on these comparisons, it's clear that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability to make the decision. The individual's focus was on expected values, not on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for 3000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 55%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 90%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the outcomes and their respective probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values, and compared them. They also considered their personal satisfaction with the potential winnings and how these winnings would impact their life.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification is based on the expected values being equal but decides based on personal satisfaction and the impact of the winnings on their life, not directly on the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's consideration process as a deciding factor.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, but the individual's justification does not directly relate to comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Instead, it focuses on personal satisfaction and life impact.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their respective probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values, and noted that the expected values are equal. The individual also considered the personal satisfaction with the potential outcomes, specifically mentioning the attractiveness of the 3000 Euros as a ""großen Glückspliz"" (great luck).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite equal expected values, they preferred the doubled chance of winning 3000 Euros, indicating a preference for the higher probability of the non-zero outcome, not directly addressing the maximum probability of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability (which is the probability of the 0 Euro outcome in both lotteries), but the individual's consideration was more focused on the non-zero outcomes and their probabilities, along with personal satisfaction and expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability (which would be Lottery A with 99.8% for 0 Euros), but the individual's justification does not directly reference the maximum probabilities or compare them as the basis for the decision. Instead, the decision was based on the preference for a doubled chance of a non-zero outcome and personal satisfaction.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision was based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason suggests. Instead, the decision was influenced by the comparison of non-zero outcome probabilities and personal satisfaction, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their respective probabilities for both lotteries and calculated the expected value for each.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification was based on choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, but with a mistake in interpreting ""higher"" as the higher absolute value of the expected outcome, which led to a reevaluation of their initial choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered outcomes and probabilities but focused on expected values rather than the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification was based on expected values, not directly on the comparison of maximum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on expected values and not on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, both lotteries have their maximum probabilities associated with the 0 Euro outcome (80% for Lottery B and 75% for Lottery A). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Specifically, Lottery B has a maximum probability of 80%, and Lottery A has a maximum probability of 75%. Since 75% is less than 80%, according to the decision reason, Lottery A would be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculating the expected value of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on which lottery would result in the least debt on average, implying a consideration of expected outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the expected value, which takes into account all outcomes and their probabilities, not just the maximum probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, whereas the individual preferred the lottery that would result in the least debt on average, based on expected values.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason and the individual's justification for the choice do not align. The individual's process involved calculating expected values and choosing based on which resulted in less debt on average, rather than focusing solely on the maximum probability of each lottery as the decision reason dictates.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values, and noted that both lotteries have a strong negative impact on their life.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on avoiding the negative impact by hoping to escape the situation through reduced probability, implying a consideration of the probabilities of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on maximum probabilities. However, the decision reason specifically looks at the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a deciding factor.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, but the individual's justification is more about escaping negative outcomes through lower probabilities without explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual considered probabilities but did not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual compared the maximum probabilities to make the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual considered probabilities, which is a component of the decision reason, there is no clear evidence that the decision reason's specific rule (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability) was used to make the decision. The individual's focus was more on the negative impact and the hope to avoid it through reduced probability, rather than explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 99.9% (for 0 Euros). Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, the relevant information here is that both lotteries have their highest probabilities associated with the 0 Euro outcome, but Lottery B has a slightly higher maximum probability (99.9% vs 99.8%). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at the outcomes and their associated probabilities for both lotteries, noting that both have the same expected value. They also considered the potential loss in case of an ""extremen Unglücksfall"" (extreme bad luck case), comparing the loss of 3000 Euros in Lottery A to 6000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the potential loss, preferring the lottery with the lesser loss (3000 Euros) because both outcomes are very unlikely, and they are more willing to pay 3000 Euros than 6000 Euros in the case of extreme bad luck.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, expected values, and potential losses), it's clear the individual did consider the probabilities but focused more on the potential losses and the fact that both lotteries have the same expected value.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (prefer the lottery with the lesser loss because of the unlikelihood of the outcomes), it seems the individual did not directly apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability. Instead, they were influenced by the potential loss amount, which is not directly related to the decision reason provided.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of the lotteries, but the individual's justification for their choice was based on the comparison of potential losses in extreme cases and the unlikelihood of the outcomes, not on the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome of 500 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. Since Lottery A has a lower maximum probability, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A if it strictly follows the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries and calculated the expected values. They noted that the expected values are equal but emphasized the guaranteed nature of the 500 Euros from Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the guaranteed 500 Euros are sufficient and preferred not to risk a 50/50 chance for potentially more (or nothing) with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered probabilities but focused more on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% vs. 100%). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the guarantee of 500 Euros and a preference to avoid risk, not the comparison of maximum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they prioritized the guaranteed outcome and risk avoidance over the comparison of maximum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of -500 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of -1000 Euros and 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their respective probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values for both lotteries, and found them to be equal. The individual also considered the personal impact of potential gains and losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the personal value of potential gains and losses rather than directly on the probabilities or the expected values, which were found to be equal. The individual mentions being very satisfied with 1500€ and implies a diminishing marginal utility for additional euros, suggesting a focus on the personal impact of the outcomes rather than the decision reason's focus on maximum probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification does not mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as a basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason, which is based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, was used to make the decision. The report focuses on expected values and personal utility of outcomes rather than the maximum probabilities, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This information is: Lottery A has a maximum probability of 50%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 75%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual started by examining each lottery's outcomes and their corresponding probabilities, then calculated the expected value of each lottery. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the expected values being equal but considered the impact of the outcomes on their life, concluding that the influence of gaining 2000/4000 Euros versus 6000 Euros was not as significant as gaining something (2000/4000 Euros) versus nothing, leading them to avoid additional risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and expected values), it appears the individual considered more detailed information than just the maximum probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (avoiding additional risk due to the impact of outcomes on their life), the individual's justification does not directly mention or imply comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the basis for their decision.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability as the primary basis for their choice. The individual's decision was influenced by the expected values and the perceived impact of the outcomes on their life, rather than a straightforward comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

14,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Maximum probability of 75% for 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: Maximum probability of 50% for 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values (which were found to be equal), and thought about the dramatic impact of negative outcomes on their life.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite both lotteries having the same expected value, the potential negative consequences of Lottery A were deemed too dramatic, and the compensation (after deducting half a Euro) was sufficient.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned as a factor in the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of expected values and the impact of negative outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50% for 0 Euros). The individual also chose Lottery B, but the justification provided does not explicitly mention the comparison of maximum probabilities as the reason for the choice. Instead, the focus was on avoiding dramatic negative consequences and the sufficiency of the compensation.

Given these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (Lottery B), the justification provided does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule (comparing maximum probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not show a direct consideration of the maximum probability of each lottery as the basis for the decision. However, it is not a 0 because the choice made (Lottery B) happens to align with what the decision reason would suggest, even if for different stated reasons."

- Lottery B: 99.9% chance of €0 and 0.1% chance of €5000.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries and calculated the expected values.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification is based on the calculation of expected values, which turned out to be equal for both lotteries. However, the individual decided to choose Lottery B because the potential gain of €5000, despite its low probability, could have a significant impact on their life, implying that the €5 from Lottery A would have a negligible effect.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process as a key factor. The individual considered probabilities but in the context of expected values and the potential impact of the outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (99.9% for €0) over Lottery A (100% for €5). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the potential significant gain and not the comparison of maximum probabilities.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the focus was on expected values and the potential life impact of the outcomes rather than the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a loss of 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for a loss of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 100%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 99.9%
Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, this information is directly relevant.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries, calculated the expected values for both lotteries, and noted that these expected values are equal. The individual also considered the aspect of avoiding a highly negative consequence (the -5000 Euros outcome in Lottery B).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by mentioning the willingness to pay 5 Euros to avoid the small probability of an extremely negative consequence, implying a risk-averse behavior.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason requires the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. While the individual did consider probabilities, the focus as described in the verbal report was more on the avoidance of negative outcomes and the calculation of expected values rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B was based on avoiding a highly negative outcome, not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. The individual's reasoning was more aligned with risk aversion than with the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual as the primary basis for their choice. The individual's justification focuses on risk aversion and expected values rather than the direct comparison of maximum probabilities as specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome of 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability = 100%
- Lottery B: Maximum probability = 50%
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries and calculated the expected value of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose the lottery based on the higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities but focused on calculating the expected value, not directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, whereas the individual chose based on the higher expected value. These are different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on expected values rather than comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries and then calculated the expected value of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and expected values): The individual considered more information than just the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (chose based on the higher expected value): The decision reason and the individual’s justification are based on different criteria.

Given these comparisons, the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its lower maximum probability (50% vs. 100%). However, the individual's justification is based on the expected value, not the maximum probability, indicating a different decision-making process.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100% for the outcome of 1000 Euros, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50% for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities for both lotteries and calculated the expected value of each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the lottery with the higher expected value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual considered the expected value, which is a different aspect of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower maximum probability, whereas the individual chose the lottery with the higher expected value. These two rules are not the same.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as they considered different information (expected value vs. maximum probability) and applied a different rule (higher expected value vs. lower maximum probability).

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered the outcomes and their respective probabilities for both lotteries, as well as calculating the expected values. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the avoidance of risk, specifically the risk of gaining a debt of 6000 Euros, and the fact that they are satisfied with their current financial situation and do not want to risk changing it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, probabilities, and expected values) shows that the individual did consider the probabilities but focused more on the risk aspect and personal financial satisfaction rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower maximum probability) to the individual's justification (avoiding risk and being satisfied with the current financial situation) indicates that the individual's decision was not based on the maximum probability rule but on risk aversion and personal financial satisfaction.
