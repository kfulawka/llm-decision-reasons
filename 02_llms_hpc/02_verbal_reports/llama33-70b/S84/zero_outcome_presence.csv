STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, Lottery A has a 1% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, while Lottery B has no zero outcome. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the presence of a zero outcome in Lottery A and its absence in Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual calculated the expected gain for both options, indicating they considered the monetary outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because it was ""leicht besser"" (slightly better), implying the decision was based on a comparison of the expected outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected gain). The individual's consideration does not explicitly mention the presence of a zero outcome as a factor.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing the slightly better option based on expected gain). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there is no indication that the presence of a zero outcome in Lottery A was the reason for its preference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a decision based on the comparison of expected gains, not on the presence of a zero outcome. This suggests that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence of the zero outcome in both lotteries. Since both lotteries have a zero outcome, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries, as it does not provide a basis for distinguishing between them.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual first looked at both options and then focused on calculating the expected gain, finding it complicated. They re-examined the probabilities and outcomes multiple times and calculated the median expected gain in their head. The individual concluded that Option 2 (which corresponds to Lottery B) is slightly better than Option 1 (which corresponds to Lottery A). The justification for the choice is based on the comparison of the expected gains of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome in both lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, outcomes, and expected gain), it's clear that the individual did not focus on the presence of the zero outcome as the primary factor for their decision. Instead, they considered the expected gain. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (comparing expected gains). The individual's process and justification do not indicate that the presence of a zero outcome was a decisive factor in their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. For Lottery A, there is no zero outcome since it offers 3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, there is a 20% probability of a zero outcome (0 Euros) and an 80% probability of 4000 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason is the presence of a zero outcome in Lottery B and its absence in Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk-free nature of one option (Option 1, which refers to Lottery A) and the risk associated with the other (Option 2, referring to Lottery B), including the possibility of not winning with the latter.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 1 because it offers a risk-free gain, whereas Option 2 not only has a lower expected gain but also carries the risk of not gaining anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, which is present in Lottery B. However, the individual's consideration was more about the risk-free aspect of Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B, not specifically preferring Lottery B for having a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome (Lottery B), but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on its risk-free nature and higher guaranteed outcome, not because it lacked a zero outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision. The decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual's reasoning was centered around avoiding risk and ensuring a gain, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not reflect the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In this case, both lotteries (A and B) have a zero outcome. The relevant information for this reason is the presence of the zero outcome in both lotteries, which is indeed derivable from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. However, the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a zero outcome is ambiguous since both lotteries have this outcome. We will proceed to understand how the individual made their decision.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected gain (erwartbaren Gewinn) of both options, indicating they looked at the potential outcomes and their probabilities to calculate an average or expected value for each lottery.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a slightly higher expected gain compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome in each lottery) with that considered by the individual (expected gain of both options), we see that the individual focused on the expected monetary outcomes rather than the presence of a zero outcome as a decisive factor.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher expected gain), it's clear that the individual's decision was based on the expected value calculation, not on the presence of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, both lotteries (A and B) have a zero outcome. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The relevant information is that both lotteries have a zero outcome with different probabilities (55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared both options, focusing on the calculation of the expected gain, which they found to be equal for both lotteries. They also considered risk minimization.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B (referred to as ""Option 2"") due to reasons of risk minimization, as they found both lotteries to have equal expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, but the individual's consideration was more about the expected gain and risk minimization, not directly about the presence of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual's choice was based on minimizing risk, which aligns with choosing the lottery with a lower probability of the zero outcome (Lottery B), not because it has a zero outcome but because it has a higher chance of a positive outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prefers a lottery based solely on the presence of a zero outcome, which is not the criteria the individual used for their choice. The individual focused on expected gain and risk minimization, leading to the selection of Lottery B due to its higher probability of a positive outcome, not because of the presence of a zero outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, both lotteries (A and B) have a zero outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a zero outcome with high probabilities (99.9% for Lottery B and 99.8% for Lottery A). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected gain of both options and found them to be equal. They also considered the risk associated with each option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the ""geringeren Risikos"" (lower risk), indicating a preference for a more conservative choice with a lower potential gain but also lower risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, which is present in both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the expected gain and the risk associated with each option rather than the presence of a zero outcome itself.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual's justification was based on choosing the option with lower risk, not explicitly because it had a zero outcome. The individual's choice seems to be driven by risk aversion rather than the specific presence of a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The decision reason provided does not align with the individual's justification for their choice as described in the verbal report. The individual's decision was based on expected gain and risk aversion, not on the presence of a zero outcome in the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, Lottery A has a 20% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, while Lottery B has no zero outcome since it offers -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the presence or absence of a zero outcome in each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected loss for both options, indicating they considered the monetary outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 2 (Lottery B) because it had a better (lower) expected loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, but the individual considered expected losses, not specifically the presence of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual preferred the lottery with the lower expected loss, which does not directly relate to the presence of a zero outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly consider the presence of a zero outcome as the basis for their decision but rather focused on the expected loss. The decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, which does not align with the individual's justification based on expected loss.

The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. Both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome with different probabilities (80% for A and 75% for B). Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is the presence of a zero outcome in both lotteries and their respective probabilities.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 2 (Lottery B) because it has a lower expected loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, but the individual considered the expected loss, which is calculated based on all outcomes and their probabilities, not just the presence of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual preferred the lottery with the lower expected loss, not directly because of the zero outcome.

The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a zero outcome with different probabilities (55% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected outcomes of both lotteries and calculated the middle expected result, concluding that both options would be equal in the long run. However, the individual also considered the risk associated with each option for a single trial.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the less risky option to avoid losing too much at once, which led to choosing the option perceived as less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, which is present in both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the risk associated with each option rather than the mere presence of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, but it does not specify how to choose when both lotteries have a zero outcome. The individual's justification was based on risk aversion for a single trial, not directly on the presence of a zero outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as stated. The decision reason's focus on the presence of a zero outcome does not align with the individual's risk-based justification.

The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, Lottery B has a 50% probability of a 0 Euro outcome, while Lottery A has no zero outcome (it has a 100% probability of a -500 Euro outcome). Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is: Lottery B has a zero outcome and Lottery A does not.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected gain/loss of both options and the risk associated with each option, noting that one option is riskier due to the possibility of a larger loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option that is less risky because it guarantees a small, certain loss over the possibility of a larger loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In the given decision problem, both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome. For Lottery A, there is a 75% probability of winning 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, there is a 50% probability of winning 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have a zero outcome, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for this reason is the presence and probability of the zero outcome in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual calculated the expected gains of both options and considered them equivalent. This suggests the individual looked at the monetary outcomes and their probabilities to some extent.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B (referred to as ""Option 2"") because it offers a ""sichereren und niedrigeren Gewinn,"" which translates to a ""safer and lower gain."" This implies the individual preferred Lottery B for its more secure, albeit lower, payoff structure compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence and probability of zero outcomes) with that considered by the individual (expected gains and the concept of a ""safer"" option), it seems the individual did not directly focus on the presence of zero outcomes as the primary decision criterion. Instead, the individual's focus was more on the expected value and the perceived safety of the options.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the safer, lower gain option), there is a discrepancy. The decision reason would suggest preferring the lottery based solely on the presence of a zero outcome, which does not align with the individual's reasoning about safety and expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on expected gains and the preference for a ""safer"" option do not indicate that the presence of a zero outcome was the decisive factor.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. Both Lottery A and Lottery B have a zero outcome, so the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery B has a 75% chance of a zero outcome.
- Lottery A has a 50% chance of a zero outcome.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the calculation of the expected gain/loss of both options.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option with the lower expected loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence and probability of zero outcomes, but the individual considered expected gains/losses, not directly the presence or probability of zero outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome based on its presence, but the individual's justification is based on the calculation of expected loss, not the presence of a zero outcome.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. For Lottery A, there is a 99.9% chance of a 0 Euro outcome, and for Lottery B, there is no zero outcome since it offers a guaranteed 5 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a zero outcome in each lottery's possible outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes calculating the expected monetary gain of both options and evaluating their risk. The individual mentions that both options are equivalent in terms of expected gain but focuses on the risk aspect for the final decision.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B (Option 2) is that it is more conservative and less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected gain and risk), it appears the individual did consider aspects related to the outcomes but not specifically the presence of a zero outcome as a primary factor.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) to the individual's justification (choosing the less risky option with a guaranteed gain), it seems the individual's decision was based on risk aversion rather than the specific presence of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because the information relevant to the reason (presence of a zero outcome) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Lottery B has a zero outcome with 99.9% probability, and Lottery A has no zero outcome but a constant negative outcome of -5 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B contains a zero outcome, while Lottery A does not.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considered the expected loss of both options and found them to be equivalent in this regard. The individual chose Option 1 (which, based on the context, appears to refer to Lottery A, the one with a constant loss of -5 Euros) because it was considered to be more conservative or less risky.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome) with that considered by the individual (expected loss and risk), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the presence of a zero outcome as a deciding factor. Instead, the focus was on the expected loss and the perceived risk. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (choosing the option because it was seen as less risky in terms of expected loss).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Option 2 (Lottery B) to be clearly better, implying they preferred the certain gain of 1500 Euros over the uncertain outcomes of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected gains, not the presence of zero outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers a lottery with a zero outcome, but since neither lottery has a zero outcome, and the individual preferred the certain gain (Lottery B) without mentioning zero outcomes, it suggests the individual did not use this specific decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. In this case, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B explicitly offers a zero outcome, but we can derive that Lottery B has an expected value of 0 (since 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability average out to 0), and Lottery A offers a certain gain of 2000 Euros. However, the reason specifically looks for a lottery with a zero outcome, not an expected value of zero. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason is the presence or absence of a zero outcome in the lotteries' outcomes. In this case, neither lottery directly offers a zero outcome, but the reasoning might be applied in a broader sense considering expected values or the concept of ""no gain"" in the context of expected outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Option 1 (which we can infer is Lottery A, given the description of a ""sicheren Gewinn"" or certain gain) offers a certain gain, while Option 2 (Lottery B) ""im Mittel keinen Gewinn bietet"" (on average offers no gain). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of gain versus the average or expected outcome, without explicitly mentioning the presence or absence of a zero outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about preferring a lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual discusses the certainty of gain and the average outcome, not directly mentioning zero outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the certainty of gain and the concept of average gain, which does not directly align with the rule of preferring a lottery because it has a zero outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the certainty of gain and the average outcome rather than the presence of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. However, in the given lotteries, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B explicitly offers a zero outcome. Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability, while Lottery B offers 1000 Euros with 100% probability. Since neither lottery has a zero outcome, the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a zero outcome) cannot be directly derived from the lotteries as described. The decision reason, as stated, does not apply directly because it specifically looks for a lottery with a zero outcome, which is not present in either option.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered both options and noted the presence of a ""kleinen sicheren Gewinn"" (small certain gain) in Option 2 (Lottery B), implying they recognized the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B. They also mentioned that in Option 1 (Lottery A), ""im Mittel gar kein Gewinn"" (on average, no gain), indicating an understanding of the expected value of Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Option 2 because it offers a ""kleinen sicheren Gewinn,"" suggesting their decision was based on the certainty and positivity of the outcome in Lottery B, as opposed to the uncertainty and potential for no average gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about preferring a lottery with a zero outcome, but the individual's consideration was about the certainty of gain and the average outcome, not specifically about the presence of a zero outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring a lottery with a zero outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a certain, positive gain). The individual's focus was on the certainty and positivity of the gain, not the presence of a zero outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make their decision. The decision reason specifically looks for a zero outcome, which was not a factor in the individual's justification.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a zero outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery with a zero outcome. Given the lotteries, we can derive the relevant information: Lottery A has a 0 Euro outcome with 100% probability, and Lottery B has outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, each with 50% probability, but no zero outcome. Thus, the decision reason can be applied, preferring Lottery A due to its zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk associated with each option, noting that Option 1 (Lottery A) offers no risk with a zero gain, while Option 2 (Lottery B) offers a risk of loss as well as a potential gain, with no overall expected gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option 1 due to reasons of risk minimization, noting that while Option 2 has an equal chance of loss or gain, it effectively offers no average gain, similar to Option 1, but with risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a zero outcome, which is directly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor (Option 1 offering ""keinerlei Risiko, bei Null Gewinn"" - no risk, with zero gain).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a zero outcome, and the individual chose the lottery with a zero outcome (Option 1) but justified it based on risk minimization rather than explicitly stating a preference for the zero outcome itself.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's decision aligns with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring the lottery with a zero outcome), but the justification provided in the verbal report focuses on risk minimization rather than an explicit preference for the lottery with a zero outcome. This suggests that while the decision reason could have influenced the choice, it is uncertain whether it was the specific reason used by the individual to make the decision."
