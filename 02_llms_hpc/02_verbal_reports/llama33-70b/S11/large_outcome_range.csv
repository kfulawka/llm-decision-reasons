STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A (100% chance of 2400 Euros) and the uncertainty in Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 1% chance of winning 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the security of a fixed gain, comparing it to the potential of winning nothing in Lottery B. They also noted that the gains in the other outcomes of Lottery B were similar to or the same as the gain in Lottery A, but this did not outweigh the appeal of the certain gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual focused more on the certainty of the gain and the risk of winning nothing, rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the security of a fixed gain over the potential risks and rewards of Lottery B, not the difference between the outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason does not align with the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A.

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for this reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the percentage chance of achieving a high outcome in each lottery. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was that it had a higher percentage chance of achieving a high outcome compared to Lottery B. The described deliberation process focuses on the probability of achieving a high outcome, not directly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (the percentage chance of achieving a high outcome), there is a mismatch. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning, not on the difference between the outcomes. Additionally, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with a higher probability of a high outcome), it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery B due to its larger difference between outcomes (2500 Euros vs. 2400 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of winning with Lottery B, stating there's only a ""70% Chance auf Gewinn"" (70% chance of winning), which seems to be an error since the actual probability of winning 4000 Euros in Lottery B is 80%. The individual chose Lottery A because of this perceived lower chance of winning with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is based on the perceived probability of winning, not on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the perceived probability of winning), it's clear that the individual did not consider the difference in outcomes as stated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the perceived probability of winning), it's evident that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of earning 3000 Euros, comparing it between Lottery A and Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of earning 3000 Euros was higher in Lottery A than in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probability of earning a specific amount, not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (4000 Euros difference) over Lottery A (3000 Euros difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of earning 3000 Euros, not the difference between outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, as their justification is based on probability rather than outcome differences.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both Lotteries A and B, specifically mentioning the 90% chance of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the 45% chance of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose Lottery A because the chance of winning (45%) was lower in Lottery B, implying that the higher probability of a positive outcome in Lottery A was the basis for their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probabilities rather than the outcome differences. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (6000 Euros difference). However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the higher probability of winning, not the difference in outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, the preferred lottery would be A because it has a larger difference (6000 Euros) between its minimum and maximum outcomes compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B had a higher probability of winning (0.2%) compared to Lottery A (0.1%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher probability of winning compared to Lottery A, despite the potential higher payout of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher probability of winning, not the outcome differences.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A has two possible outcomes, while Lottery B has only one outcome. They also considered the probability of not losing money in Lottery A (20% chance of getting 0 Euros) and the certainty of losing money in Lottery B (100% chance of losing 3000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a chance (20%) to not lose money, unlike Lottery B where a loss was certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the presence of two outcomes in Lottery A, the certainty of loss in Lottery B, and the chance to avoid loss in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification was based on the avoidance of certain loss and the presence of a chance to not lose money, not explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the certainty of loss in one option and the chance to avoid loss in the other, rather than on the range of outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Since 4000 Euros (difference for Lottery A) is greater than 3000 Euros (difference for Lottery B), according to the decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred based on this rule.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of landing on 0 Euros for each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the higher probability of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual considered the probability of landing on 0 Euros. These are different aspects of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing (based on the verbal report) does not mention the difference between outcomes but rather the probability of landing on 0 Euros, which actually suggests a preference for Lottery A because it has a higher probability of landing on 0 Euros, but this is not the reasoning provided by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, which focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The verbal report indicates the decision was based on the probability of landing on 0 Euros, not the difference between outcomes.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a difference of 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A has a 100% chance of losing 500 Euros and that Lottery B has a 50% chance of winning or losing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a 50:50 chance of winning or losing, implying a potential for a positive outcome (winning) that is not present in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more about the presence of a chance to win or lose in Lottery B, rather than the specific differences between outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the presence of a 50:50 chance, not explicitly on the differences between the outcomes. 

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on outcome differences, suggesting that the individual did not explicitly use this reason for their decision. However, the choice of Lottery B could coincidentally align with what the decision reason would suggest, given that Lottery B has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, was based on avoiding a guaranteed loss, not explicitly on the range of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The verbal report suggests the decision was influenced more by the desire to avoid a certain loss than by comparing the ranges of possible outcomes in the lotteries. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 1500 Euros (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros in Lottery B and mistakenly believed there was a 50:50 chance involved with Lottery B, which is actually a characteristic of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the 100% guarantee of winning 1500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which the individual does not explicitly mention in their justification.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (6000 Euros difference) over Lottery B (0 Euros difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its guarantee, not the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification focuses on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning 2000 Euros in Lottery A and the 50:50 chance of winning either 3000 Euros or -3000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of its certain outcome compared to the risky outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor considered by the individual.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on its certainty, not the difference between outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome for Lottery B (100% chance of winning 1000 Euros) and the uncertainty of Lottery A (50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the win was certain (100% probability), implying they preferred the certainty of the outcome over the gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome for B and uncertainty for A), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring certainty over a gamble), it is clear that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual preferred the lottery with the smaller difference (Lottery B) due to its certainty, not because of the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros with 100% probability, meaning both the maximum and minimum outcomes are 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss (getting into the negative) associated with Lottery A, specifically mentioning a 50:50 chance of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B to avoid going into debt, citing the 50:50 chance of loss with Lottery A as the reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual focused on avoiding loss due to the 50:50 chance of a negative outcome in Lottery A. The individual's consideration does not directly address the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B to avoid loss, indicating their justification is based on risk aversion rather than the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its larger difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a desire to avoid potential loss, not on the basis of the difference between the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
