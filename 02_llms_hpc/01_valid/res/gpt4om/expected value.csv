expected value
"STEPS: 
1. Calculate the expected value of Lottery A:
   - The expected value (EV) of Lottery A is calculated as follows:
   EV(A) = (2500 Euros * 0.33) + (2400 Euros * 0.66) + (0 Euros * 0.01) 
   = 825 Euros + 1584 Euros + 0 Euros 
   = 2409 Euros

2. Calculate the expected value of Lottery B:
   - The expected value (EV) of Lottery B is straightforward since it has a 100% probability of offering 2400 Euros. Thus:
   EV(B) = 2400 Euros * 1.00
   = 2400 Euros

3. Compare the expected values:
   - EV(A) = 2409 Euros
   - EV(B) = 2400 Euros
   Since EV(A) is greater than EV(B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A over Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Calculate the expected value of Lottery A: 
   - EV(A) = (2500 Euros * 0.33) + (0 Euros * 0.67) 
   - EV(A) = 825 Euros + 0 Euros 
   - EV(A) = 825 Euros.

2. Calculate the expected value of Lottery B: 
   - EV(B) = (2400 Euros * 0.34) + (0 Euros * 0.66) 
   - EV(B) = 816 Euros + 0 Euros 
   - EV(B) = 816 Euros.

3. Compare the expected values: 
   - EV(A) = 825 Euros 
   - EV(B) = 816 Euros
   
   Since 825 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 816 Euros (Lottery B), according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred due to its higher expected value.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Calculate the expected value of Lottery A:
   - Expected value (EV) of Lottery A = (4000 Euros * 0.80) + (0 Euros * 0.20) 
   - EV of Lottery A = 3200 Euros + 0 Euros = 3200 Euros.

2. Calculate the expected value of Lottery B:
   - Expected value (EV) of Lottery B = (3000 Euros * 1.00) 
   - EV of Lottery B = 3000 Euros.

3. Compare the expected values: 
   - EV of Lottery A = 3200 Euros.
   - EV of Lottery B = 3000 Euros. 
   - Since 3200 Euros > 3000 Euros, Lottery A has the higher expected value.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Identify the relevant information to calculate the expected value of each lottery.
For Lottery A:
- Outcome of 4000 Euros with a 20% probability
- Outcome of 0 Euros with an 80% probability
Expected value for Lottery A = (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros

For Lottery B:
- Outcome of 3000 Euros with a 25% probability
- Outcome of 0 Euros with a 75% probability
Expected value for Lottery B = (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros

Since we can derive expected values from the lotteries, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason by comparing the expected values.
- Expected value of Lottery A = 800 Euros
- Expected value of Lottery B = 750 Euros

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which is Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the expected value of each lottery. 
- For Lottery A: 
  Expected Value (EV_A) = (6000 Euros * 0.45) + (0 Euros * 0.55) = 2700 Euros.
- For Lottery B: 
  Expected Value (EV_B) = (3000 Euros * 0.90) + (0 Euros * 0.10) = 2700 Euros.

Since both lotteries A and B have the same expected value of 2700 Euros, we can conclude that the decision reason applies to the decision problem in a strict manner.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. 
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. However, both lotteries A and B have the same expected value. Thus, the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries.

1. First, calculate the expected value of Lottery A:
   - Expected value of A = (Probability of -4000 Euros * Amount) + (Probability of 0 Euros * Amount) 
   - Expected value of A = (0.80 * -4000) + (0.20 * 0) 
   - Expected value of A = -3200 Euros.

2. Next, calculate the expected value of Lottery B:
   - Expected value of B = Probability of -3000 Euros * Amount 
   - Expected value of B = 1 * -3000 
   - Expected value of B = -3000 Euros.

3. Compare the expected values of both lotteries:
   - Expected value of A = -3200 Euros.
   - Expected value of B = -3000 Euros.

4. Since -3000 Euros (expected value of B) is greater than -3200 Euros (expected value of A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.
