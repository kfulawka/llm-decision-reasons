STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it has a guaranteed gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, but the individual focused on the guaranteed gain of Lottery B, not comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, but the individual's justification was based on the guarantee of the gain, not the sum of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the sum of all outcomes of each lottery to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the guarantee of the gain rather than the sum of the outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2400 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros, which does not contribute to the sum). For Lottery B, the sum is 2500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these sums: 2400 Euros for Lottery A and 2500 Euros for Lottery B. Since Lottery B has a higher outcome sum, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the probabilities of winning nothing (which is 1 percentage point lower for Lottery B) and the potential gain being 100 Euros higher for Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify the choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of not winning and the difference in potential winnings between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes of each lottery, independent of probabilities. The individual, however, considers the difference in probabilities of not winning and the difference in potential winnings, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, which would be Lottery B. The individual’s justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing the sums of outcomes but rather focuses on the probability and the potential gain difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The focus on probability differences and potential gain differences in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 Euros + 0 Euros = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived, we can apply this reason to the decision problem. The relevant information is that Lottery A has a higher outcome sum (4000 Euros) than Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate the information considered by the individual. The report mentions comparing the guaranteed win at B with the possible win at A, considering the probabilities (""4 von 5"" suggests an understanding of the 80% chance of winning in Lottery A). 
Second, we evaluate the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify choosing B despite its lower guaranteed win compared to the possible win in A, indicating a consideration of the certainty of the outcome in B over the potential but uncertain outcome in A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual, it seems the individual focused more on the comparison of the guaranteed outcome of B with the probabilistic outcome of A rather than the sum of all possible outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the guarantee of B over the potential of A), it appears the individual did not follow the decision reason’s rule since they chose B, which has a lower outcome sum.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The verbal report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos"" which translates to ""consideration of all information"" but does not specify what information was considered or how it was evaluated. It also mentions ""Zufallsauswahl"" which translates to ""random selection"" and states that both lotteries are ""ziemlich ähnlich"" which means ""quite similar"". 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries, instead, it suggests a random selection due to the similarity of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of outcomes for each lottery, but the verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the sum of the outcomes or compared them.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's report suggests a random selection due to the perceived similarity of the lotteries, without mentioning the outcome sums.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the sum of the outcomes of each lottery or used this information to make a decision. Instead, it suggests a random selection based on the perceived similarity of the lotteries, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, I am certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery A because 6000 Euros > 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the size of the gain (Gewinn) and the probability (Wahrscheinlichkeit) of winning in Lottery B, comparing it to Lottery A. They note that the gain in B is half as large but the probability is twice as high.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chooses Lottery B because, despite the gain being half as large, the probability is twice as high, and since the game is played only once, these factors influence their decision towards choosing B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (gain size and probability). The individual does not mention considering the sum of all outcomes of each lottery as part of their deliberation.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the trade-off between gain size and probability). The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule, as they prioritize the probability and the relative comparison of outcomes rather than the absolute sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of probabilities, while the individual's justification emphasizes the comparison of gain sizes and probabilities between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros (since 6000 + 0 = 6000). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros (since 3000 + 0 = 3000). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum (6000 Euros vs 3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both cases (1 in 1000 vs 2 in 1000) and the potential for a double gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the possibility of a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn,"" which translates to ""possibly double as high a gain,"" implying they chose based on the potential higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of the outcomes, while the individual considered both the probabilities and the potential for a higher gain. However, the key factor mentioned by the individual is the possibility of a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn,"" which aligns with comparing the outcomes (6000 Euros being twice 3000 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, and the individual's justification hints at choosing the lottery with the potential for a higher payout, which aligns with preferring the higher outcome sum.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment indicates a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the focus on the higher potential payout, which directly relates to the sum of the outcomes. However, it's not a perfect match since the individual also considered the probabilities, which the decision reason does not. Nonetheless, the primary justification provided by the individual aligns closely with the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. Since the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived, we can proceed.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything with Lottery A (20% chance of 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because there is at least a chance (1 in 5, which is actually 1 in 5 or 20%) to not lose anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (-4000 for A, -3000 for B), while the individual focused on the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A, not explicitly considering the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B since -3000 is greater than -4000), but the individual chose Lottery A based on the chance to avoid loss, not the sum of outcomes.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 + 0 = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (-3000 is greater than -4000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the loss associated with each lottery and its probability, as indicated by ""der Verlust geringer ist (wenn auch etwas wahrscheinlicher)"" which translates to ""the loss is smaller (even if a bit more probable)"".
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, even though it's slightly more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, whereas the individual considered the size of the loss and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B because -3000 is ""greater"" than -4000 in this context. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on the justification that the loss is smaller and slightly more probable, not explicitly mentioning the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the smaller loss and its probability, not the sum of the outcomes as the decision reason suggests. This indicates that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery based solely on the sum of outcomes, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros + 0 Euros = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros + 0 Euros = -6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the sums of the outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and the possibility of winning 0 Euros for both lotteries, noting that the possible loss is higher for Lottery B but the possibility of winning 0 Euros is higher for Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher possible loss, the possibility of winning 0 Euros (or not losing) is higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities and specific outcomes rather than the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A since -3000 Euros is greater than -6000 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of not losing (getting 0 Euros) and the magnitude of the loss, not the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the sum of its outcomes. The individual considered probabilities and the magnitude of losses rather than the sum of the outcomes, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -6000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome, but it does not contribute to the sum as it is 0). For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount and the risk (probability of the loss) of each lottery. They noted that the loss in Lottery B is half that of Lottery A but comes with double the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is only half as high as in Lottery A, despite the risk being double.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes, whereas the individual considered both the loss amount and the risk (probability of the loss). 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which aligns with preferring the lesser loss in absolute terms. However, the individual's justification also takes into account the doubling of risk, which is not a factor in the decision reason. The decision reason does not account for the probability of the outcomes, only their sum.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process involved considerations (risk) not included in the decision reason, but the preference for the lesser loss amount aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher outcome sum.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's outcome (preferring the lottery with the lesser loss), the deliberation process described in the verbal report involves factors (such as risk) not considered by the decision reason, suggesting that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability, so its sum is simply 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros, so its sum is 1000 + 0 = 1000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an outcome sum of 500 Euros and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos,"" which translates to ""consideration of all information."" This implies the individual looked at all aspects of both lotteries, though it doesn't specify which aspects were considered.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report states ""Entscheidung für A bei garantiertem Gewinn,"" which translates to ""decision for A with guaranteed win."" This suggests the individual's justification was based on the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, but the individual's consideration seems to be more about the guarantee of the win rather than the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery A based on its guaranteed win, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the sum of all outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery B, but the individual chose Lottery A based on its guaranteed outcome, not considering the sum of outcomes as the decision reason would. This discrepancy indicates the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -1000 Euros + 0 Euros = -1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -500 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated and compared, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: -1000 Euros for Lottery A and -500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, there is at least a chance to lose nothing (""Ansehen aller Infos bei A besteht wenigstens eine Chance nichts zu verlieren""). This indicates the individual considered the possibility of not losing any money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but highlights the consideration of the chance to not lose anything with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A. These are different focuses; the individual's consideration does not directly align with calculating and comparing the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case since -500 Euros is greater than -1000 Euros. However, the individual's justification, as far as provided, emphasizes the chance of not losing with Lottery A, not the comparison of outcome sums.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the chance to not lose anything with Lottery A and the lack of mention of comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries suggest that the decision reason, which specifically considers the sum of all outcomes independent of probabilities, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 2000 + 0 = 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The sums of the outcomes for both lotteries are equal, indicating that according to this reason, the individual should be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos"" which translates to ""consideration of all information,"" but it specifically highlights the ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) as the reason for choosing Lottery B. This implies the individual considered the probabilities of winning in their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because they believed the winning probability was higher. This justification is based on the probability of getting any positive outcome, which is not explicitly stated but implied by the choice.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of the outcomes of the lotteries, whereas the individual considered the winning probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, which would lead to indifference in this case since both lotteries have the same sum. However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived higher winning probability of Lottery B, not the sum of the outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating the sum of all outcomes of each lottery to make their decision. Instead, they focused on the probabilities of winning.

For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + (-2000) + 0 = -6000 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the possible loss and its probability, focusing on the fact that the possible loss in Lottery A is smaller, even though the loss is more probable. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (possible loss and its probability). The individual did not explicitly mention considering the sum of all outcomes of each lottery.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller). The decision reason would lead to indifference between the lotteries since they have the same outcome sum, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (the size of the possible loss).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability, so the sum is simply 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the sum is 5000 + 0 = 5000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: 5 Euros for Lottery A and 5000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win at Lottery A, which is low but guaranteed, and the chance of winning a higher amount at Lottery B, which is 1 in 1000.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win is guaranteed, even though it's low, over the low chance of a higher win at Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes (5 Euros for A, 5000 Euros for B), but the individual's consideration is about the guarantee of the win and the comparative probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (which would be Lottery B), but the individual preferred Lottery A because of its guarantee, not because of the sum of its outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is -5000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but does not change the sum). For Lottery A, the sum is -5 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential loss of Lottery B but also its low probability, comparing it to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high loss, although significant, is very unlikely compared to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes (-5000 Euros for B and -5 Euros for A), which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of probabilities and the comparative likelihoods of losses.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A since -5 Euros is greater than -5000 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of the loss and the comparative guarantee of a lower loss in Lottery A, not the sum of outcomes.

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based solely on the sum of outcomes without considering probabilities, whereas the individual's justification explicitly mentions the probability and comparative guaranteed loss, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 1500 Euros. Since the sums can be calculated from the given outcomes, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery B and 1500 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, the gain is guaranteed (""der Gewinn garantiert ist"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the gain is guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed gain of Lottery A). The individual's consideration does not directly match the calculation of the sum of outcomes for each lottery as required by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (guaranteed gain). The individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of the gain rather than comparing the sum of outcomes between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason (comparing the sum of all outcomes of each lottery) to make the decision. Instead, the decision was based on the guarantee of a positive outcome in Lottery A.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the sum is 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and the guaranteed win (""garantiertem Gewinn"") of Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided in favor of Lottery A because of the guaranteed win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the sum of outcomes of each lottery, but the individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is based on the guaranteed win, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the guaranteed win, which does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the sum of outcomes of each lottery, which is the key factor in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain, while Lottery A has a possible loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the guaranteed gain of Lottery B and the possibility of loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the guaranteed gain of one lottery and the risk of loss in the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the guarantee and risk, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason is based on the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, but the verbal report does not mention this calculation or consideration. Instead, the individual's decision is based on the guarantee of gain and the possibility of loss, which aligns with a different decision-making criterion, such as risk aversion, rather than the sum of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + (-6000 Euros) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. This information is: Lottery A has an outcome sum of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has an outcome sum of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and the possibility of a win with Lottery A (""Gewinn möglich"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because a win is possible (""darum A""), implying the potential for a positive outcome was a factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual considered the possibility of a win, which indirectly relates to the outcomes but does not explicitly mention summing the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but since both lotteries have the same outcome sum (0 Euros), it would be indifferent. The individual's justification is based on the possibility of a win, not the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, as they did not mention summing outcomes or comparing these sums between the two lotteries. Their justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the possibility of winning, not the total sum of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
