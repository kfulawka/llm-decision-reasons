STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 100% - 100% = 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in probability ranges for each lottery, which are 65% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery A, the 1% chance of winning nothing, the high or secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries, and the 33% chance of an additional €100 gain in Lottery A. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning its slightly higher expected value, the compensation of the 1% risk of winning nothing by the potential for an additional €100 gain, and the secure probabilities of winning in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (expected value, specific probabilities, and potential gains). The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on expected value, risk compensation, and potential gains). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as it does not mention the comparison of probability differences between the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not appear to be based on the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are 34% for Lottery A and 32% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same, and observed that both winnings and probabilities are very similar. They also considered the difference between the possible winnings and the slight increase in winning probability offered by Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B because it offers a slightly increased winning probability, given that the difference between the possible winnings is not very high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the similarity in probabilities and the slight increase in winning probability for Lottery B but did not discuss the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (34% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its slightly increased winning probability, not the difference between the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not considered by the individual. Instead, the individual's choice is based on the similarity of the lotteries and the slight increase in winning probability offered by Lottery B. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: difference = 0% (100% - 100%)
- Lottery B: difference = 60% (80% - 20%)
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the expected value of each lottery and noted that Lottery B has a slightly higher expected value than Lottery A. Additionally, they considered the certainty of the outcome for Lottery A versus the chance of a higher gain with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, whereas Lottery B only offers a chance at a slightly higher gain. The justification focuses on the certainty of the outcome rather than the difference in probability ranges.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered expected values and the certainty of outcomes, not the range of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the certainty of the gain, not the probability differences.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the outcome is 0 Euros with 75% probability) and the maximum probability is 25% (for the 3000 Euros outcome). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as the outcome is 0 Euros with 80% probability) and the maximum probability is 20% (for the 4000 Euros outcome). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 25% - 0% = 25%, and for Lottery B, it is 20% - 0% = 20%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which would be Lottery A in this case.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of Lottery B to be slightly higher, noted that the gain in Lottery A is somewhat more probable, but emphasized the significantly higher possible gain in Lottery B and the similarity in probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B due to its higher possible gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations were about expected value, probability of gain, and the magnitude of the possible gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its larger difference in probabilities (25% vs. 20%), but the individual chose Lottery B based on its higher possible gain, not the difference in probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 45% (for winning 6000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), but since we're looking at the difference in probabilities related to winning and not winning, we actually consider the probabilities associated with the outcomes. Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 45% - 0% = 45% (considering the probability of the winning outcome). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros) and the minimum probability is 10% (for winning 0 Euros), so the difference for Lottery B is 90% - 0% = 90%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are 45% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery A offers a moderate chance at a high win, and Lottery B offers a very high chance at half the amount of Lottery A's potential win.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the chance of winning is significantly higher with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (expected values and probabilities of winning), it seems the individual did consider probabilities but not specifically the differences between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing based on the higher chance of winning), the individual's justification aligns with choosing the lottery with a higher probability of the positive outcome but does not directly mention comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries. The individual's focus was more on the absolute probability of winning rather than the relative difference in probabilities within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason provided, which specifically considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's justification is based on the higher chance of winning in Lottery B, not the comparison of probability differences within each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), so the difference is 99.8% (or 0.998). For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (or 0.998), so the difference is 99.6% (or 0.996). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the probability of winning is very low for both, and Lottery A offers the chance of a twice as high gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having a very low probability of winning, Lottery A offers a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. However, the individual's consideration focused on the expected value, the low probability of winning, and the potential gain, without mentioning the difference in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A (99.8% difference vs 99.6% difference). The individual's justification, however, is based on the potential gain being higher in Lottery A, not on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's focus was on the expected value, the low probability of winning, and the higher potential gain of Lottery A, without any mention of comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (-4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (100% - 100% = 0%). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting that Lottery A has a slightly lower expected value than Lottery B. They also considered the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the chance of no loss in Lottery A, weighing the magnitude of potential losses and the probability of avoiding loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite both lotteries having losses in the same order of magnitude, Lottery A offers a decent chance of not losing anything, which outweighed the slight difference in expected values for them.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor influencing the decision. The individual discusses probabilities in terms of ""eine mittlere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf keinen Verlust"" (a moderate probability of no loss), but not in the context of comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, is based on the presence of a ""gute Chance, nichts zu verlieren"" (good chance of not losing anything) in Lottery A and the comparable magnitude of losses, not on the difference in probability ranges.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability to make their decision. The focus was more on the presence of a chance to avoid loss and the comparison of expected outcomes rather than the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% (minimum) and 75% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% (minimum) and 80% (maximum), resulting in a difference of 60%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B due to its larger difference (60% > 50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the expected value of the lotteries, the probability of loss, and the magnitude of the loss. The individual notes that Lottery A has a slightly higher expected value, both lotteries have a moderate probability of loss, and the loss in A is lower but only marginally more probable than in B.
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its higher expected value, lower loss amount, and only marginally higher probability of that loss compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (expected value, probability of loss, magnitude of loss), it's clear the individual did not directly consider the probability differences as outlined in the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B) to the individual's justification (focusing on expected value, loss amount, and its probability), it's evident the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual chose Lottery A based on different criteria.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries offer the same expected value, both have a high loss probability, but Lottery A has a higher loss probability than Lottery B. They also noted that a loss in Lottery A is very probable, while a loss in Lottery B is only half as probable, and although a potential loss in Lottery B is twice as high, the difference in probabilities is significant.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential loss, the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries (with Lottery A having a much higher probability of loss) was deemed more significant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual discussed the probabilities and their differences but framed it in terms of loss probabilities rather than the specific differences between minimum and maximum probabilities as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (80% difference) over Lottery B (10% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the significant difference in loss probabilities as their reason, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (or 0.998), with the difference being 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), with the difference being 99.9%. Since both lotteries have probabilities that allow for the calculation of this difference, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information is the probability differences for each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, the possible loss in Lottery B is twice as high as in Lottery A, and both losses have very low probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the potential loss is half of Lottery B's, despite both having low probabilities of occurring.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 1000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (for the 500 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and the decision reason prefers Lottery A due to its larger difference in probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries offer the same expected value and highlights the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B. They also consider the possibility of winning nothing in Lottery A and acknowledge the similar order of magnitude of the possible gains in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on the secure gain of 500 Euros from Lottery B because Lottery A offers the possibility of winning nothing, and despite both possible outcomes in Lottery A being of a similar order of magnitude, the security of Lottery B was preferred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in minimum and maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (expected values, secure gain, possibility of winning nothing), it appears the individual did not directly consider the specific probability differences between the lotteries' outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the secure gain because of the risk of winning nothing in the other lottery), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (for the outcome of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the outcome of -1000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries, which are equal, and the fact that Lottery A offers a certain loss of 500 Euros, while Lottery B offers a 50% chance of losing nothing. The individual also compared the losses in terms of the proportion of their assets (""in ähnlicher Größenordnung"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers the possibility of losing nothing, despite the losses being in a similar order of magnitude.

For Lottery B, the minimum probability is also 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes, since 0 Euros has a 50% probability which is higher than both) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 0 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 
For Lottery A, the difference is 25% (max) - 0% (min) = 25%.
For Lottery B, the difference is 50% (max) - 25% (min) = 25%.

The individual focuses on the expected value, the probability of loss, and the size of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to a preference for Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on the size of potential losses, not the difference in probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the expected value, loss probabilities, and loss sizes, rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, but noted that Lottery B has a very unlikely win, while Lottery A offers a small but certain win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain, albeit small, win, considering that only one round is relevant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of expected value and the certainty of the win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the certainty of the win, not the difference in probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's choice was based on the certainty of the win in Lottery A, rather than the probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the expected value of both lotteries, noting they are the same, and the nature of the losses in each lottery (a small, certain loss in Lottery B vs. a very low probability of a very high loss in Lottery A).
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the comparison of the potential losses, emphasizing the significantly higher possible loss in Lottery A and the minimal but certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (expected values and the nature of losses), it appears the individual did not directly consider the probability differences as specified by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (focusing on the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities), the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual chose Lottery B not because of the probability differences but due to the preference for a smaller, certain loss over a potentially much larger loss with a very low probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the secure gain of Lottery A, the potential for a higher gain and an equally high loss in Lottery B, and the expected value of Lottery B being lower than that of A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a secure gain and Lottery B has a lower expected value, indicating a risk-averse decision based on the certainty of the gain and the comparative expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations were about the security of the gain, the potential for loss, and the expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not apply here since both lotteries have the same difference (0%). The individual's justification, however, is based on the security of the gain and the expected value, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The verbal report focuses on the security of the gain and the expected value, indicating that the decision reason in question was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 0% difference
- Lottery B: 100% difference

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the security of the gain in Lottery B, the expected value of both lotteries, the potential higher gain in Lottery A, and the equal chance of a high loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a secure gain and a higher expected value compared to Lottery A, despite Lottery A offering a chance at a slightly higher gain, which is offset by the equal chance of a high loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the security, expected value, and potential gains and losses, but not the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the security of the gain and the expected value, not the probability differences.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected values of both lotteries (1000€ for Lottery A and 0€ for Lottery B), the possibility of a higher gain with Lottery B, and the risk of a loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning its secure gain of 1000€ and the equal probability of gain or loss with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, but the individual's consideration focused on expected values, potential gains, and losses, without explicitly discussing the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have a difference of 0%, this reason would lead to indifference. However, the individual's justification is based on the security of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery B, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's deliberation process and justification do not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The verbal report indicates that the individual's choice was based on the security of the gain and the risk associated with Lottery B, rather than the probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are summarized as: both lotteries have a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries have the same expected value, Lottery B offers a chance for a high gain but also a high loss, and Lottery A offers neither gain nor loss. They also considered the high possible loss in Lottery B and its moderate probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss in Lottery B is very high and has a moderate (mittelere Wahrscheinlichkeit, which translates to ""medium probability"" in English, but given the context, it seems the individual refers to the significant risk associated with the loss rather than literally a medium probability, since the loss has a 50% chance) probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is 0% for both. However, the individual's consideration does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries; instead, they focus on the expected value, potential gains and losses, and the associated probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the risk associated with the potential loss in Lottery B, not on the basis of comparing the probability differences between the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on the expected value, potential gains and losses, and the risk associated with these outcomes does not reflect a consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
