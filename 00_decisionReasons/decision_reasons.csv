mean outcome;The reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome.
expected value;The reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value.
outcome sensitivity;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. The differences between the outcomes of the lotteries are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome,  or if the maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome.
outcome neglect;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. The differences between the outcomes of the lotteries are considered negligible. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome.
probability neglect;The reason considers the probabilities of each lottery. The differences between the probabilities of the lotteries are considered negligible. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome.
probability sensitivity;The reason considers the probabilities of each lottery. The differences between the probabilities of the lotteries are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome.
small probability overweighting;The reason considers the small probability outcomes of each lottery. Outcomes with a probability of less than 20% receive a weight increased by 10 percentage points than their objective probability. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
loss aversion;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. Losses are considered more important than gains. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum loss.
loss avoidance;The reason considers the probabilities of losses of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the overall lower probability of loss.
reference point;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome or otherwise zero. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities.
segregation;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. The outcome with the minimum absolute value is considered a sure outcome. The differences between the sure outcome and the remaining outcomes are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of the sure outcome and the differences weighted by their probabilities.
maximum outcome expectation;The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.
minimum outcome expectation;The reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.
importance sampling;The reason considers the maximum magnitude outcome of each lottery. The maximum magnitude outcome is the outcome with the highest absolute value. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum magnitude outcome weighted by its probability.
regret;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. The sum of all pairwise differences of outcomes between the lotteries is considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable sum of outcome differences.
disappointment;The reason considers the outcomes of each lottery. The differences between maximum and minimum outcome within a lottery are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with a smaller difference between the maximum and the minimum outcomes.
left skewness;The reason considers the skewness of each lottery. A lottery is left-skewed if a greater portion of probability is assigned to favorable as opposed to unfavorable outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery that is more left-skewed.
right skewness;The reason considers the skewness of each lottery. A lottery is right-skewed if a greater portion of probability is assigned to unfavorable as opposed to favorable outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery that is more right-skewed.
outcomes better than average;The reason considers the number of outcomes higher than the average outcome. The average outcome is calculated by taking the mean of outcomes from both lotteries, without weighting by their probabilities. The reason prefers the lottery with the larger number of outcomes higher than the average outcome.
consequence count;The reason considers the comparisons of maximum and minimum outcomes between lotteries. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher number of favorable comparisons.
mean of probable outcomes;The reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery. An outcome is categorized as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.
aspiration level;The reason considers the aspiration level. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.
