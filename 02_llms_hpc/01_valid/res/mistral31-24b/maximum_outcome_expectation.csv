0,"Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**
   - The decision reason requires the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries.
   - For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
   - For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.
   - Therefore, the relevant information is:
     - Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 2500 Euros, Probability = 33%
     - Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 2400 Euros, Probability = 100%
2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.**
   - Calculate the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
     - Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 33% = 825 Euros
     - Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 100% = 2400 Euros
   - Compare the products: 825 Euros (Lottery A) < 2400 Euros (Lottery B)

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason requires the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. We can derive this information from the given lotteries:

- For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
- For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 34%.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

Calculate the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery:

- For Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 33% = 825 Euros
- For Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 34% = 816 Euros

Since 825 Euros (Lottery A) > 816 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Lottery B:
3000 Euros with 100% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.

The decision reason can be applied strictly because we can determine the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery.

- For Lottery A:
  - Maximum outcome: 4000 Euros
  - Probability of the maximum outcome: 80% (or 0.8)
  - Product: 4000 Euros * 0.8 = 3200 Euros

- For Lottery B:
  - Maximum outcome: 3000 Euros
  - Probability of the maximum outcome: 100% (or 1.0)
  - Product: 3000 Euros * 1.0 = 3000 Euros

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product of the maximum outcome and its probability.
- Product for Lottery A: 3200 Euros
- Product for Lottery B: 3000 Euros

Since 3200 Euros > 3000 Euros, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

3,"% probability
0 Euros with 75% probability

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:**
   - The decision reason requires the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. This is the maximum outcome times the probability of getting the maximum outcome.
   - For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 20%, or 0.20. The product is 4000 * 0.20 = 800.
   - For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 25%, or 0.25. The product is 3000 * 0.25 = 750.

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:**
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.
   - Comparing the products: 800 (Lottery A) vs. 750 (Lottery B).
   - Lottery A has a higher product (800 > 750).

Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason requires the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the highest non-negative outcome). For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros. The probabilities are 20% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 0 Euros, Probability = 20%
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome = -3000 Euros, Probability = 100%

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.**

Calculate the product of the maximum outcome and its probability for each lottery:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros * 20% = 0
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros * 100% = -3000
