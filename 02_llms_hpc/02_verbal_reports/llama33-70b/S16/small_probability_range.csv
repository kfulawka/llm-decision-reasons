Verbal report:
Siehe wie vorher beschrieben. Wissen ist einfach mehr.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the probability differences for each lottery: 65% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The verbal report does not explicitly mention the probabilities or the differences between them. The phrase ""Siehe wie vorher beschrieben"" translates to ""See as previously described,"" which does not provide clear information about what the individual considered. The phrase ""Wissen ist einfach mehr"" translates to ""Knowledge is simply more,"" which also does not directly relate to the probabilities or the decision reason.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not provide a clear justification for the choice between the two lotteries based on the decision reason or any other explicit criteria.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the differences in probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the verbal report does not provide a clear justification related to the decision reason or the probabilities, a direct comparison is not possible.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the decision reason was not explicitly considered by the individual, as the verbal report lacks specific references to the probabilities or their differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 34% for Lottery A and 32% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 1% difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, indicating they considered the probabilities of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to base their decision on the slight increase in probability of winning, without explicitly mentioning the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities (34% for A and 32% for B), while the individual discusses the 1% difference in winning probabilities between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 32% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the increased probability of winning, which aligns with choosing Lottery B due to its slightly higher winning probability, but does not directly address the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the slight increase in winning probability aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly discuss the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the choice made, the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a 0% difference and Lottery B has a 60% difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring to know exactly what they will get (100% certainty) rather than not knowing and possibly losing. This indicates the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the uncertainty in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification revolves around the preference for certainty over uncertainty, specifically highlighting the dislike for the risk of losing associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, while the individual's consideration is about the certainty of the outcome versus uncertainty and potential loss. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification also leads to the preference for Lottery A but is based on the desire for certainty rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. While the individual prefers Lottery A due to its certainty, the reasoning provided does not align with the decision reason's specific rule about probability differences. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities (60% for A and 50% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the probability (""von der Wahrscheinlichkeit aus""), indicating they looked at the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that Lottery B ""sah einfach besser von der Wahrscheinlichkeit aus,"" which translates to ""simply looked better in terms of probability."" This implies the individual preferred Lottery B based on its probability profile but does not specify how the probabilities were evaluated.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is a specific aspect of the probability distribution. The individual considered probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50% difference). The individual chose Lottery B, stating it looked better in terms of probability, but the justification does not explicitly match the rule of preferring the smaller difference in probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), and they mention considering probabilities. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on calculating and comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was directly used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, so the difference is 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 45% and 55%, so the difference is 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the attractiveness of the probabilities of each lottery, specifically mentioning that Lottery A's probabilities seemed more attractive and that Lottery B's probabilities were too close together.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived attractiveness of the probabilities, particularly the closeness of the probabilities in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which aligns with the individual's concern about the probabilities being ""too close together"" in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B with a 10% difference. However, the individual chose Lottery A, citing the attractiveness of its probabilities and the unattractiveness of B's close probabilities. This indicates the individual's reasoning might align with preferring a lottery based on the probability spread, but the choice does not directly follow the decision reason's rule as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates an awareness of the probability differences and a preference based on this aspect, but the choice and justification do not perfectly align with the decision reason's rule. The individual seems to value the higher probability of a positive outcome in Lottery A over the smaller probability difference in Lottery B, suggesting that while probability considerations were important, the specific decision reason provided might not have been the primary basis for the choice."
6,"0.1% mehr handelte.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 0.2% - 0% = 0.2%. For Lottery B, the difference is 0.1% - 0% = 0.1%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which is Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the probability of the lotteries. The individual mentions that the probability was ""besser angelegt"" (better laid out) for one of the lotteries, even though it was only 0.1% more. The individual's justification for the choice seems to focus on the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the comparison of probabilities), it appears that the individual considered the probabilities but did not explicitly mention the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities. However, the individual's focus on the slight difference in probabilities (0.1% more) suggests an implicit consideration of the probability differences. Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) with the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the slightly better probability), it seems that the individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason to some extent, but the explicit focus of the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability) is not clearly stated in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: difference = 0%
- Lottery B: difference = 60%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss in Lottery A and the small chance of not losing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by mentioning the existence of a small chance to not lose in Lottery B, making the attempt worthwhile.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the potential loss and the chance of not losing. The individual's considerations do not directly mention or imply comparing the range of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the presence of a small chance to not lose, not on comparing the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, also resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (50%) between its minimum and maximum probabilities compared to Lottery B (60%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions relying on the 80% probability of getting nothing, which implies they considered the probability aspect of at least one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual wanted to rely on the higher probability (80%) of not getting anything, which suggests they were focusing on the aspect of minimizing loss or avoiding the outcome of getting money, but the specific reasoning behind choosing one lottery over the other based on the probabilities is not explicitly stated in terms of comparing the two lotteries' probability ranges.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing these differences between the two lotteries. Instead, the individual focuses on the high probability of not getting anything in one of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification, as stated, does not directly align with this rule since they do not mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Für Lotterie A war mir die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu hoch zu verlieren.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (probability of winning 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (probability of losing 3000 Euros). The difference is 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (probability of losing 6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 55% (probability of winning 0 Euros). The difference is 10%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of losing for Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that the probability of losing was too high for Lottery A, but this statement seems to be incorrect given the context of the lotteries, as Lottery A has a lower probability of losing (10%) compared to the probability of losing in Lottery B (45% for a worse outcome). However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the translation or interpretation of ""zu verlieren,"" which typically means ""to lose,"" but in the context of lotteries, it might be referring to not winning or the probability of the negative outcome. The individual's justification seems to focus on the probability aspect but does not clearly align with the typical interpretation of lottery outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the probability of losing, which might relate to the probabilities but does not explicitly address the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (10% difference). The individual's justification, however, does not clearly support the use of this rule, as the focus is on the perceived high probability of losing in Lottery A, without directly comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% and the maximum probability is 99.8%, resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss of money in both lotteries, specifically comparing the potential loss of 3000€ in Lottery B to the potential loss of 6000€ in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the amount of potential loss, mentioning that Lottery B involves a potential loss of 3000€, which is less than the potential loss of 6000€ in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on the amount of potential loss.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as the verbal report does not mention the probabilities or their differences, and the justification is focused on the potential losses rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of getting 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for getting 1000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (since there's a 100% chance of getting 500 Euros), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of getting money in each lottery, noting that Lottery A has a 50% chance of getting money (or nothing), while Lottery B has a 100% chance of getting money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a 100% chance of getting money, as opposed to the 50% chance with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities within each lottery, while the individual focused on the probability of getting money in each lottery without explicitly mentioning the difference in probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual also chose Lottery B but justified this choice based on the certainty of getting money (100% chance), not explicitly on the difference in probabilities within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's verbal report indicates they chose Lottery B for its certainty, which aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities), but the report does not explicitly mention considering the difference in probabilities within each lottery as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of getting 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), but considering the structure, it effectively compares the range of probabilities associated with outcomes. However, the key comparison here is between the certain outcome in Lottery B and the variable outcomes in Lottery A. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% because there is only one outcome. Thus, the difference for Lottery B is 0% (100%-100%), and for Lottery A, considering the reasoning might be about the spread of possible outcomes, it's more about the certainty vs. uncertainty. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability range or spread for each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the potential loss of 1000 Euros in Lottery A versus the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B. The phrase ""ur 500€ verliere statt evtl. 1000€"" indicates a focus on the potential maximum loss in Lottery A compared to the certain loss in Lottery B. Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to hinge on the attractiveness of losing a certain amount of money (500 Euros) over potentially losing a larger amount (1000 Euros), which suggests a preference for certainty over uncertainty in this context. The individual's deliberation process, as described, focuses on the outcomes and their probabilities, specifically the certainty of the loss in Lottery B being more attractive than the potential larger loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the potential maximum loss in Lottery A vs. the certain loss in Lottery B), there seems to be a disconnect. The individual's focus is more on the outcome values and their certainty rather than the probability ranges per se. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (preferring the certain loss because it is smaller than the potential maximum loss), it appears the individual's reasoning is more aligned with avoiding the larger potential loss rather than directly considering the probability ranges. However, the essence of preferring certainty (which aligns with smaller probability range or difference) over uncertainty might suggest some indirect alignment with the decision reason, but it's not a direct application of considering probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there might be a very indirect alignment with the preference for certainty, the individual's reasoning as described does not directly apply the decision reason regarding the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The focus is more on the outcomes and their certainty rather than the probability ranges themselves."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), so the difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for 6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), so the difference is 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the last two outcomes of Lottery A together have a 50% probability of winning something.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the combined probability of winning in Lottery A, but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual’s justification does not directly relate to the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.
Based on these two comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision.

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% (for both -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing in Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 25% probabilities for the two loss outcomes and how they sum up to a 50% chance of losing, which they found too high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (implied, as the report discusses the risks of B) seems to be based on the perceived risk of losing in Lottery B, which they calculated as 50% by adding the probabilities of the two loss outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the cumulative risk of losing in Lottery B, not explicitly discussing the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 25% difference. However, the individual's justification is based on the perceived high risk of losing in Lottery B, which doesn't directly align with the rule of minimizing the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, their focus was on the cumulative risk of losing in Lottery B. This suggests that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are 99.8% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the amount in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the amount in Lottery B, although small, was 100% certain, implying that certainty played a significant role in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, which relates to the certainty mentioned by the individual. However, the individual does not explicitly discuss the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which aligns with preferring a 100% certain outcome (Lottery B) over one with a significant probability range (Lottery A). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B due to its certainty indirectly aligns with the principle of minimizing the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, as Lottery B has no such difference.

The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B aligns with the principle of the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. Although the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these differences, their emphasis on certainty suggests an implicit consideration of the probability ranges, leading to a positive assessment. However, the lack of explicit mention of probability differences prevents a full certainty that the decision reason was used as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss from each lottery, focusing on the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the higher potential loss in Lottery A, despite its lower probability.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the perceived safety of Lottery B, given the certain but smaller loss, and their personal belief about their luck, implying a preference for avoiding a potentially larger loss despite its low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations were more about the magnitude of potential losses and their personal luck rather than the probability ranges.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0%). The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery B, but based on different reasoning (perceived safety and personal luck).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as their decision criterion. Instead, their choice was influenced by the magnitude of potential losses and personal beliefs about luck, not aligning with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. 
For Lottery B, both outcomes have 50% probability, so the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. 
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is: Lottery A has a probability difference of 100% and Lottery B has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of getting 1500 Euros (Lottery A) versus the uncertainty of getting either 3000 Euros or -3000 Euros (Lottery B). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certainty of getting 1500 Euros because they do not want to risk not getting any money (or even losing money), indicating a preference for avoiding uncertainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the certainty versus uncertainty aspect. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability (which would be Lottery B), but the individual's justification is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not directly relate to the probability difference rule. 
Based on these comparisons, while the individual's preference for certainty could indirectly relate to preferring smaller probability differences (since Lottery A's certain outcome could be seen as less risky), the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification might align with the outcome of applying the decision reason (in terms of preferring a certain outcome over a risky one), the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason itself (focusing on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities) was directly used in the decision-making process. The individual's reasoning seems to be more about risk aversion and preference for certainty rather than explicitly considering the probability ranges of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference (0%) between their minimum and maximum probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the certainty of winning with Lottery A, even if it's less than what could be won, and compares it to the uncertainty of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the certainty of a win, even if it's a smaller amount, over the uncertainty of the other option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the certainty of winning with one lottery versus the uncertainty of the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a 0% difference. The individual's justification is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, which does not directly relate to the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, nor does their justification for the choice align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences, we note that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the context of the reason implies looking for the smallest difference in a scenario where differences might exist. In this specific case, both lotteries have the same outcome in terms of probability range (no range), but the reason's intent is to minimize risk or uncertainty, which is more directly achieved by a lottery with a guaranteed outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery B, highlighting the 100% probability of gaining 1000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed win, implying a preference for certainty over the uncertainty presented by Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which in this case is more about the concept of certainty and risk aversion rather than actual numerical differences. The individual considered the certainty of the outcome, which aligns with the spirit of preferring less uncertainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which in a broader interpretation, aligns with preferring a guaranteed outcome (as it implies no difference in outcome probability). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its guaranteed win, which can be seen as aligning with the principle of minimizing uncertainty or risk, even though the direct application of the reason (comparing probability differences) is not explicitly mentioned.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome and the preference for a guaranteed win aligns with the underlying principle of the decision reason, which is to minimize uncertainty or risk. While the decision reason is specifically about comparing probability differences, the individual's justification reflects a preference for certainty, which is in line with the reason's intent in a scenario where one option offers no risk. However, the direct application of comparing minimum and maximum probability differences is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report, preventing a 100% certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, which can be considered as both the minimum and maximum, so the difference is also 0%. However, given the nature of the reason, it seems to aim at identifying lotteries where the probabilities of outcomes are more evenly distributed or less variable. In this context, both lotteries present a situation where the difference in probabilities (0% for both) does not directly apply as intended by the reason, since it implicitly looks for a comparison where one lottery might have a wider spread of probabilities than the other. However, based on the strict interpretation of the reason, both lotteries have the same difference (0%), which might suggest indifference according to the reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""50/50 Chancen"" (50/50 chances), indicating they considered the probability distribution of one of the lotteries, specifically Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual expresses hesitation towards a 50/50 risk (""sehe ich mich irgendwie nicht so Risiko bereit""), suggesting that the equal probability of gain and loss in Lottery B makes them uncomfortable, implying a preference for avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which was not directly mentioned or implied in the individual's verbal report. The individual focused on the 50/50 risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability does not directly align with the individual's expressed concern about risk aversion in the face of a 50/50 chance. The individual's justification is more about risk aversion than about comparing probability spreads.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. Instead, their concern seems to be about the risk associated with the 50/50 chance, which does not align with the decision reason provided."
