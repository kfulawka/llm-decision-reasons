STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2400 + 2500 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2400 - 1825 = 575 Euros; for Lottery B, 2500 - 1825 = 675 Euros, 2400 - 1825 = 575 Euros, and 0 - 1825 = -1825 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual first compared the outcomes of A and B, then the chances. They mention that there is a fair chance to win 2400 or 2500 Euros with Lottery B, and the 1% chance of winning 0 Euros does not make a big difference for them. The individual considers the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities), it seems the individual does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the perceived fairness of winning 2400 or 2500 Euros with Lottery B and dismisses the low probability of winning 0 Euros, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers outcomes and probabilities, there is no clear indication they used the specific decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's thought process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 2500 - 1225 = 1275, 0 - 1225 = -1225, 2400 - 1225 = 1175, and 0 - 1225 = -1225. These differences are considered important, and the reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery B has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225), while Lottery A has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225). The decision reason can be applied by comparing these probabilities of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities (33% vs. 34%) and the potential winnings (higher gain with Lottery B if one wins). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the higher potential gain if they win, indicating that the 1% difference in probabilities does not significantly influence their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the direct comparison of potential winnings and the small difference in probabilities, not explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which would be Lottery A in this case because it has a slightly higher probability (34%) of achieving a positive outcome compared to Lottery B (33%). The individual, however, chose Lottery B for its higher potential gain, which aligns with preferring a higher outcome but does not directly reflect the decision reason’s focus on the probability of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not closely align with the decision reason's process of calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from that level. The individual's focus on the higher potential gain of Lottery B and the minimal impact of the probability difference on their decision suggests a simpler comparison rather than the application of the specific decision reason provided. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative); for Lottery B, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries (4000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, 3000 Euros for Lottery B) and their probabilities (80% for 4000 Euros in Lottery A, 100% for 3000 Euros in Lottery B). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the safety of the 100% probability of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B over the 80% probability of winning 4000 Euros in Lottery A, despite the risk of losing 20% of the time in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities, which is relevant to calculating the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. However, there is no explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or considering the probability of positive differences between outcomes and this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, while the individual preferred the safer option with a 100% probability of a positive outcome (3000 Euros), without explicitly mentioning the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the safety of a 100% probability of winning, which aligns with risk aversion but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific criteria of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The aspiration level and its associated calculations are not mentioned in the verbal report, suggesting that the individual did not explicitly use this decision reason. However, the concern for safety and avoiding loss indicates some alignment with the concept of preferring outcomes that are more reliably positive, albeit not in the specific terms defined by the decision reason. Thus, while there is some indirect alignment, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not evident in the verbal report."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750; for Lottery B, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 and 0 - 1750 = -1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of winnings between A and B and then looked at the probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Lottery B more attractive due to its 25% chance of winning 3000 Euros being higher than the 20% chance of winning in Lottery A, despite the 100€ difference in potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual considered the amounts of winnings and the probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences relative to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because of its higher probability of winning a positive amount (25% vs. 20%), but this reasoning is based on the absolute probabilities of winning rather than the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's focus on the probabilities of winning and the attractiveness of Lottery B due to its higher probability, without explicit consideration of an aspiration level or comparison of probabilities of positive differences from such a level, suggests that the decision reason was not directly used. However, the consideration of probabilities and the preference for the lottery with a higher chance of a positive outcome shares a superficial similarity with the decision reason's focus on probabilities of positive differences, preventing a complete dismissal of the possibility that some aspect of the reason influenced the decision. Thus, the assessment is low but not at the absolute minimum."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 45% (since only the 6000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level), and for Lottery B, it is 90% (since the 3000 Euro outcome is above the aspiration level).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities of Lotteries A and B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it is safer, with a 90% chance of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, which does not directly match the information considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, whereas the individual chose based on the higher probability of winning, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its higher probability of winning, which does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences as described in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (3000 + 0 + 6000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 4500 = -1500 Euros and 0 - 4500 = -4500 Euros; for Lottery B, 6000 - 4500 = 1500 Euros and 0 - 4500 = -4500 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery B has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference (1500 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0.2% probability of a positive difference (3000 Euros is not a positive difference in this context, but rather -1500 Euros, which is negative). However, since the only positive difference comes from Lottery B's 6000 Euros outcome, we need to focus on the probability of getting a positive outcome. Lottery B offers a positive outcome with a probability of 0.1%, and Lottery A offers a positive outcome (albeit less than the aspiration level) with a probability of 0.2%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes (amounts of money) and the probabilities of the lotteries but stated that the amounts were relatively unimportant due to the low probabilities of winning. The individual focused on the comparison between the probabilities (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and the potential winnings if one were to win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, given the low probabilities of winning, they preferred the higher potential winnings of 6000 Euros if they were to win, despite the lower probability of winning with Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, seemed to focus more on the potential winnings and the fact that the probabilities of winning were low, rather than explicitly calculating or considering an aspiration level or the differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this context would not directly apply as described since both lotteries offer outcomes below and above the aspiration level, but with different probabilities. The individual's justification, however, was based on the preference for the higher potential winnings if they were to win, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s focus on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on the potential winnings and the low probabilities, without explicit consideration of an aspiration level or the differences from it, indicating that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since only Lottery A offers a possibility of a positive difference (20% chance of 0 Euros, which is 1000 Euros above the aspiration level), this reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with 100% probability in Lottery B and the chance of losing nothing (0 Euros) with 20% probability in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid the certain loss of 3000 Euros, hoping to get lucky with the 20% chance of losing nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the risk and the chance of avoiding loss but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a chance, albeit small, of not losing money, which aligns with seeking a positive outcome but does not directly reference the aspiration level or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A (avoiding a certain loss and hoping for the best with a chance of no loss) does not directly align with the decision reason's specific process (calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences). However, the choice does reflect a desire to avoid a certain negative outcome in favor of a gamble that includes a possibility of a more favorable outcome, which indirectly relates to the concept of seeking positive differences from a reference point (in this case, not explicitly stated as an aspiration level but potentially inferred as a desire to avoid loss).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly match the decision reason's specifics about calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. The choice reflects a more general risk aversion or loss aversion principle rather than the specific decision reason provided. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual in making the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: -4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level = (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: -4000 - (-1750) = -2250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
- For Lottery B: -3000 - (-1750) = -1250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, both lotteries have a positive difference of 1750 with probabilities of 80% and 75%, respectively, for Lottery A and Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the outcomes and their corresponding probabilities of the two lotteries, focusing on the loss amounts (-4000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B) and mentioning that the 25% probability of Lottery B ""hat keine große Rolle gespielt"" (played no significant role).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by comparing the loss amounts of the two lotteries and downplaying the significance of the 25% probability associated with Lottery B, implying that the magnitude of the loss was a more critical factor than the probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of losses and the probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would involve comparing the 80% probability of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) in Lottery A to the 75% in Lottery B. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly address the comparison of probabilities of positive outcomes but rather emphasizes the difference in potential losses and seems to dismiss the importance of the probability associated with Lottery B.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly follow the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on the magnitude of potential losses and the perceived significance of the probabilities without calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros (for both lotteries), and -3000 Euros.
- The aspiration level = (-6000 + 0 + 0 - 3000) / 4 = -4500 / 4 = -1125 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this aspiration level. We need to calculate the differences of each outcome from the aspiration level and consider their probabilities.

- For Lottery A: The difference for -6000 Euros is -6000 - (-1125) = -4875 Euros, and for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125 Euros.
- For Lottery B: The difference for -3000 Euros is -3000 - (-1125) = -1875 Euros, and for 0 Euros, it's 0 - (-1125) = 1125 Euros.

Given the aspiration level and the differences, we can proceed to analyze the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss (Verlust) associated with each lottery and the probability of that loss. Specifically, they looked at the maximum amount that could be lost and the chance of losing it.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because the potential loss in Lottery A (-6000 Euros) was too high, even though the probability of this loss (45%) was considered. The individual preferred to ""sicher gehen"" (play it safe) and minimize the loss, which led them to choose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on minimizing losses and the probability of those losses, without explicit mention of an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, was based on minimizing the potential loss, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which involves a specific calculation of an aspiration level and comparison of outcomes to this level.

10,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros (twice, since it appears in both lotteries), and -3000 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (-6000 + 0 + 0 + (-3000)) / 4 = -4500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-4500) = -1500; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-4500) = 4500; and for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-4500) = 1500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the only positive differences are associated with the 0 Euro outcome (which happens with 99.9% probability in Lottery B and 99.8% in Lottery A) and the -3000 Euro outcome (which happens with 0.2% probability in Lottery A), we need to compare these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual first looked at the loss and then compared the chances between the two options. They considered the probabilities of losing less than 0.2% and the magnitude of the loss (-3000 Euros vs. -6000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual was convinced by the smaller loss of -3000 Euros in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, particularly preferring the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of the loss and the comparison of probabilities, without explicit mention of calculating or considering an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule is based on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual’s justification is based on the smaller loss in absolute terms.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the aspiration level and the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the magnitude of the potential loss and a comparison of probabilities, without evidence of considering an aspiration level or its associated positive differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 1000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 500 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive), 0 - 500 = -500 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 500 - 500 = 0 (no difference)
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities:
- Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (500 Euros more than the aspiration level) and a 50% chance of a negative difference.
- Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since it equals the aspiration level) and a 0% chance of a negative difference, but it guarantees no loss or gain relative to the aspiration level.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual looked at the gains first and then compared the chances between A and B. They found Lottery A attractive because of the 50% chance to win 1000 Euros but were deterred by the 50% chance to lose. They chose Lottery B to be safe, with a 100% chance of getting 500 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification for choosing B over A was to avoid the risk of losing (getting 0 Euros) and to guarantee a gain of 500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the attractiveness of the gains and the risks of losing, which indirectly touches upon the idea of comparing outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the probability of being above or below it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose the lottery that guarantees a certain outcome, avoiding the risk of getting nothing, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule since the individual did not explicitly discuss probabilities of being above or below an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not closely align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual did consider the outcomes and their associated probabilities, the focus was more on the guarantee of a certain outcome rather than on the concept of aspiration levels and probabilities of exceeding them. Thus, it seems unlikely that the individual used the specific decision reason provided to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, let's break down the process into the required steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (500 Euros) is 50%, and in Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (0 Euros) is 0% since the outcome is exactly at the aspiration level, not above it. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing half of their initial endowment (2000 Euros) with Lottery A, which has a 50% chance of losing 1000 Euros. They compared this to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because losing 500 Euros was seen as safer than the risk of losing 1000 Euros with a 50% probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes being better than this level. The individual's consideration of losing half of their endowment and comparing the losses between the two lotteries does not directly mention or imply the calculation of an aspiration level or the comparison of outcomes against such a level based on their probabilities of being positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the perceived safety of losing a smaller amount of money, which aligns with risk aversion but does not explicitly mention or imply the concept of aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences from such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of probabilities of positive differences from such a level in their decision-making process. Their justification is based on a direct comparison of potential losses and the perceived safety of one option over the other, which does not align with the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000, 2000, and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 and 0 Euros. However, to calculate the aspiration level as per the decision reason, we consider all unique outcomes from both lotteries: 6000, 2000, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery A, the differences are (4000-2666.67), (2000-2666.67), and (0-2666.67), which simplifies to 1333.33, -666.67, and -2666.67 Euros, respectively. For Lottery B, the differences are (6000-2666.67) and (0-2666.67), which simplifies to 3333.33 and -2666.67 Euros, respectively. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and gains of both lotteries, focusing on the attractiveness of winning something in three different scenarios with Lottery A, given its split chances. They also considered the risk of earning nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Lottery A more attractive due to the possibility of winning something in multiple scenarios and perceived the risk of earning nothing with Lottery B as too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of winning something in multiple scenarios and the risk of earning nothing can be seen as related to the concept of positive outcomes but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A because it offered a chance to win something in more scenarios, which can be interpreted as preferring the lottery with more positive outcomes, but this does not directly align with the specific rule of comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While there is a vague alignment in preferring positive outcomes, the process described does not closely follow the decision reason's rule, leading to a low assessment score."

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as the mean of these outcomes: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -6000 - (-2200) = -3800 and 0 - (-2200) = 2200; for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, and 0 - (-2200) = 2200. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of losses in each lottery and then considered the probabilities. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the high loss of -6000 Euros in Lottery A being too high even at a 25% chance, and noted the maximum losses in Lottery B are -4000 Euros or -2000 Euros, each at a 25% chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering differences from this level, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual focused on the magnitude of losses and their probabilities but did not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification was based on the absolute magnitude of potential losses and their associated probabilities, without explicit reference to an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of outcomes better than a certain threshold.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's reliance on an aspiration level and the preference for the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on the magnitude of losses and their probabilities, not on an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 5000 Euros, 0 Euros, and 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 5005 / 3 ≈ 1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 5000 Euros, the difference is 5000 - 1671.67 ≈ 3328.33 Euros; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - 1671.67 ≈ -1671.67 Euros; and for 5 Euros, the difference is 5 - 1671.67 ≈ -1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0.1% (the chance of winning 5000 Euros), and in Lottery B, there is no positive difference since the outcome (5 Euros) is less than the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high potential gain of 5000 Euros in Lottery A but noted the very low probability (0.1%) of achieving it. They also considered the guaranteed gain of 5 Euros in Lottery B with a 100% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite its lower potential gain, it offered a guaranteed win, which was more appealing than the low-probability high gain of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the probability of positive differences from such a level. Instead, they focus on the attractiveness of the high gain in Lottery A versus the certainty of the smaller gain in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the appeal of a guaranteed win over a highly uncertain but larger win, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The report focuses on the trade-off between the high but unlikely gain and the certain but smaller gain, without mentioning the concept of an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery A, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given Lottery B has a 99.9% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being a positive difference compared to the aspiration level) and Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference, but the magnitude and the context of the aspiration level calculation make the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries and their probabilities, focusing on the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds Lottery B more attractive due to its low chance of loss (0.1%) compared to the guaranteed loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A, indicating a preference for avoiding certain loss over the potential for a larger loss with a very low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on the low probability of a significant loss and the avoidance of a guaranteed loss, which aligns with considering outcomes and their implications but does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or probabilities of positive differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers Lottery B because of its low chance of loss, which can be seen as related to preferring positive outcomes (in this case, 0 Euros) but does not directly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to align with preferring outcomes that are more favorable in terms of loss avoidance, which shares a spirit with the decision reason's focus on positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the explicit calculation and consideration of an aspiration level and its direct influence on the decision are not clearly outlined in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects a leaning towards the decision reason not being explicitly used as described, given the lack of direct mention of an aspiration level and the focus on probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual's justification does reflect a consideration of the attractiveness of outcomes in a manner that is not entirely unrelated to the decision reason, preventing a complete dismissal of its influence."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 500 = 2500, -3000 - 500 = -3500, and 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the possibility of losing with Lottery B (50% chance of -3000 Euros) and the guaranteed gain of Lottery A (1500 Euros with 100% probability). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the risk associated with Lottery B being too high compared to the guaranteed gain of Lottery A. However, the individual seems to have made a contradictory statement by saying ""Um sicher zu gehen für einen garantierten Gewinn, ist B die bessere Lotterie"" which translates to ""To be sure of a guaranteed win, B is the better lottery"", which does not align with the rest of the report.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level, differences between outcomes and aspiration level) with that considered by the individual (possibility of losing with B, guaranteed gain of A), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and aspiration level.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual's justification for the choice (focusing on the risk and guaranteed gain), it seems that the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason. The individual's contradictory statement further complicates the assessment.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the consideration of differences between outcomes and aspiration level, which are crucial components of the decision reason. The justification provided by the individual focuses on risk and guaranteed gain, which does not align with the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2000 + 3000 - 3000) / 3 = 0. This means the aspiration level is 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 2000 Euros for Lottery A, 3000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery B, and -3000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery A and the risk of loss associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the high risk of loss associated with Lottery B, implying that the certainty of gain from Lottery A was more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the risk of loss and the certainty of gain, which aligns with considering outcomes relative to a reference point (like the aspiration level of 0 Euros), but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery A due to its certainty and the perceived high risk of loss in Lottery B, which indirectly suggests a preference for avoiding negative deviations from a reference point (possibly the aspiration level of 0 Euros), but does not directly address the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and preferring a certain gain aligns somewhat with the concept of preferring positive outcomes over negative ones relative to an aspiration level. However, the explicit calculation of an aspiration level and the comparison of probabilities of positive differences, as required by the decision reason, are not mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, while there is a slight alignment in the preference for positive outcomes, the specific process outlined by the decision reason does not seem to be directly followed by the individual."

This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing with Lottery B and the guaranteed gain of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid the high risk of losing with Lottery B and to guarantee a win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual considered the risk and the guarantee, not explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and this level.

The individual preferred the lottery with a guaranteed gain to avoid risk, which is related to but does not directly mention the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding risk and guaranteeing a gain does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While there's a vague connection between risk aversion and the concept of aspiration levels, the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply the use of the aspiration level or the calculation of differences from it as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the general theme of risk aversion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level = (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for the outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A offers a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery B offers 0% chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level), we can derive the relevant information for the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes of Lottery A (the possibility of winning or losing 6000 Euros) and the certainty of getting 0 Euros from Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the 50% chance of losing in Lottery A was too high, making the certainty of getting 0 Euros from Lottery B the safer option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual focused on the outcomes of the lotteries and the risk associated with Lottery A but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual chose Lottery B because it was perceived as safer, avoiding the risk of loss in Lottery A, rather than explicitly seeking a higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus was on avoiding risk rather than on the specific rule of maximizing the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
