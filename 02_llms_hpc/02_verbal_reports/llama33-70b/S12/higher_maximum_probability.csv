STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 66% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2400 Euros). This information is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the gain is certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty (100% probability) of the gain in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with 100% probability, aligning with the individual's justification that the gain in Lottery A is certain.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 67% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's also 66% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are roughly the same (""Fast die selbe Wahrscheinlichkeit""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the higher gain (""höheren Gewinn""), since the probabilities were perceived as similar.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the higher gain): The individual considered the probabilities but focused on the gain when they perceived the probabilities as similar.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (chose based on the higher gain due to similar probabilities): The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not align because the individual based their decision on the potential gain when they saw the probabilities as roughly equal, not on the maximum probability of each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, as their justification was based on the higher potential gain when perceiving the probabilities as similar, not on comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for winning 4000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 100% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which are 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of receiving a certain amount of money with 100% probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the option because it guaranteed a 100% chance of receiving a certain amount of money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the guarantee of 100% probability), we see that the individual did focus on the aspect of probability, specifically the guarantee of 100% probability, which aligns with considering the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing the option with a 100% guarantee), it is clear that the individual's decision aligns with the decision reason's rule since the individual preferred the lottery (B) with the higher maximum probability (100%).

To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, it's also 80% (for the 0 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these maximum probabilities, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher payout of Lottery B and the better probability (quote) of Lottery A. They also noted that the probabilities (or quotes) of the two lotteries differ by only 5 percentage points, suggesting they are approximately equal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite A having a better probability, the difference in probabilities is small (5 percentage points), making them seem roughly equal, and B has a higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 75% for A and 80% for B. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities associated with the payouts (25% for A and 20% for B) and their difference, not directly on the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher maximum probability (80% vs. 75%). The individual, however, chose B due to its higher payout and the small difference in probabilities related to the payouts, not explicitly because of the maximum probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The individual's focus was on the payout and the difference in probabilities related to winning, not the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 45% (for winning 6000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of winning for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning (or ""Wahrscheinlichkeit auf einen Gewinn"") for each option.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option A because the probability of winning is greater (""weil dort die Wahrscheinlichkeit auf einen Gewinn größer ist"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of winning for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning), we see they align as the individual also considered the probability of winning.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability of winning) to the individual’s justification (choosing Option A because it has a greater probability of winning), we observe that the individual's justification matches the rule of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros) and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros). Since these probabilities can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information is the maximum probability of each lottery: 99.8% for Lottery A and 99.9% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that the probabilities of both options are low (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeiten sind bei beiden Optionen gering""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual states they chose the option with more money (""die Option mit mehr Geld gewählt""), which implies their decision was based on the monetary value of the outcomes rather than the probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) with that considered by the individual (low probabilities in general), it seems the individual did consider probabilities but not specifically the maximum probability as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing the option with more money), it appears the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual focused on the monetary value, not the maximum probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% (associated with -4000 Euros), and for Lottery A, it's 100% (associated with -3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possibility of getting 0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery B, implying they considered the outcomes and their associated probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the aspect of not getting a negative amount (0 Euros) in Lottery B with a certain probability, but does not explicitly state a preference based on the maximum probability of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the maximum probability of each lottery, which the individual does seem to touch upon by mentioning a specific probability but not directly comparing the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing maximum probabilities or preferring based on this rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report hints at an awareness of the probabilities but does not clearly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the maximum probability. The focus on the 20% chance of not losing in Lottery B does not directly relate to comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (associated with 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 75% (associated with 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery A because it has a higher maximum probability (80%) compared to Lottery B (75%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions going out of the game with fewer debts, which implies a consideration of the potential losses (-4000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B) rather than the probabilities directly.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about minimizing potential debt (""mit weniger Schulden aus dem Spiel geht""), which translates to ""with fewer debts out of the game."" This suggests the individual is focusing on the monetary outcomes, specifically the loss amounts, rather than the probabilities of those outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, while the individual seems to focus on the monetary outcomes (specifically, the potential debt).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on minimizing debt, not comparing probabilities.
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. Instead, the individual's decision seems to be influenced by the potential monetary losses associated with each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 90% (for -3000 Euros), and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 55% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of getting 0 Euros versus incurring a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Option B because the chance of getting 0 Euros (instead of a loss) is greater.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the chance of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is about avoiding a loss, not directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the chance of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros), which does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (associated with a 0 Euro outcome), and for Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.8% (also associated with a 0 Euro outcome). Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability regardless of the outcome, the relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. The key information is that Lottery B has a higher maximum probability (99.9%) than Lottery A (99.8%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probabilities are almost the same (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeiten sind fast gleich""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on choosing the smaller loss (""daher habe ich mich für den kleineren Verlust entschieden""), implying their decision was influenced by the potential losses of -6000 Euros for Lottery B and -3000 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities, which the individual acknowledges are ""almost the same,"" but does not directly compare them in a manner that suggests using the maximum probability to decide.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on choosing the smaller loss, not directly on the probabilities of the outcomes.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for the outcome of 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both outcomes (1000 Euros and 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% probability of 500 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% probability of 1000 Euros and 50% probability of 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the certainty of the gain (100% probability) in Lottery A and the uncertainty of the gain in Lottery B (50% chance of winning 1000 Euros or 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery A because the gain was 100% certain, whereas Lottery B had a 50-50 chance, which included the possibility of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual considered the certainty (100% probability) of the gain in Lottery A and the uncertainty (50% probability) of the gain in Lottery B, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a 100% certain gain, which directly aligns with preferring the option based on the higher maximum probability (100% for Lottery A vs. 50% for Lottery B).

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability = 50% (since both outcomes have the same probability)
- Lottery B: Maximum probability = 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the probabilities of the outcomes, specifically mentioning the 50-50 chance of at least getting 0 Euros with Lottery A and the certainty of loss with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B (""der Verlust ist gewiss"") and the uncertainty but potential for no loss in Lottery A (""50 zu 50 Chance wenigstens mit 0 herauszugehen"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason requires the comparison of the maximum probabilities, which are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. The individual discusses the certainty and uncertainty of outcomes but does not explicitly compare the maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 100% probability. The individual's justification, however, seems to weigh the certainty of loss against the potential for no loss, without explicitly stating a preference for the higher maximum probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is closer to 0 because the individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason based on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus is more on the certainty of loss in one option and the gamble in the other, rather than explicitly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, it's not a 0 because the discussion about certainty and uncertainty touches upon the concept of probability, but it does not align closely with the specific decision reason provided."

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived higher probability of gaining something with Option A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of any outcome in each lottery, while the individual talks about the probability of making a gain, which aligns with considering probabilities but is specifically focused on positive outcomes rather than the maximum probability of any outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its 75% probability of one outcome. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the chance of gaining something, which might not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of any outcome.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning is related to probabilities but does not directly match the decision reason's specific criteria of comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's focus is more on the probability of winning rather than the maximum probability of any outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual considers probabilities, the specific decision reason provided does not exactly match the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, and the individual chooses Option A because it has a higher probability of a specific outcome (0 Euros), which is the maximum probability in this case.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability, but the individual's justification (focusing on the probability of getting 0 Euros) directly corresponds to the aspect of the decision reason that considers the maximum probability of each lottery.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% for winning 0 Euros, but it also has a 0.1% probability of winning 5000 Euros. The key information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a 100% probability of a certain outcome, while Lottery B's highest probability is 99.9% for a different outcome.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the certainty of Option A (""Option A ist sicher"") and the relative improbability of realizing a high gain with Option B (""Option B ist relativ unwahrscheinlich einen so hohen Gewinn zu realisieren""). The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the certainty of Option A and the low probability of the high gain in Option B. The deliberation process described emphasizes the probability aspects of the outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (certainty of Option A and low probability of high gain in Option B), there is a match in the focus on probabilities. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, which aligns with the individual's emphasis on the certainty (100% probability) of Option A. The individual's justification for choosing Option A over Option B because of its certainty (which translates to a higher maximum probability for a positive outcome) suggests the use of the decision reason. Therefore, the decision reason was likely used by the individual.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we proceed step-by-step.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and for Lottery B, it is 100% (for the -5 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. The decision reason can be applied by comparing these maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of Lottery A (""Die Wahrscheinlichkeit bei Option A ist zwar gering""), indicating they considered the probability aspect of Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose Lottery B (""ich würde mich dennoch für B entscheiden"") despite acknowledging the low probability of the negative outcome in Lottery A, but does not explicitly state why they prefer B over A beyond mentioning the probability of A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of Lottery A), it appears the individual considered probabilities but not explicitly the maximum probabilities of both lotteries as the decision reason would require.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (choosing B without explicitly stating why in terms of probabilities), the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual's choice was based on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, while the individual considered probabilities, the verbal report does not clearly align with the specific rule of the decision reason (comparing maximum probabilities to make the choice). Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not.

The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 1500 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Maximum probability of Lottery A: 50%
- Maximum probability of Lottery B: 100%
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the risk of losing money in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because it provides a certain gain, unlike Lottery A, where there's a risk of losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual considered the certainty of gain and the risk of loss. Although related, the individual's focus is more on the outcome certainty rather than directly comparing maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which aligns with choosing Lottery B due to its 100% probability of a positive outcome. The individual's justification indirectly reflects this by valuing the certainty (100% probability) of the gain in Lottery B over the uncertainty of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability), the verbal report does not directly mention comparing maximum probabilities. However, the emphasis on certainty and avoiding loss implies an understanding that aligns with the principle of preferring higher probability outcomes, thus indicating a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, but not with absolute certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 2000 Euros). 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros). 
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered that Option A guarantees a win (""auf jeden Fall einen Gewinn sicher""), implying they recognized the 100% probability of winning 2000 Euros in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification for choosing Option A is that it guarantees a win, which aligns with recognizing the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the guaranteed win (100% probability) of Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, and the individual chose Lottery A because it guarantees a win (has a 100% probability), which is the lottery with the higher maximum probability in this scenario. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they prioritized the guaranteed outcome (100% probability) of Lottery A over Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros outcomes). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the 1000 Euros outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probabilities of the lotteries: 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the possibility of making a loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the gain is certain and there's no risk of making a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk of loss): While the individual's consideration of certainty and risk indirectly relates to the concept of probability, it does not directly address the maximum probability of each lottery as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on certainty of gain and avoidance of loss): The individual's justification aligns with preferring a certain gain (which corresponds to a 100% probability), but it does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the decision was made by directly comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The focus on certainty and avoidance of loss suggests an understanding of probability but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific rule about maximum probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes of 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Thus, Lottery A has a maximum probability of 100%, and Lottery B has a maximum probability of 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""50 zu 50"" (50 to 50), which refers to the equal probability of the two outcomes in Lottery B. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes in Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's statement ""No Risk, no Fun"" suggests a preference for taking risks, implying a justification for choosing Lottery B over Lottery A, which offers no risk (and no potential gain or loss). The phrase ""Immerhin 50 zu 50"" (at least 50 to 50) further suggests that the equal chance of a significant gain or loss is a factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual: The individual discusses the probabilities of Lottery B but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the presence of risk and the equal probability of outcomes in Lottery B, rather than explicitly preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. In fact, the decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its 100% maximum probability, which contradicts the individual's choice of Lottery B.
