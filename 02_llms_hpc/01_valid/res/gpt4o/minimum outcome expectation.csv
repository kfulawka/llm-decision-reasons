minimum outcome expectation
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason considers the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
- For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%.
- For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.
- Therefore, relevant information:
  - Lottery A: 0 Euros * 1% = 0
  - Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 100% = 2400

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem strictly according to the decision reason’s rule.
- Comparing the products:
  - Lottery A: 0
  - Lottery B: 2400
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product, which is Lottery B in this case.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly to the decision problem:
   - The decision reason requires evaluating the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - Lottery A: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 67% (0.67).
   - Lottery B: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 66% (0.66).
   - For both lotteries, the product of the minimum outcome and its probability is 0 Euros.
   - Since the product calculation results in the same value for both lotteries, the decision reason can be applied, and relevant information can be derived.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Calculate the product for Lottery A: \( 0 \text{ Euros} \times 0.67 = 0 \text{ Euros} \)
   - Calculate the product for Lottery B: \( 0 \text{ Euros} \times 0.66 = 0 \text{ Euros} \)
   - Both products are equal, therefore the reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess the decision reason and derive relevant information.
- Lottery A: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros and its probability is 20%.
- Lottery B: The minimum outcome is 3000 Euros and its probability is 100%.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason by calculating the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
- For Lottery A: 0 Euros * 20% = 0
- For Lottery B: 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000

Since the product for Lottery B (3000) is greater than the product for Lottery A (0), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
1. Identify the minimum outcome for each lottery.
   - Lottery A: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B: The minimum outcome is 0 Euros.

2. Determine the probability associated with the minimum outcome for each lottery.
   - Lottery A: Probability of 0 Euros is 80%.
   - Lottery B: Probability of 0 Euros is 75%.

3. Calculate the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - Lottery A: 0 Euros * 80% = 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B: 0 Euros * 75% = 0 Euros.

4. Compare the products calculated for each lottery.
   - Both products are equal (0 Euros).

5. Since the products are equal, the decision reason is indifferent between the lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - Lottery A has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 55%.
   - Lottery B has a minimum outcome of 0 Euros with a probability of 10%.
   - The products of the minimum outcome and its probability can be derived for both lotteries: 
     - For Lottery A: 0 Euros * 0.55 = 0
     - For Lottery B: 0 Euros * 0.10 = 0
   - Both products are 0, hence the relevant information can be derived.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - According to the decision reason, we compare the products of the minimum outcome and its probability.
   - Both lotteries have the same product of 0.
   - Hence, the decision reason does not prefer one lottery over the other.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied:
   - The decision reason requires calculating the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - Both lotteries have 0 Euros as the minimum outcome with their respective probabilities of 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B.

2. Calculate the relevant product for each lottery:
   - For Lottery A: \(0 \text{ Euros} \times 99.9\% = 0\)
   - For Lottery B: \(0 \text{ Euros} \times 99.8\% = 0\)

3. Apply the decision reason:
   - Since the products are equal, the decision reason indicates indifference between the two lotteries.

FINAL ANSWER: INDIFFERENT"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.
   - Therefore, the decision reason can be applied strictly.

2. Summarize the information relevant to the decision reason:
   - Lottery A: Minimum outcome = -4000 Euros with a probability of 80%.
     Product for Lottery A = -4000 * 0.80 = -3200
   - Lottery B: Minimum outcome = -3000 Euros with a probability of 100%.
     Product for Lottery B = -3000 * 1.00 = -3000

3. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - Compare the products:
     - Lottery A: -3200
     - Lottery B: -3000
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product. Since -3000 (Lottery B) is higher than -3200 (Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
- For Lottery A: The minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a probability of 20%.
- For Lottery B: The minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 25%.
- The relevant information is the product of the minimum outcome and its probability for both lotteries:
  - For Lottery A: -4000 Euros * 20% = -800 Euros
  - For Lottery B: -3000 Euros * 25% = -750 Euros
- Since the product of the minimum outcome and its probability can be derived from the given information, proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Compare the products:
  - Lottery A: -800 Euros
  - Lottery B: -750 Euros
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product (closer to zero), which in this case is Lottery B (-750 Euros is greater than -800 Euros).

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS:

1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
- The decision reason requires us to consider the products of the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
- For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 45%.
- For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 90%.
- These relevant pieces of information can be derived from the lotteries, so we proceed to summarize them.

Summary:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome = -6000 Euros, Probability of minimum outcome = 45%
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome = -3000 Euros, Probability of minimum outcome = 90%

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
- Calculate the product for each lottery:
  - For Lottery A: -6000 Euros * 45% = -2700 Euros
  - For Lottery B: -3000 Euros * 90% = -2700 Euros
- Both products are equal at -2700 Euros.

Since the products of the minimum outcomes and their probabilities are equal for both lotteries, the decision reason considers both lotteries equally preferable.

"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason requires examining the minimum outcome and its probability for each lottery.
   - For Lottery A:
     - Minimum outcome: -6000 Euros
     - Probability of minimum outcome: 0.1%
     - Product: -6000 Euros * 0.1% = -6000 * 0.001 = -6
