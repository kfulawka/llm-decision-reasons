STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason involves calculating the mean difference of outcomes from a reference value, considering their probabilities. The reference value is the sure outcome if available, or zero otherwise. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros, which becomes our reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros with 33% probability, 2400 Euros with 66% probability, and 0 Euros with 1% probability. The differences from the reference value (2400 Euros) are +100 Euros for the 2500 Euros outcome, 0 Euros for the 2400 Euros outcome, and -2400 Euros for the 0 Euros outcome. The decision reason will calculate the mean difference for Lottery A and compare it to Lottery B's mean difference (which is 0, since it's the reference point).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the 1% chance of losing as ""praktisch irrelevant"" (practically irrelevant) and views the 33% chance as ""signifikant"" (significant). This suggests the individual is considering the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the negligible risk (1% chance of losing) was worth taking to potentially increase their probable gain. This implies the individual is weighing the risks and potential gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences of outcomes from a reference value and their probabilities. The individual discusses the probabilities and the idea of taking a risk for a potential gain, which aligns with considering how the outcomes' differences and their probabilities might influence the decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between a small risk and a potential increase in gain, which can be seen as considering the mean difference in outcomes, albeit not explicitly calculating it.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's thought process aligns with the general principle of weighing the potential gains against the risks, which is central to the decision reason provided. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value, which are key components of the decision reason. The verbal report suggests an intuitive application of risk assessment rather than a strict adherence to the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment indicates a leaning towards the individual using a reasoning process that shares similarities with the decision reason, particularly in considering the trade-offs between risks and potential gains. However, it is not a perfect match due to the lack of explicit mention of calculating mean differences or using a reference value as specified in the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating the mean difference between outcomes and a reference value. Since there's no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes (2500 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B, 2400 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A) and their respective probabilities (33% and 67% for Lottery B, 34% and 66% for Lottery A). The decision reason can be applied by calculating the expected value or mean difference for each lottery and comparing them.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low but not unrealistic chance of winning in both lotteries and the similarity in the numerical values of the outcomes. They focused on the trade-off between the potential loss of 100 Euros in the winning amount and the increase in the winning probability by one percentage point.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by prioritizing the reduction of the risk of winning nothing over the potential gain of 100 Euros more in the winning scenario, given the high risk of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the trade-off between the outcomes, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically involves calculating mean differences and considering their probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification revolves around mitigating the risk of not winning, which can be seen as related to considering the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or comparing them directly.

Given these comparisons, the individual's thought process seems to align with aspects of the decision reason, such as considering probabilities and outcomes, but does not directly mention calculating and comparing mean differences as the decision reason dictates. However, the focus on risk mitigation and the trade-off between outcome values and probabilities suggests an intuitive application of principles similar to those of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60"
3,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability, so the reference value is 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of each lottery and their respective probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are: for Lottery A, 0 (since 3000 - 3000 = 0); for Lottery B, the differences are 1000 (4000 - 3000) with 80% probability and -3000 (0 - 3000) with 20% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros by choosing Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and compared it to the sure outcome of Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the sure route (Lottery A) because the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, although small (20%), was not negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the mean difference considering the differences' probabilities, which includes understanding the risk (losing 3000 Euros) and the gain (gaining 1000 Euros) associated with Lottery B compared to the sure outcome of Lottery A. The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences based on probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities, which implies a quantitative evaluation of risks and rewards. The individual's justification focuses on avoiding a perceived risk without explicitly calculating or comparing mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding risk and their comparison of the lotteries based on the potential loss aligns somewhat with considering differences from a reference point, but the decision reason involves a more quantitative approach of calculating mean differences based on probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in considering risks, the methodical approach of the decision reason does not clearly match the individual's justification process."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, and calculates the mean difference between the outcomes and a reference value. In this case, since there is no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros with 20% probability, 0 Euros with 80% probability
The mean difference for Lottery A is (3000 * 0.25) - (0 * 0.75) = 750, and for Lottery B is (4000 * 0.20) - (0 * 0.80) = 800.
This information is derivable from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a similar decision-making process in a different lottery scenario, implying they consider the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual values significantly increasing their chances of success over maximizing their potential gain in a lottery with low but realistic probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The individual seems to consider probabilities and outcomes, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities, which translates to preferring the lottery that offers a higher expected value in this context. The individual's justification focuses on increasing their chances of success, which could imply preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning, even if the potential gain is lower (Lottery A in this case, with 25% probability vs. Lottery B's 20% probability).

Given the information and the individual's justification, it seems the individual prioritizes increasing their chances of winning over maximizing the potential gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences (or expected value in this scenario). However, the individual's consideration of probabilities and the mention of a similar decision process in another scenario suggest some alignment with the principles of evaluating outcomes and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30

This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's decision, given the individual's stated preference for increasing their chances of success over maximizing gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria of preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference based on the outcomes and their probabilities."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there's no sure outcome in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries:
- Lottery A: 6000 Euros with 45% probability, 0 Euros with 55% probability.
- Lottery B: 3000 Euros with 90% probability, 0 Euros with 10% probability.
The mean difference for Lottery A is (6000 * 0.45) - (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros, and for Lottery B is (3000 * 0.90) - (0 * 0.10) = 2700 Euros.
Given this, the decision reason can be applied as it involves calculating the mean differences between the outcomes and the reference value (0 in this case) and comparing them.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B and considers 3000€ a ""ziemlich hoher Gewinnwert"" (a fairly high win value). They also mention the risk associated with the 45% chance of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) for a win, indicating a preference for the higher probability of winning over the potential for a higher reward with lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and probabilities, but the individual's verbal report focuses on the high probability of winning in Lottery B and the attractiveness of a ""fairly high win value,"" without explicit mention of calculating or comparing mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived safety of the higher probability of winning and the attractiveness of the win value, not explicitly on the comparison of mean differences.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities. The individual's focus is more on the perceived safety and attractiveness of the win rather than a calculated comparison of expected values or mean differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not reflect a consideration of mean differences or an explicit comparison based on the decision reason's rule. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does consider probabilities and outcomes in their decision-making process, albeit in a manner that does not directly align with the specified decision reason."
6,"-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there are no sure outcomes in the decision problem, the reference value is zero. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of the lotteries (6000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, 3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B) and their respective probabilities (0.1% and 99.9% for Lottery A, 0.2% and 99.8% for Lottery B). The differences between the outcomes and the reference value (zero) are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, and 3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B. The mean difference for Lottery A is (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros, and for Lottery B is (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and the height of the prize money in case of a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the height of the prize money, considering that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also beat a 0.1% chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate mean differences, while the individual focuses on the height of the prize money and the low probabilities without explicitly calculating or comparing mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, but in this case, both lotteries have the same mean difference (6 Euros). The individual's justification is based on the height of the prize money, which aligns with preferring a higher outcome but does not directly reflect the decision reason's calculation of mean differences considering probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the height of the prize money and the low probabilities of winning does not directly align with the decision reason's calculation of mean differences considering probabilities. While the individual's decision might coincidentally align with a preference for a higher outcome, the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing mean differences as described by the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, the reference value is -3000 Euros, as Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The decision reason calculates the differences between the outcomes and the reference value, weighted by their probabilities, to determine the preferred lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, focusing on the potential losses and the realism of the probabilities. They compared the potential loss of Lottery A (-4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability) to the certain loss of Lottery B (-3000 Euros). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aimed to minimize the ""realistically probable loss."" They acknowledged that Lottery A had a chance to result in no loss but deemed the 20% probability too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000 Euros compared to the certain loss of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries, which aligns with the information needed for the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically focuses on the differences between the outcomes and a reference value (in this case, -3000 Euros), considering their probabilities. The individual's focus was more on minimizing the ""realistically probable loss"" rather than explicitly calculating mean differences from a reference point.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities. The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating mean differences, does weigh the potential losses against their probabilities, suggesting a similar concern for the expected outcome but framed as minimizing probable loss rather than maximizing favorable differences from a reference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60

This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision-making process shares some similarities with the decision reason (considering outcomes and their probabilities), it does not perfectly align with the specific rule of the decision reason (calculating mean differences from a reference value and choosing based on that). The individual's focus on minimizing ""realistically probable loss"" suggests an intuitive consideration of expected outcomes but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes and their probabilities, as well as a reference value. Since neither lottery offers a sure outcome, the reference value is zero. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes (-4000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery A, -3000 Euros and 0 Euros for Lottery B) and their probabilities (20% and 80% for Lottery A, 25% and 75% for Lottery B). The mean differences for Lottery A are (-4000 - 0) * 0.2 = -800 and (0 - 0) * 0.8 = 0. For Lottery B, the mean differences are (-3000 - 0) * 0.25 = -750 and (0 - 0) * 0.75 = 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its less negative mean difference (-750 vs. -800).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses, indicating that the risk of a larger loss was a significant factor in their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that they were not willing to risk a larger loss to reduce the chance of a loss by 5 percentage points, and that they weigh loss amounts higher than gain amounts. This suggests that the individual's decision was influenced by the potential losses and their relative weights.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which is Lottery B. The individual's justification emphasizes avoiding a larger loss, which also points towards preferring Lottery B due to its smaller loss amount (-3000 Euros vs. -4000 Euros), even though the individual mentions the 5 percentage point difference in probabilities. The individual's emphasis on loss aversion and the specific mention of not wanting to risk a larger loss to gain a 5% reduction in risk aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the less negative mean difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high degree of certainty that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report aligns closely with the considerations and preferences outlined in the decision reason, particularly in terms of focusing on potential losses and their probabilities. However, it is not a perfect match since the individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences, which is the core of the decision reason. Nonetheless, the emphasis on loss aversion and the risk of larger losses strongly suggests that the individual's decision process was consistent with the principles of the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. Since there are no sure outcomes in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The reason calculates the mean difference by considering the differences between the outcomes and this reference value, weighted by their probabilities. For Lottery A, the calculation involves -3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability. For Lottery B, it involves -6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A is (-3000 * 0.9 + 0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, it is (-6000 * 0.45 + 0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options and the reduction of the loss probability from 90% to 45%. They weighed the attractiveness of lowering the probability of a loss against the increased potential loss amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the ""sichere Route"" (safer route), implying they preferred to avoid the potential for a higher loss of 6000 Euros, despite the lower probability of this loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean differences between the outcomes and a reference value, considering their probabilities. The individual, however, focused on the absolute loss amounts and the probabilities of these losses, rather than explicitly calculating or mentioning mean differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding the higher potential loss, which aligns with a risk-averse approach but does not explicitly mention comparing mean differences or using the reference value as described in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and the reference value. While the individual considers probabilities and outcomes, their justification is more closely related to risk aversion and avoiding high losses rather than explicitly calculating or comparing mean differences as the decision reason would suggest. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used the decision reason as described to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating a preference based on the mean difference between outcomes and a reference value. The reference value in this case is 0 since there are no sure outcomes in the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcome is -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. Both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome with high probabilities (99.9% and 99.8%, respectively). The decision reason calculates the mean difference by considering these outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that 0.1% and 0.2% are approximately equally irrelevant in a single run, indicating they consider the probabilities of the outcomes. The individual's focus is on minimizing the penalty in a theoretical worst-case scenario.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aimed to minimize the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in a theoretical worst-case scenario, implying they were looking to minimize loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires consideration of the outcomes and their probabilities to calculate mean differences. The individual considered the probabilities but focused more on the worst-case scenario (minimizing loss), which aligns with considering outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using probabilities to weigh these differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the probabilities. The individual's justification is about minimizing the penalty in the worst case, which could be interpreted as preferring the lottery with the less severe outcome in case of loss, without explicit mention of weighing these by their probabilities or calculating mean differences.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's focus on minimizing loss in the worst-case scenario aligns with considering the outcomes but does not fully align with the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing mean differences based on probabilities. The individual's approach seems more simplistic, focusing on the worst-case outcome rather than a probabilistically weighted average.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there are some elements of the decision reason present in the individual's thought process (consideration of outcomes), the explicit calculation and comparison of mean differences based on probabilities, as required by the decision reason, are not clearly evident in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as defined, but there is a slight alignment in the concern for outcomes."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied to this problem because it considers the outcomes and their probabilities. The reference value for this decision problem is 500 Euros, which is the value of the sure outcome of Lottery B. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are:
- For Lottery A: (1000 - 500) = 500 Euros with 50% probability and (0 - 500) = -500 Euros with 50% probability.
- For Lottery B: (500 - 500) = 0 Euros with 100% probability.
The mean difference for Lottery A is (500 * 0.5) + (-500 * 0.5) = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical value of both options and their current situation regarding additional rewards. They seemed to weigh the certainty of increasing their winnings against the potential for maximizing their gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by prioritizing the certainty of increasing their winnings over the potential for an additional gain, indicating a preference for a sure outcome in the context of their current situation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value. The individual considered the mathematical value of both options but did not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or comparing them directly. However, their focus on certainty and increasing their winnings suggests an implicit consideration of the value of sure outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference. The individual's justification emphasizes the importance of ensuring an increase in their winnings, which aligns with preferring a sure outcome (Lottery B) over a gamble (Lottery A), especially considering the reference value (500 Euros from Lottery B).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60

This assessment indicates that while the individual's reasoning and the decision reason share some similarities, such as considering the value of sure outcomes, the individual's justification does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences based on probabilities. The individual's emphasis on certainty and ensuring an increase in winnings suggests some alignment with the decision reason's preference for favorable outcomes but does not directly mirror the calculation-based approach of the decision reason. Therefore, the assessment is above the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason being used but with significant uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -500 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, the reference value is -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the reference value are considered important. For Lottery A, the differences are -1000 - (-500) = -500 (with 50% probability) and 0 - (-500) = 500 (with 50% probability). For Lottery B, the difference is -500 - (-500) = 0 (with 100% probability). The mean difference for Lottery A is (-500 * 0.5 + 500 * 0.5) = 0, and for Lottery B, it is 0. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that ""50% sind immernoch eine relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis"" which translates to ""50% is still a relevant chance of an outcome."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of the outcome in Lottery A. The individual then states they decided to ""den absoluten möglichen Verlustwert zu minimieren"" which translates to ""minimize the absolute possible loss value."" This suggests the individual focused on minimizing the worst-case scenario or the maximum potential loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on minimizing the absolute possible loss value, which implies they were considering the worst-case outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences from a reference value, considering the probabilities of these differences. The individual considered the probability of the outcome in Lottery A and aimed to minimize the absolute loss, which aligns with considering the worst-case scenario but does not directly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, while the individual aimed to minimize the absolute possible loss. The decision reason's rule is more about the average expected difference from a reference point, whereas the individual's approach seems more focused on avoiding the worst-case loss.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean differences from a reference value based on probabilities. The individual's focus was on minimizing the absolute loss, which is a simpler and more straightforward approach than calculating mean differences from a reference value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification and considerations do not closely match the decision reason's process of calculating and comparing mean differences from a reference value. However, it is not a 0 because the individual does consider the concept of minimizing loss, which is somewhat related to the idea of comparing outcomes, albeit in a much simpler manner."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences from a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome if present, or zero otherwise. In this case, since there's no sure outcome (100% probability of a specific amount) in either lottery, the reference value is zero. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries:
- Lottery A: 6000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 75% probability.
- Lottery B: 4000 Euros with 25% probability, 2000 Euros with 25% probability, 0 Euros with 50% probability.
The differences from the reference value (0 Euros) are 6000 Euros, 4000 Euros, and 2000 Euros for the non-zero outcomes. The mean difference for each lottery can be calculated by multiplying each difference by its probability and summing these products.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual considered the amounts of money in each lottery and noted that all non-zero amounts were four-digit, implying they were considered significant. The individual focused on the probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual based their decision on which option gave them the greater probability of winning a large amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, while the individual focused on the probability of winning a large amount without explicitly mentioning calculations of mean differences or considering the specific probabilities of each outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities, whereas the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning a large amount without explicit consideration of the mean differences or the specific probabilities of each non-zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of winning a large amount and their implicit consideration of the magnitude of the outcomes align somewhat with the decision reason's emphasis on differences from a reference value. However, the decision reason's specific calculation of mean differences and consideration of all outcomes' probabilities do not explicitly match the individual's justification. The verbal report does not clearly indicate that the individual performed or considered the calculations central to the decision reason, suggesting that while there might be some superficial alignment, the detailed process of the decision reason was not followed. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but there is some slight possibility of alignment in the general consideration of outcome magnitudes and probabilities."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities, calculating the mean difference from a reference value. Since both lotteries (A and B) have outcomes with associated probabilities, and there's no sure outcome (100% probability) in either lottery, the reference value is 0. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes and their probabilities for both lotteries. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 25% probability, -2000 Euros with 25% probability, and 0 Euros with 50% probability. The mean difference for each lottery from the reference value (0) can be calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the differences in the probabilities of not losing anything. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized minimizing the chance of losing, considering a 25 percentage point higher chance of not losing as more important than reducing the loss amount in the unlikely event of a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their probabilities) with that considered by the individual (high risk of losses, probabilities of not losing), there's a partial match. The individual focused on the risk of losses and the probability of not losing, which aligns with considering outcomes and their probabilities but doesn't explicitly mention calculating mean differences.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities) to the individual’s justification (prioritizing the chance of not losing over the amount of loss), there's a conceptual alignment in prioritizing outcomes based on their probabilities, but the individual's justification doesn't explicitly mention calculating or comparing mean differences.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's focus on minimizing loss and considering probabilities somewhat aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on outcomes and their probabilities, the explicit calculation and comparison of mean differences as per the decision reason are not clearly described in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 5 Euros with 100% probability, which becomes the reference value. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros with 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with 99.9% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros with 100% probability. The mean difference for Lottery A considering the reference value (5 Euros) would be calculated as (5000-5)*0.1% + (0-5)*99.9%, and for Lottery B, it would simply be (5-5)*100% = 0, since it is the reference point itself. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of 0.1% as ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant) and expresses a preference for a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities and the nature of the outcomes (guaranteed vs. uncertain).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring a guaranteed small gain (Lottery B) over the small chance of a large gain (Lottery A), indicating a risk-averse approach and a focus on the certainty of the outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities relative to a reference value. The individual, while not explicitly calculating mean differences, considers the probabilities and the nature of the outcomes, which aligns with the type of information the decision reason would consider.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, which, in this case, would likely favor Lottery B due to its certainty and the calculation involving the reference value. The individual's justification also favors Lottery B due to its guaranteed outcome, suggesting an alignment with the decision reason's preference for more favorable (in this context, more certain) outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the guaranteed outcome and the preference for certainty over a small chance of a large gain aligns with the decision reason's focus on mean differences and the preference for more favorable outcomes based on a reference value. While the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention mean differences, their justification reflects a similar risk-averse logic that prioritizes certainty, suggesting a high likelihood that the decision reason was used. However, the lack of explicit calculation or mention of the reference value and mean differences introduces some uncertainty, preventing a 100% certainty assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value, which is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome, or otherwise zero. In this case, Lottery B offers a sure outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability, making the reference value -5 Euros. The outcomes and their probabilities for each lottery are as follows:
- Lottery A: -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability, 0 Euros with 99.9% probability
- Lottery B: -5 Euros with 100% probability
The mean difference for Lottery A from the reference value (-5 Euros) can be calculated as: ((-5000 - (-5)) * 0.001) + ((0 - (-5)) * 0.999) = (-4995 * 0.001) + (5 * 0.999) = -4.995 + 4.995 = 0
The mean difference for Lottery B from the reference value is 0 since it is the reference itself.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the calculation of mean differences considering the probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual initially considered the loss amount in Lottery A as extremely unattractive, which drew them to Option B. However, they then looked at the probability distribution in Lottery A, noting the 0.1% chance of a significant loss is so small that the risk is negligible, making a loss of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by stating that, given the negligible risk (0.1% chance of losing 5000 Euros), the effective outcome is a guaranteed 0 Euros, which they found more favorable than the sure loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating mean differences based on outcomes and their probabilities, using a reference value derived from a sure outcome if available. The individual considered the probability of the significant loss in Lottery A as negligible, effectively focusing on the practical guarantee of 0 Euros, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities but does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences or using a reference value.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities. The individual preferred Lottery A because the risk of the significant loss was considered negligible, making the effective outcome more favorable than the sure loss in Lottery B. While the individual's reasoning about negligible risk and effective outcomes aligns with the concept of considering probabilities, it does not directly reflect the calculation of mean differences as outlined in the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of calculating and comparing mean differences based on a reference value. However, the individual's focus on the negligible risk and the effective outcome does reflect an intuitive understanding of probability's impact on expected outcomes, which is somewhat aligned with the spirit of the decision reason but not its specific application.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are elements of the individual's reasoning that align with considering probabilities and outcomes, the explicit application of the decision reason's rule regarding mean differences and a reference value is not clearly evident in the verbal report."
17,"FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. The reference value is the value of a sure outcome with 100% probability if the decision problem contains a sure outcome or otherwise zero. In this case, the reference value is 1500 Euros, which is the sure outcome of Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the outcomes of each lottery and their probabilities: 
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros with 50% probability, -3000 Euros with 50% probability
- Lottery B: 1500 Euros with 100% probability
The mean difference for Lottery A can be calculated as (3000 - 1500) * 0.5 + (-3000 - 1500) * 0.5 = -1500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is (1500 - 1500) = 0 Euros. However, considering the rule of the decision reason, we should calculate the mean difference as the sum of the products of the differences between each outcome and the reference value (1500 Euros) and their probabilities. For Lottery A: (3000-1500)*0.5 + (-3000-1500)*0.5 = 1500*0.5 - 4500*0.5 = -1500. For Lottery B, since the outcome is the reference value, the mean difference is 0.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries, specifically mentioning the equal chances of winning or losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A and the guaranteed 1500 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by comparing the expected (or middle) gain of both lotteries over numerous attempts, noting that Lottery A would result in a mean gain of 0 Euros, while Lottery B guarantees a gain of 1500 Euros, making the decision clear due to the 100% chance of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries, which aligns with the information required by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering the differences' probabilities. The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the expected gains (mean outcomes) of both lotteries, which indirectly reflects the consideration of mean differences from a reference point (in this case, implicitly 0 Euros for Lottery A's calculation and explicitly the guaranteed amount for Lottery B). However, the individual's explanation focuses on the expected value of each lottery rather than explicitly calculating and comparing mean differences from a reference value as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's decision-making process, as described, aligns closely with the principles of considering outcomes and their probabilities, and the preference for a guaranteed gain over a risky option with a potentially higher but also potentially negative outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating mean differences from a reference value as defined by the decision reason, which introduces some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was applied exactly as defined. Nonetheless, the underlying logic of preferring a sure gain over a risky option with an expected value of 0 Euros suggests a strong alignment with the decision reason's principles."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because the relevant information, namely the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries, is available. The reference value for this decision problem is 2000 Euros, which is the sure outcome of Lottery A with 100% probability. The differences between the outcomes of Lottery B and the reference value are (3000-2000) = 1000 Euros with 50% probability and (-3000-2000) = -5000 Euros with 50% probability. For Lottery A, the difference is (2000-2000) = 0 Euros with 100% probability. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the similarity between the current decision problem and a previous one, with the secure option now being more attractive (2000 Euros instead of 1500 Euros). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is not explicitly stated in terms of specific calculations or comparisons of outcomes, but it is mentioned that ""Die Entscheidung war selbstverständlich"" which translates to ""The decision was obvious."" This implies that the choice seemed clear to the individual, possibly due to the attractiveness of the sure option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes, probabilities, and their differences from a reference value) with that considered by the individual, it seems the individual was aware of the general structure of the decision problem (comparing a risky option to a sure gain) but did not explicitly mention calculating or considering the mean differences as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the differences' probabilities) to the individual's justification, there's no direct mention of calculating mean differences or their probabilities. However, the individual's emphasis on the attractiveness of the sure option and the obviousness of the decision could imply an intuitive understanding or preference for the sure gain over the risk, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the sure outcome when its value is high enough.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention the calculations or considerations outlined in the decision reason, their emphasis on the attractiveness of the sure option and the obviousness of the decision suggests an alignment with the decision reason's general preference for the sure outcome when it is favorable. However, the lack of explicit mention of mean differences and their probabilities introduces uncertainty, preventing a higher assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, the reference value is the sure outcome of Lottery B, which is 1000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. The mean of Lottery A is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. The decision reason calculates the differences between the outcomes and the reference value and considers their probabilities. For Lottery A, the differences from the reference value (1000 Euros) are 3000 - 1000 = 2000 Euros and -3000 - 1000 = -4000 Euros, each with 50% probability. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 since it is the reference value itself. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering these probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros from Lottery B and compares it to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A, acknowledging that while 1000 Euros is significantly less than the potential gain from Lottery A, it is more than the expected value of Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because the guaranteed 1000 Euros is more than the expected value (mean) of Lottery A, implying a preference for the certainty of a positive outcome over the potential for a higher gain that is balanced by an equal potential for a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the mean differences from a reference value and considering their probabilities. The individual discusses the expected value (mean) of Lottery A in relation to the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B, which aligns with considering the mean differences, though the individual does not explicitly calculate or mention probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference, considering probabilities. The individual prefers Lottery B because its guaranteed outcome is better than the mean of Lottery A, which suggests a consideration of the mean outcomes but does not explicitly address the calculation of mean differences from a reference value as described in the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report aligns with key aspects of the decision reason, such as considering the mean outcomes and preferring a sure gain over a risky option with a lower mean. However, the explicit calculation and consideration of probabilities and differences from a reference value as outlined in the decision reason are not clearly detailed in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and a reference value. In this case, Lottery A offers 0 Euros with 100% probability, which serves as the reference value since it is a sure outcome. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The mean difference for Lottery B, considering the reference value of 0 Euros, would be calculated as (6000*0.5 + (-6000)*0.5) = 0. This indicates that, on average, Lottery B offers no gain or loss compared to the reference value. However, the reason emphasizes the differences between outcomes and the reference value, which are crucial for determining preference. Since Lottery A has no risk and offers a sure outcome of 0 Euros, and Lottery B involves risk with potential significant gain or loss, the decision reason can indeed be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that one of the options (Lottery A) was not a lottery but a sure outcome and focused on whether it was worth taking the risk associated with the other option (Lottery B), especially considering the potential loss of 6000 Euros.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by excluding Lottery B as soon as they saw the potential for a significant loss (6000 Euros), stating that the probabilities became irrelevant at that point. This implies the individual's decision was heavily influenced by the potential downside risk of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason considers the differences between outcomes and a reference value, emphasizing the importance of these differences and their probabilities. The individual focused on the risk of significant loss in Lottery B and the sure outcome of Lottery A, which aligns with considering the differences between outcomes and a reference point (the sure outcome of 0 Euros from Lottery A).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable mean difference considering the probabilities of these differences. The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating mean differences, shows a preference for avoiding the risk of a significant loss, which can be interpreted as preferring the sure outcome (Lottery A) over the risky one (Lottery B) due to its more favorable (or at least, less unfavorable) outcome profile given their considerations.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process shares elements with the decision reason, particularly in considering the potential outcomes and their implications (though the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities in their final decision-making step). However, the individual's emphasis on avoiding loss and their disregard for probabilities once the potential loss was identified suggests a slightly different focus than the decision reason's explicit consideration of mean differences and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision process aligns with some aspects of the decision reason, such as considering outcomes and their implications, it does not fully match the reason's emphasis on mean differences and their probabilities. The individual's focus on avoiding significant loss and their approach to disregarding probabilities after identifying a potential downside risk introduces elements not explicitly covered by the decision reason. Thus, it's somewhat likely but not certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."
