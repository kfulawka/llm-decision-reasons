STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 100% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 33% chance of the maximum outcome (2500 Euros)
- Lottery B: 100% chance of the maximum outcome (2400 Euros)
This information is summarized as the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B (2400 Euros) and the potential higher outcome of Lottery A (2500 Euros) along with its associated risks, including the possibility of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the guaranteed 2400 Euros was too good to pass up, considering the additional potential 100 Euros from Lottery A was not worth the risk of possibly getting nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 33% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. However, the individual's consideration was more about the guaranteed amount versus the potential higher amount and the risk of getting nothing, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (33% for 2500 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the guarantee and risk aversion, not directly referencing the probability of the maximum outcome as the deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification is based more on the guarantee of Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros with a 33% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros with a 34% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum outcomes (33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that both lotteries have winning probabilities that, when rounded, seem similar (1/3), and they focus on the difference in the likelihood of the higher gain, implying they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses the ""leicht unwahrscheinlicheren höheren Gewinn,"" which translates to the ""slightly less probable higher gain,"" indicating they preferred the option with the higher outcome that is less likely, because the potential loss difference is minimal, and they are willing to ""gamble"" in this context.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the ""leicht unwahrscheinlicheren höheren Gewinn.""
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification suggests they chose the option with the higher outcome that has a slightly lower probability (Lottery A's 33% vs. Lottery B's 34% for the maximum outcomes), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's verbal report indicates that they considered the probabilities of the higher outcomes of both lotteries and chose based on the preference for the slightly less probable higher gain, which directly aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. Thus, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 80%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the certain outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros) and compared it to the uncertain outcomes of Lottery B (4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that they prefer the certain 3000 Euros over the possibility of getting nothing in Lottery B, even though the best outcome in Lottery B is only 1000 Euros more than the certain outcome in Lottery A.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual. The individual focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the uncertainty of outcomes in Lottery B but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. However, their justification implies a consideration of the risk associated with the higher maximum outcome in Lottery B. Next, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification, it seems the individual's choice aligns with preferring the certain outcome (which can be interpreted as preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome, since 100% is a higher probability than 80% in this context, but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The report focuses more on the certainty of the outcome and the potential loss in Lottery B rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, while the choice might coincidentally align with what the decision reason would suggest, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of this specific decision reason."
4,"Box B hätte gewinnen können. Gerade da ja am Ende auch nur ein Experiment zufällig ausgewählt wird für mich.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 25%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a probability of 20%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the probability of winning more than 0 Euros in each lottery. They mention that Lottery A had a higher probability of winning more than 0 Euros, which was more important to them than the potential 1000 Euros more they could have won in Lottery B. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the comparison of the probabilities of winning a positive amount in each lottery, rather than the specific maximum outcomes or their probabilities.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery, whereas the individual considered the probability of winning any positive amount. These are not exactly the same, as the individual's consideration encompasses any outcome greater than 0 Euros, not just the maximum outcome. Next, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the higher probability of winning any positive amount), it appears that the individual's reasoning does not align with the decision reason. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a lower probability (20%) of its maximum outcome compared to Lottery A's probability (25%) of its maximum outcome, but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 45% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of money (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros), the probability of winning (90% for Lottery A, less than 50% for Lottery B), and the concept of a ""fast sicherer kleineren Gewinn"" (a nearly certain smaller win).
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a relatively secure (90% probability) smaller win, preferring this over the chance of a larger win with a lower probability (less than 50%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (amounts, probabilities, and the concept of a secure win). The individual did consider the probabilities, which aligns with the decision reason's focus, but the primary focus of the decision reason (the probability of the maximum outcome) is not explicitly mentioned as the deciding factor in the verbal report.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring a secure smaller win due to its higher probability). The decision reason would actually suggest preferring Lottery B (since 45% is less than 90%), which contradicts the individual's choice based on the verbal report. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion or a preference for certainty rather than the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. Instead, the individual's choice seems to be driven by a preference for a more certain outcome, which is opposite to what the decision reason would suggest in this scenario. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. Since we can derive the probabilities of the maximum outcomes from the given lotteries, the decision reason can be applied. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 0.2% chance of 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 0.1% chance of 6000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the winning probabilities are very low in both cases, implying they considered the probabilities of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to ""challenge fate"" and chooses the option that, in the unlikely event of winning, offers the higher amount (6000 Euros), implying they are focusing on the potential maximum gain in the face of very low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the low winning probabilities but does not directly match their focus on the maximum potential gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (which would be Lottery B with a 0.1% chance of 6000 Euros), and the individual chooses Lottery B but justifies it based on the potential for a higher maximum gain, not explicitly because of the lower probability of the maximum outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's outcome (preferring Lottery B) but the justification provided in the verbal report does not explicitly match the decision reason's rule (focusing on the lower probability of the maximum outcome). The individual seems more focused on the potential maximum gain in the face of low probabilities rather than the probability of achieving that maximum outcome itself.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The justification provided leans more towards the appeal of the higher potential gain rather than the comparative probabilities of achieving the maximum outcomes."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome (0 Euros, or not losing anything) has a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of minimizing loss (since both outcomes are losses) is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of loss in Lottery B versus the possibility of not losing anything in Lottery A, despite the potential for a greater loss. They weigh the 100% chance of losing in Lottery B against the mixed outcome of Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by stating they would not choose an option with a 100% chance of loss if the alternative allows for a chance, however small, of not losing anything, even if the potential loss is greater.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual discusses the appeal of avoiding a certain loss and having a chance at no loss, which aligns with considering the probabilities of outcomes but does not directly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason dictates.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a chance of no loss, which can be interpreted as focusing on the existence of a better outcome rather than directly comparing the probabilities of these outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning is more aligned with avoiding certain loss and valuing the chance of no loss rather than directly applying the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. However, the individual's focus on the possibility of not losing anything (which is the maximum outcome in terms of preference) in Lottery A over the certain loss in Lottery B does reflect an consideration of the probability of achieving the best possible outcome, albeit not in the precise manner described by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while the individual's reasoning touches upon aspects related to the decision reason (such as considering the probability of achieving a preferred outcome), it does not directly apply the rule as stated by the decision reason. The individual's justification is more about avoiding certain loss and valuing any chance of no loss, rather than a straightforward application of preferring the lower probability of the maximum outcome. Thus, it's uncertain but leans towards not using the decision reason as the primary basis for the choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with an 80% probability, and for Lottery B, it's also 0 Euros with a 75% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery, which is 80% for Lottery A and 75% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losses being close to each other and chose the option with the lesser loss.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the similarity in loss probabilities and the choice of the lesser loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcome, which is 0 Euros for both lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losses and the amount of loss). The individual focused on the loss aspect rather than the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (chose based on the lesser loss because the probabilities of losses are similar). The decision reason and the individual’s justification do not align because the decision reason is about the probability of the maximum outcome (which is not a loss in this context), and the individual's decision is based on minimizing loss given similar loss probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The decision reason provided focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), which does not align with the individual's reasoning that is based on minimizing losses when the probabilities of those losses are similar. Thus, it's clear that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 90%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 45%. 
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing and the probabilities associated with each lottery, mentioning that with Lottery B, there's ""fast sicher"" (almost certain) a loss, but this seems to be a misunderstanding since the actual concern is the probability of losing a certain amount. The individual seems to focus on the probability of losing and the amount of potential loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because, despite the potential for a higher loss, the probability of losing is lower than 50% (actually referring to the probability of losing in Lottery B being higher than in A, but misinterpreting the probabilities).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 90% for Lottery A and 45% for Lottery B. The individual, however, seems to misunderstand the probabilities and focuses on the general risk of losing and the amounts, rather than specifically comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (45% probability of the maximum outcome). The individual's justification, however, seems to prioritize the lower risk of losing any amount, which aligns with choosing Lottery A due to its lower probability of losing (10% chance of losing 0 Euros, implying a 90% chance of the maximum loss, but the individual's reasoning is not clearly aligned with the decision reason's rule).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome and its rule for preference. The individual's misunderstanding of the probabilities and focus on different aspects of the lotteries indicate that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."
10,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome (or in this case, the minimum outcome since both lotteries involve losses) of each lottery and prefers the one with the lower probability of this outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum loss is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the maximum loss is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the maximum losses (0.2% for Lottery A and 0.1% for Lottery B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of losing money in both lotteries and the fact that the only other outcome is 0 Euros, with no possibility of winning a positive amount. They also compared the potential losses and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would lose less in the worst-case scenario, considering the difference in probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) as negligible because both outcomes are very unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did consider the probabilities of the losses and the amounts, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome (or in this case, the maximum loss), which would be Lottery B with a 0.1% probability of losing -6000 Euros. However, the individual's justification is based on preferring the lottery with the smaller loss amount when considering the worst-case scenario, not strictly on the probability of the maximum loss. The individual does mention considering the probabilities but decides based on the amount of loss, treating the probability difference as negligible.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision process involves considering the elements relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and outcomes), but their justification for the choice (focusing on the amount of potential loss and treating probability differences as negligible) does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum loss). Therefore, while there's some alignment, the individual's decision-making process does not closely match the decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 50% probability. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 500 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 1000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions both lotteries and their respective outcomes (500€ and 1000€) and seems to consider the disappointment of receiving 0€.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chooses the ""sicheren 500€"" (the safe 500 Euros), implying a preference for certainty over the risk of getting 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is explicitly given for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration is more about the certainty of the outcome and the potential disappointment, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (50% chance of 1000 Euros). However, the individual chooses Lottery A, citing the desire for certainty, not directly aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the desire for certainty and avoiding disappointment, rather than comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as per the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
12,"auch kein Glücksspiel betreiben, wenn ich dann einen sicheren Verlust ohne zu gambeln wählen würde.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 50%, and for Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros, but since it's the only outcome, its probability is 100%. However, to apply the decision reason correctly, we need to identify the maximum outcome in the context of the decision reason, which seems to focus on the best possible outcome. For Lottery A, the ""maximum"" outcome in the context of avoiding loss is indeed 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcome is consistently -500 Euros, which is not a ""maximum"" in the sense of being desirable but is the only outcome. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the best outcome (0 Euros for A and no positive outcome for B, but considering B's single outcome as its ""maximum"" for the sake of comparison). The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower probability (50%) of its ""best"" outcome compared to Lottery B, which has a 100% probability of its only outcome (-500 Euros), but since B's outcome is not a ""maximum"" in the desirable sense, the application might be nuanced.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the concept of certain loss (100% Verluste) and compares it with potential higher losses in an alternative, indicating a consideration of the magnitude of potential losses and the concept of certainty versus uncertainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating they would only accept a certain loss if the alternative had a significantly higher potential loss (e.g., 4000 Euros), suggesting a risk-averse approach where certain losses are only acceptable if the potential downside of the alternative is substantially worse.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual considers the magnitude of potential losses and the concept of certainty. The individual's focus is more on the absolute values of losses and the certainty of loss rather than the probability of the ""best"" outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery A due to its 50% chance of the ""best"" outcome (0 Euros). The individual's justification, however, is based on comparing the certainty of loss in one option against the potential for a much larger loss in the other, not directly on the probabilities of the best outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual's justification is centered around the acceptance of certain losses in comparison to potential larger losses in an alternative, without considering the probabilities of the best outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome (6000 Euros) with 25% probability.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome (4000 Euros) with 25% probability.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual seems to focus on the aspect that in both lotteries, they can only win money (or not lose, considering 0 Euros as not a loss but a form of gain). They mention choosing the box that pays out more than 0 Euros, implying they consider the positive outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by selecting the option that offers a payout over 0 Euros, without explicitly discussing probabilities or the maximum outcomes in terms of their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for consideration.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on gaining more than 0 Euros, without reference to the probability of the maximum outcome.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome (which in this context means the most negative outcome since all outcomes are losses) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is also -4000 Euros (since -4000 Euros is the most negative outcome mentioned, despite the report focusing on ""Verlusten,"" implying losses, we identify the most significant loss as the basis for comparison), with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most negative outcomes in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of losses and the intuition (""Bauchgefühl"") that a smaller loss might be preferable, even if it makes the overall loss more probable. They were significantly influenced by the magnitude of the potential loss of 6000 Euros.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the desire to avoid the higher loss of 6000 Euros, indicating that the magnitude of the loss and its potential impact played a crucial role in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the maximum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (magnitude of losses, intuition about smaller losses, and the impact of the largest loss). The individual focused on the magnitude of the loss rather than the probability of the maximum outcome, which is the core of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding the higher loss due to its magnitude and potential impact). The individual's justification does not directly address the probability of the maximum outcomes but rather the magnitude of the losses and the psychological impact of the largest loss.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process was more influenced by the magnitude of the potential losses and the psychological impact of those losses rather than the probability of the maximum outcome as specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5 Euros with a 100% probability.
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 100% chance of 5 Euros
- Lottery B: 0.1% chance of 5000 Euros
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the amount of 5 Euros as very low, comparable to the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery B, implying they are focusing on the magnitudes of the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies choosing Lottery B over the certain 5 Euros from Lottery A because they prefer trying their luck at getting a significant amount of money, even though it's less likely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual discusses the outcomes and their attractiveness but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual prefers Lottery B, which has a lower probability of its maximum outcome (0.1% for 5000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (100% for 5 Euros), aligning with the decision reason's rule. However, the individual's justification seems more focused on the potential for a significant gain rather than explicitly stating a preference for lower probability outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention using this rule as the basis for the decision. The justification provided focuses more on the potential for a significant gain and the perceived value of the guaranteed amount, rather than directly on the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not clear that the decision reason was the primary basis for the choice, leading to an assessment that is more than uncertain (50) but not certain (100)."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome in terms of the least negative (or the ""best"" in this context of losses) is 0 Euros, but since the decision reason focuses on the ""maximum outcome"" and both lotteries offer losses, we interpret this as considering the least negative outcome or the outcome that is not a loss. However, given the context, it seems the decision reason is about avoiding the worst-case scenario with the highest probability. Thus, for Lottery B, the focus might actually be on the -5000 Euros loss with a 0.1% probability, as this is the ""maximum"" loss. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities of the worst outcomes: 100% for -5 Euros in Lottery A and 0.1% for -5000 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions avoiding a 100% loss probability and considers the alternative where much more loss could occur but is very unlikely. This suggests the individual is considering the probabilities and outcomes of losses in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on a principle of avoiding certain loss when the alternative, although potentially leading to a much greater loss, has a very low probability of occurring.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum (worst) outcome, which aligns with the individual considering the 100% loss probability and the very low probability of a significant loss in the other lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum (worst) outcome, which aligns with the individual’s preference for avoiding a certain loss in favor of an option with a very low probability of a worse outcome.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described in the verbal report aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the worst outcomes and the preference for the option with the lower probability of the maximum loss, even though the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes in the exact manner described by the decision reason. However, the essence of avoiding certain loss for a potentially worse but much less likely outcome matches the spirit of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 1500 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the attractiveness of a guaranteed amount over 1000 Euros, especially when the alternative (Lottery A) offers a 50% chance of doubling that amount and a 50% chance of losing double that amount.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by highlighting the unattractiveness of the risk associated with Lottery A, specifically the 50% chance of losing a significant amount (3000 Euros), and the appeal of a guaranteed positive outcome (1500 Euros) from Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. However, the individual's consideration is more about the risk and the guarantee rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (50% chance of 3000 Euros). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the attractiveness of a guaranteed amount and the unattractiveness of the risk in Lottery A, not directly aligning with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of a guaranteed amount and the risk associated with the alternative, rather than comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 2000 Euros with 100% probability
- Lottery B: 3000 Euros with 50% probability
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the certain gain of 2000 Euros from Lottery A and compared it to the potential gain and loss of Lottery B, specifically mentioning the 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros and the potential to gain an additional 1000 Euros (implied as the difference between the 3000 Euros of Lottery B and the 2000 Euros of Lottery A) with a 50% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery A because they couldn't refuse a guaranteed 2000 Euros, especially when considering the risk of losing 3000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B, and only potentially gaining an additional 1000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the outcomes and their probabilities but focused more on the risk of loss and the guarantee of gain rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring Lottery A because it has a lower probability of its maximum outcome (which is actually 100% for Lottery A, making it the opposite of what the reason would prefer if applied correctly). Instead, the individual focused on the guarantee of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's focus on the guarantee of 2000 Euros and the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B does not reflect the application of the decision reason as described."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros with a probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is: 
- Lottery A: 100% probability of 1000 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% probability of 3000 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the certain gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery A and the risk of losing (or gaining) 3000 Euros from Lottery B with a relatively high probability (>30%). The individual prioritizes loss avoidance over potential gains.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the certain gain from Lottery A and the significant risk of loss from Lottery B, emphasizing the priority of avoiding losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the primary consideration. The individual focuses on the certainty of the gain and the risk of loss.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes avoiding losses and appreciates the certainty of a gain, which indirectly relates to the decision reason but does not directly address the probability of the maximum outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process seems to prioritize risk avoidance and certainty of gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the maximum outcome. However, the decision reason and the individual's justification share a common element in preferring a more secure option (lower probability of the maximum outcome could imply a less secure option due to its higher potential for loss or gain), but this is not explicitly about the probability of the maximum outcome as stated in the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there are some elements in the verbal report that suggest a preference for a more secure option, the decision reason's specific focus on the probability of the maximum outcome is not clearly reflected in the individual's justification or consideration process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the maximum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros with a 50% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the maximum outcome for each lottery: 100% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of a massive loss (6000 Euros with a probability >30%) in Lottery B and the certainty of 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to ""go safe"" due to the high risk of a significant loss in Lottery B, implying a preference for avoiding the risk of losing 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome, while the individual focuses on avoiding a significant loss, which indirectly relates to the probability of the negative outcome rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome. The individual's justification is about avoiding a significant loss, which aligns with preferring a certain outcome (0 Euros) over a risky one but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to prioritize risk avoidance rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests. However, the preference for the certain outcome (Lottery A) because of the high risk associated with Lottery B indirectly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the ""lower probability of the maximum outcome"" since the maximum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) has a 100% probability, and the focus is on avoiding the high-risk scenario of Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment indicates that while there's a slight alignment in the preference for avoiding the higher risk, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing the probabilities of the maximum outcomes to make the choice. The focus is more on risk avoidance than on the specific probabilities of the maximum outcomes."
