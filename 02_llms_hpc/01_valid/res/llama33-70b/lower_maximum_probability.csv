0,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to identify the maximum probability associated with each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (associated with the outcome of 2400 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (associated with the outcome of 2400 Euros). Since we can derive this information directly from the given probabilities, the decision reason can be applied in a strict manner.

Relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum probability = 66%
- Lottery B: Maximum probability = 100%

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower value of maximum probability. Comparing the maximum probabilities:
- Lottery A has a maximum probability of 66%.
- Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%.
Since 66% is less than 100%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
