STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%.

- Lottery A's probable outcomes: 2500 Euros with 33% probability, 2400 Euros with 66% probability. The 0 Euros outcome with 1% probability is not considered probable.
- Lottery B's probable outcome: 2400 Euros with 100% probability.

The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (2500*0.33 + 2400*0.66) / (0.33 + 0.66) = (825 + 1584) / 0.99 = 2410 Euros (approximately).
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is simply 2400 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's verbal report mentions looking at all the information and deciding on Lottery B because it has a guaranteed win. The information considered by the individual seems to include the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome. The justification for choosing Lottery B is its guaranteed win, implying a preference for certainty over potential higher rewards.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win of Lottery B), there seems to be a partial overlap in that both involve evaluating the outcomes of the lotteries, but the individual focuses on the guarantee rather than calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the guaranteed win), it appears the individual's decision is more aligned with a preference for certainty rather than explicitly calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria of calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes. However, the individual does consider the nature of the outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason. The focus on the guarantee rather than the average of probable outcomes suggests the decision reason was not the primary basis for the decision.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is lower than 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is lower than 50%. Thus, for both lotteries, only the 0 Euro outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is also 0 Euros. However, since the decision reason specifically looks at the average of probable outcomes and both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to consider how the reason would differentiate between them. Given that only the 0 Euro outcome is probable for both, the differentiation would likely come from the less probable outcomes indirectly, but the reason as stated focuses on probable outcomes. Therefore, based on the given information, the decision reason as stated would not differentiate between the two lotteries based on their probable outcomes since both have the same probable outcome (0 Euros) with probabilities above 50%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) and the potential gain. Specifically, they noted that Lottery B had a 1 percentage point lower probability of winning nothing compared to Lottery A and that the potential gain in Lottery B was 100 Euros higher than in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by comparing the probabilities of not winning and the potential winnings of the two lotteries, focusing on the slightly lower probability of not winning and the higher potential gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, as determined, would be 0 Euros for both lotteries. The individual, however, considered the difference in probabilities of not winning and the difference in potential gains, which is not directly aligned with the decision reason’s focus.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which, as calculated, does not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a probable outcome of 0 Euros. The individual’s justification, however, is based on a comparison of probabilities and potential gains, not directly on the average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%.
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has an 80% probability, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of 0 Euros has a 20% probability, which is lower than 50%, so it is not considered probable.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 100% probability, which is higher than 50%, making it a probable outcome. Since there is only one outcome in this case, it is the only probable outcome.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery A, it's 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the guaranteed win at B with the possible (4 out of 5) win at A, indicating they considered the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose B despite its lower guaranteed win compared to the possible win at A, suggesting they prioritized certainty over potential higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages. The individual considered the guaranteed win (which aligns with the concept of probable outcomes) but also mentioned the ""possible (4 out of 5) win,"" which indicates an understanding of probabilities but not necessarily a calculation of averages of probable outcomes as the decision reason dictates.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification seems to prioritize certainty (guaranteed win) over potential, which does not directly align with calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual considered probabilities and outcomes, there's no clear indication they calculated or compared the averages of probable outcomes as required by the decision reason. The verbal report suggests a focus on certainty versus potential gain rather than a direct application of the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, which is higher than 50%. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
The verbal report states ""Ansehen aller InfosZufallsauswahl, da beide Lotterien ziemlich ähnlich"", which translates to ""View all info, random selection, since both lotteries are quite similar"". 
The individual considered all the information and decided to make a random selection because the lotteries seemed similar to them. 
The justification for the choice is that the lotteries are similar, implying that the individual did not see a clear difference between the two options.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (all information, but with a focus on the similarity of the lotteries). The individual considered all the information but did not specifically mention probable outcomes or their averages.
Second, compare the decision reason's rule (prefer the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification for the choice (the lotteries are similar). The individual's justification does not match the decision reason's rule, as the individual did not discuss averages of probable outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, as the individual's focus was on the overall similarity of the lotteries rather than the specific calculation of probable outcomes and their averages.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. So, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. So, only the 3000 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is probable).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the size of the winnings and the probabilities of the lotteries, noting that Lottery B offers half the winnings of Lottery A but with double the probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the lower potential winnings, the higher probability of winning made it more appealing, especially since the decision is made only once.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities being higher than 50%. The individual considered the probabilities and the size of the winnings but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the specific 50% threshold.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning, which aligns with the decision reason’s preference for Lottery B (since its probable outcome of 3000 Euros is higher than Lottery A’s probable outcome of 0 Euros). However, the individual's reasoning was more about the balance between the size of the winnings and the probability rather than explicitly calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and the decision reason both prefer Lottery B, the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific calculation and criteria (focusing on outcomes with probabilities >50% and calculating their average) outlined in the decision reason. The individual's justification is more intuitive and based on the comparative probabilities and winnings, suggesting some alignment but not a direct application of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. However, since neither of the non-zero outcomes in Lottery A or Lottery B meets this criterion (0.1% and 0.2% are both less than 0.5), we need to adjust our understanding of the decision reason's applicability. Given the context, it seems the decision reason may not directly apply as intended because neither outcome meets the ""probable"" threshold as defined. However, the spirit of the reason might involve comparing expected values or considering the impact of the probabilities on the decision, even if the technical criteria for ""probable"" aren't met.

For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, and for Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%. Since neither outcome is technically ""probable"" by the reason's definition, but considering the essence of evaluating outcomes based on their probabilities and values, we proceed with understanding that the decision reason aims to compare lotteries based on their potential outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual mentions that in both cases, the probability of winning is low (1 in 1000 vs 2 in 1000), and they decided based on the possibility of a potentially double-higher win. This indicates the individual considered the probabilities and the potential winnings when making their decision.

First, the information considered by the individual includes the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and the potential amounts to be won. 
Second, the individual's justification for their choice is based on the comparison of the potential winnings, considering that one lottery offers a potentially double-higher win despite the low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities and outcomes of lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential winnings), we see that the individual did consider the key aspects that the decision reason is based on, albeit with a focus on the potential for higher winnings rather than strictly adhering to the ""probable outcomes"" definition.

Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (choosing based on the potential for a double-higher win), there's a conceptual alignment in that both involve evaluating the lotteries based on their potential outcomes and probabilities. However, the individual's approach is more straightforward, focusing on the maximum potential win given the low probabilities, rather than calculating an ""average of probable outcomes"" as the decision reason technically suggests.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision process aligns with considering the outcomes and their probabilities, it doesn't strictly follow the decision reason's criteria due to the misunderstanding or misapplication of the ""probable"" threshold. However, the essence of evaluating lotteries based on potential outcomes and their probabilities is present in the individual's decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered key aspects relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), their application and justification did not strictly align with the decision reason's technical criteria, indicating a partial but not complete use of the decision reason in their deliberation process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since 100% is greater than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery A has one probable outcome: -4000 Euros with 80% probability.
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: -3000 Euros with 100% probability.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is -4000 Euros (since only one outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be Lottery B because -3000 Euros is higher than -4000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that with Lottery A, there is at least a chance (1 out of 5, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the 20% chance of not losing anything) to not lose anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of the chance to not lose anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities, while the individual seems to focus on the chance of not losing anything, which does not directly align with calculating averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to choosing Lottery B due to its higher average probable outcome, but the individual chose Lottery A based on a different criterion (the chance of not losing anything).

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the possibility of avoiding loss rather than comparing the average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both Lottery A and Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is greater than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the outcome of -4000 Euros has a 20% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has an 80% probability, which is greater than 50%. Thus, only 0 Euros is considered a probable outcome for Lottery A.
- For Lottery B, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a 25% probability, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a 75% probability, which is greater than 50%. Thus, only 0 Euros is considered a probable outcome for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros since only the 0 Euro outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable in both cases.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the magnitude of the loss and its probability, noting that the loss in Lottery B is smaller but also somewhat more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, even though it is slightly more probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, would be the average of the 0 Euro outcomes for both lotteries, not directly considering the magnitude of losses or their exact probabilities unless they affect which outcomes are categorized as probable. The individual, however, considered the magnitude of the loss and its probability.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would not differentiate between them based on the provided probabilities and outcomes. The individual, however, chose based on the smaller loss being more preferable, even with a slightly higher probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's consideration of the loss magnitude and its probability, and the justification based on the smaller loss, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes as defined. The decision reason would not lead to a preference for one lottery over the other based on the given probabilities and outcomes, as both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. So, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the -6000 Euros outcome has a 45% probability, which is less than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 55% probability, which is higher than 50%. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
- For Lottery A, the -3000 Euros outcome has a 90% probability, which is higher than 50%, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 10% probability, which is less than 50%. Thus, only the -3000 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery A, it is -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and the possibility of winning 0 Euros in both lotteries, noting that the potential loss in Lottery B is twice as high but the possibility of 0 Euros (winning nothing) is higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B, seemingly because the higher possibility of winning 0 Euros outweighed the consideration of the potential loss being twice as high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are the outcomes with probabilities higher than 50%. The individual considered the potential loss and the possibility of winning 0 Euros but did not explicitly calculate or compare averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as they chose Lottery B despite its average probable outcome being 0 Euros, which does not explicitly compare to the -3000 Euros average probable outcome of Lottery A in a manner that suggests a calculation of averages was performed.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they calculated or compared the averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. Instead, the focus was on the magnitude of potential losses and the probabilities of winning nothing, without explicit consideration of the average probable outcomes as the decision reason requires.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are two outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is lower than 0.5, and thus is not considered probable. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5, making it a probable outcome. The outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is lower than 0.5, and thus is not considered probable. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euro outcomes are probable for both lotteries, and both have the same value (0 Euros), the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount and the risk (probability of loss) associated with each lottery, noting that the loss in Lottery B is half that of Lottery A but with double the risk. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss, although with double the risk, is only half as much as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be the average of the 0 Euro outcomes for both lotteries, resulting in an average of 0 Euros for both. The individual, however, focused on the loss amounts and their associated risks, not directly on the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual, however, chose based on a different criterion (comparing loss amounts and risks), which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make their decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since 1/1 = 1. The probable outcomes and their average for each lottery are as follows:
- Lottery B: (1000 Euros * 0.5 + 0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros (since both outcomes are probable, but the calculation directly gives the expected value).
- Lottery A: 500 Euros (since there's only one outcome, which is 100% probable).
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The report mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos,"" which translates to ""consideration of all information,"" indicating the individual looked at all the details provided about the lotteries. It then mentions ""Entscheidung für A bei garantiertem Gewinn,"" which translates to ""decision for A with a guaranteed win,"" suggesting the individual focused on the guaranteed aspect of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to hinge on the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery A, rather than explicitly discussing probabilities or averages of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the probable outcomes and their averages. While the individual considered all the information, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification focuses on the guarantee of winning in Lottery A, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about comparing averages of probable outcomes. The individual's focus was more on the guarantee of the outcome rather than the calculated average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so its single outcome is considered probable by default since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1.
- For Lottery A, both outcomes are probable because both have a 50% probability, which meets the criteria. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the single outcome of -500 Euros is probable, and since it's the only outcome, it is its own average.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, there is at least a chance to lose nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided in the report focuses on the aspect of not losing anything with Lottery A, implying the consideration of the 0 Euro outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the average of probable outcomes for each lottery. The individual's consideration, as stated, focuses on the chance of not losing anything, which aligns with acknowledging one of the outcomes of Lottery A but does not explicitly mention calculating averages or considering the probabilities in the manner the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification, however, emphasizes the possibility of not losing, which doesn't directly reflect the calculation of averages of probable outcomes as per the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on the chance of losing nothing with Lottery A does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason, which involves comparing the averages of probable outcomes. However, the mention of considering the aspect of not losing anything could imply some awareness of the outcomes, but it does not explicitly show the application of the decision reason's rule about averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not clearly demonstrate the application of the decision reason's specific rule regarding the calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes. The individual's focus is more on the qualitative aspect of potential loss rather than the quantitative comparison of outcome averages."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 ≈ 0.33. 
- For Lottery A, the 0 Euros outcome with 75% probability is probable, and the 6000 Euros outcome with 25% probability is not.
- For Lottery B, the 0 Euros outcome with 50% probability is probable, and neither the 4000 Euros nor the 2000 Euros outcomes with 25% probability each are probable.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes identifying the probable outcomes for each lottery and calculating their average.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) as the basis for their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they perceived the winning probability to be higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities, while the individual considered the overall winning probability without specifying how it was calculated or which outcomes were considered.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, whereas the individual's justification is based on a general perception of higher winning probability without specifying the calculation or consideration of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not align with the specific steps and considerations of the decision reason. The individual's focus on ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" (winning probability) is vague and does not directly relate to the calculation of averages of probable outcomes as specified by the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery A, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros (50% probability) since it's the only outcome exceeding the 33.33% threshold.
- For Lottery B, the probable outcome is 0 Euros (75% probability) because it exceeds the 50% threshold.
The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible loss and its probability, focusing on the fact that the potential loss in Lottery A is smaller, even though the loss is more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the possible loss is smaller.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, based on the calculation, would primarily consider the 0 Euro outcome for both lotteries due to their high probabilities. The individual, however, considered the size of the potential loss and its probability, not explicitly the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery A because it has a smaller possible loss, which does not directly align with the rule of comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The focus on the size of the loss rather than the average of probable outcomes suggests a different decision-making process.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there's one outcome (5 Euros with 100% probability), so any probability above 0% makes it probable. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 50%. Thus, for Lottery B, only the 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability is considered probable. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: One probable outcome of 5 Euros.
- Lottery B: One probable outcome of 0 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 5 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win at Lottery A, although low, and the high but very low-probability win at Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the win, although low, is guaranteed, whereas Lottery B offers only a very small chance of a higher win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed nature of the win in Lottery A and the low probability of the win in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would be Lottery A (5 Euros) over Lottery B (0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because it offers a guaranteed win, even though low, suggests they valued the certainty of the outcome, which is consistent with preferring a higher average of probable outcomes as per the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's thought process aligns with the decision reason's rule, focusing on the certainty and value of the probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery A, there's only 1 outcome, so any probability (including 100%) qualifies as probable. 
- Lottery B has a -5000 Euros outcome with 0.1% probability (not probable) and a 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability (probable).
- Lottery A has a -5 Euros outcome with 100% probability (probable).
Thus, the probable outcomes are 0 Euros for Lottery B and -5 Euros for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss of Lottery B but noted it was very unlikely compared to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high loss, although significant, was very unlikely, implying a comparison of the risks and guaranteed outcomes between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which are 0 Euros for Lottery B and -5 Euros for Lottery A. The individual considered the likelihood and magnitude of losses, which aligns with considering the probable outcomes but does not directly mention calculating an average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification implies a consideration of the balance between risk and guaranteed loss but does not explicitly state a preference based on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's consideration of the likelihood and magnitude of losses shows some alignment with the aspects considered by the decision reason, but there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes as the basis for the decision. The verbal report suggests a more intuitive or qualitative comparison rather than a quantitative calculation of averages as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, while there's a slight indication that the individual might have considered factors related to the decision reason, it's far from certain that the decision reason was explicitly used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery B have a 50% probability, which exactly meets this threshold, but given the nature of the reason, we might interpret it as considering both outcomes since they are at the threshold. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is considered probable since its probability (100%) is higher than 1/1 or 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery B, the average of the outcomes is (3000 - 3000)/2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the average (and only outcome) is 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, the win is guaranteed (""der Gewinn garantiert ist"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the guarantee of the win with Lottery A, leading to a decision in favor of A (""Entscheidung für A"").

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of probable outcomes and their average. The individual focused on the guarantee of the win with Lottery A, which implies consideration of the certain outcome of Lottery A but does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes for both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification is based on the guarantee of a win, which aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome (Lottery A's 1500 Euros) over the uncertainty of Lottery B, but does not explicitly state a comparison of averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision to choose Lottery A because it guarantees a win aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (since Lottery A's certain outcome of 1500 Euros is preferable to the average of 0 Euros for Lottery B), the verbal report does not explicitly describe considering the averages of probable outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, the assessment leans towards uncertainty but recognizes a possible implicit alignment with the decision reason's outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Since both outcomes of Lottery B have a probability of 0.5, both are considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only 1 outcome, so its probability of 1.0 makes it a probable outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery B, both 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros are probable; for Lottery A, 2000 Euros is probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The report mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos""), which implies that the individual looked at the details of both lotteries, including their outcomes and probabilities. However, the specific details considered are not mentioned.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A due to the guaranteed win (""garantiertem Gewinn""), indicating that the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: While the decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating averages or identifying outcomes based on their probabilities. However, the individual did consider all information, which could imply they looked at the probabilities and outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery A (average of 2000 Euros) over Lottery B (average of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the guarantee of winning, which aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome over a risky one but does not directly mention the calculation of averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention the specific calculations or considerations that the decision reason is based on. The justification provided (guaranteed win) is related but does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason's rule about averages of probable outcomes. Thus, there is some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was used, but it seems less likely than not based on the information provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, making them both probable. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so its probability of 100% makes it probable by default. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Both outcomes are probable (3000 Euros and -3000 Euros).
- Lottery B: The outcome is probable (1000 Euros).
To calculate the average of probable outcomes for each lottery:
- Lottery A: (3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros)) / 2 = 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: 1000 Euros (since there's only one outcome).
Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher average of probable outcomes (1000 Euros vs. 0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain, while Lottery A has a possible loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because it guarantees a win, implying that the potential for loss in Lottery A was a deterrent.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating or considering the values of all outcomes with a probability higher than a certain threshold. The individual, however, focused on the guarantee of a win in Lottery B and the possibility of loss in Lottery A, not explicitly calculating averages or considering all probable outcomes in the manner described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which leads to a preference for Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B but based on the guarantee of a win and the avoidance of potential loss, not explicitly on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (both prefer Lottery B), but the process described in the verbal report does not closely match the step-by-step analysis required by the decision reason. The individual focused on the guarantee and potential loss rather than calculating or comparing the averages of probable outcomes. Thus, while the outcome is the same, the reasoning process appears different, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision, let's break down the process into the specified steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there's only 1 outcome, so its single outcome is always considered probable since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable because their probabilities (50%) are higher than 1/2 (50%).
- Lottery B has one outcome: 0 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (6000 + (-6000)) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, it is 0 Euros since there's only one outcome of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because a win was possible, implying that the potential for a positive outcome was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in this case, are both 0 Euros for Lotteries A and B. The individual, however, focused on the possibility of winning, which aligns with considering the positive outcome of Lottery A but does not directly address the calculation of averages or the comparison of averages between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have an average of 0 Euros for their probable outcomes, the decision reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, suggests a preference for Lottery A because it offers a chance to win, not necessarily because it has a higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the possibility of winning and their choice of Lottery A because of this possibility do not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, especially since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros) according to the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
