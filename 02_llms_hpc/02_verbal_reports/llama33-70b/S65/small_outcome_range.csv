STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, let's follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 2400 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a smaller difference (0 Euros) between its minimum and maximum outcomes compared to Lottery B (2500 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win of Lottery A and the potential for no loss in Lottery B, noting the small (1%) probability of winning nothing in Lottery B. They also considered the potential for a higher gain (100 Euros more than Lottery A's guaranteed amount) in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the low risk (1% chance of winning nothing) in Lottery B as acceptable for the potential higher gain, without fully considering the probability of achieving the higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, however, focused more on the guaranteed win of one lottery versus the potential higher gain and low risk of no gain in the other, rather than explicitly discussing the range of outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention the range of outcomes or compare them directly between the two lotteries. Instead, they seem to weigh the potential benefits and risks based on different criteria (guaranteed win vs. potential higher gain with a small risk of no win).

Based on these comparisons, it seems that while the individual considered aspects of risk and potential gain, they did not explicitly apply the decision reason that focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision, as the verbal report does not align closely with the criteria specified by the decision reason. However, it is not a perfect match with the description for a 0 assessment because the individual does discuss aspects of risk and potential outcomes, albeit not in the specific manner outlined by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B because 2400 Euros (difference for Lottery B) is less than 2500 Euros (difference for Lottery A).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possible gains/losses and the percentages of the lotteries. They noted the difference in gains (100 Euros) and the difference in percentages (1%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they perceived the potential additional value of 100 Euros to be better than the 1% difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned as a consideration in the verbal report. The individual considered the difference in gains between the two lotteries but not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would lead to choosing Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on a different rationale (comparing the difference in potential gains to the difference in probabilities).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, as evidenced by their focus on the difference in gains between the lotteries and the difference in probabilities, rather than the internal differences within each lottery. Their justification for choosing Lottery A does not align with the decision reason provided."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 3000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 3000 Euros, Difference = 0 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 4000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros, Difference = 4000 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery A (100% chance of winning 3000 Euros) versus the uncertainty in Lottery B (80% chance of winning 4000 Euros and 20% chance of winning 0 Euros). They also thought about the potential regret of ending up with 0 Euros in Lottery B despite its higher potential payout.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of the potential regret associated with the 20% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, while not explicitly mentioning these differences, considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk of getting nothing in Lottery B, which indirectly relates to the differences in outcomes between the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (difference of 0 Euros). The individual chose Lottery A, citing the desire for a certain gain and the avoidance of potential regret from losing, which aligns with preferring a more predictable outcome but does not directly state a comparison of outcome differences.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with the principle of avoiding large outcome discrepancies, as they prioritized the certainty of gain over the potential for a higher reward that comes with a risk of getting nothing. However, the individual does not explicitly discuss the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice and justification align with the preference for a smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes (as they chose the certain gain over the risky option), they did not explicitly state that their decision was based on comparing these outcome differences. The alignment in preference suggests some influence of the decision reason, but the lack of explicit mention of outcome differences introduces some uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the two lotteries (20% vs. 25%) and visualized them as fractions (1/4 and 1/5). They also thought about the difference in probabilities (5%) and the difference in the maximum outcomes (1000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose Lottery A because the 5% difference in probabilities seemed significant, but the 1000 Euros difference in the maximum outcomes did not seem like a large enough difference to justify the lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B. However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention these differences. Instead, the individual focuses on the difference in probabilities and the difference in the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the difference in probabilities and the difference in the maximum outcomes, not explicitly on the difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not provide strong evidence that they used the decision reason to make the decision. While the individual chose Lottery A, which is the lottery preferred by the decision reason, their justification for the choice is based on different factors (difference in probabilities and difference in maximum outcomes). The decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Therefore, I am inclined to believe that the decision reason was not used by the individual, but I am not completely certain, hence the assessment of 20."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. According to the reason, Lottery B is preferred because it has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcome (3000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, noting that the probability of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B is twice as high as winning double that amount in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of its higher probability of winning, motivated by the desire to avoid regret over not taking the safer option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual considered the probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the probability of winning, not the difference between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's choice was based on the probability of winning and avoiding regret. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gains (Gewinne) and losses (Verluste) of the lotteries, as well as the probabilities (Prozentzahlen) of winning. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by noting that while the potential gain was twice as high in Lottery A, the probability of winning in Lottery B was twice as high as in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration. The individual considered the potential gains and the probabilities but did not discuss the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B (3000 Euros difference) over Lottery A (6000 Euros difference). However, the individual's justification is based on the balance between the potential gain and the probability of winning, not on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not a factor mentioned in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B. Instead, the individual's choice was based on the comparison of potential gains and probabilities, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery B has a smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B versus the high probability of losing 4000 Euros in Lottery A but also acknowledges the 20% chance of losing nothing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a chance, albeit small, of not losing any money, which is seen as better than the certainty of a smaller loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a criterion for the individual's decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its smaller difference between minimum and maximum outcomes (0 Euros difference), but the individual chooses Lottery A based on the possibility of avoiding any loss, not explicitly on the difference between the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason provided, as the individual's justification does not mention or imply considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as the basis for their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 75% probability) and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros (with 25% probability), resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (with 80% probability) and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros (with 20% probability), resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual noted that both lotteries only involve losses and considered the 5% difference in the probability of no loss (or gaining nothing) between Lotteries A and B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the 5% difference in the probability of no loss seemed significant enough to them, despite Lottery B having a potentially higher loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the difference in probabilities of no loss and the potential for higher loss in Lottery B). The individual's considerations do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on outcome differences.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (choosing based on the probability difference and potential higher loss). The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a smaller difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes (3000 Euros vs. 4000 Euros for Lottery B), but the individual chose Lottery B based on different criteria.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on the difference in probabilities of no loss and the magnitude of potential losses rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 3000 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing any money in each lottery, focusing on the higher probability of not losing in one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the higher probability of not losing money, which seems to be related to the probability of the 0 Euro outcome in each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probability of not losing money): The individual's focus was on the probability of avoiding loss rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) with the individual’s justification (choosing based on the higher probability of not losing money): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its smaller difference (3000 Euros vs. 6000 Euros), but the justification provided does not mention this aspect.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the probability of not losing money and their justification for the choice do not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (since there's no positive outcome, the ""maximum"" in this context refers to the least negative), and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -6000 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of -6000 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A because -3000 is greater than -6000 (less negative).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries only offer the potential to lose money or for nothing to happen. They also consider the relationship between the potential loss and the probability of that loss, specifically mentioning that for a doubled loss (Lottery B's -6000 Euros compared to Lottery A's -3000 Euros), there is half the probability (0.1% for Lottery B vs. 0.2% for Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice of Lottery B by stating that although 0.1% does not seem much less than 0.2%, it is indeed less, and this difference in probability, despite the higher potential loss, led them to choose Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the relationship between the potential loss and its probability, not directly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its less negative difference between outcomes (-3000 vs. -6000), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the comparative probabilities of loss, not the size of the loss itself.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would lead to a preference for Lottery A, but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on a different consideration (the comparative probabilities of loss). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 500 Euros (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential for a certain gain versus the possibility of winning nothing (0 Euros) with Lottery A, acknowledging the higher potential gain of Lottery A but also its risk. They also recognized that Lottery B offered a secure, albeit lower, gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the secure gain of Lottery B over the potentially higher but riskier gain of Lottery A, citing the certainty of the gain as the reason, despite its lower value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. While the individual did consider the outcomes of both lotteries, their focus was more on the certainty of the gain and the risk of winning nothing, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (since 0 Euros difference is less than 1000 Euros difference). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the certainty of the gain, which aligns with preferring a smaller range of outcomes (in this case, no range at all, as the outcome is certain).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. However, their choice and justification for preferring the certain gain of Lottery B over the riskier but potentially higher gain of Lottery A indirectly aligns with the preference for the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes. This alignment suggests that while the individual may not have explicitly used the decision reason as stated, their decision-making process shares a commonality with it, leading to a similar choice. Therefore, the assessment is not a perfect match (100) but leans towards suggesting the decision reason was used in some form, though not explicitly stated."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. 
For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. 
For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros and the minimum outcome is -500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and is summarized as follows: Lottery B has a difference of 1000 Euros, and Lottery A has a difference of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of not losing anything (0 Euros) with a 50% chance in Lottery B and the certainty of losing -500 Euros in Lottery A, regardless of their current balance.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to take a 50% chance of not losing anything rather than accepting a certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual's consideration of the possibility of not losing in Lottery B and the certainty of losing in Lottery A does not directly reflect the calculation of the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which is Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification focuses on the preference for avoiding a certain loss rather than directly comparing the ranges of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual's preference is driven by the desire to avoid a certain loss and the attraction to the possibility of no loss, rather than a consideration of the outcome ranges. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in both lotteries (1/4 for Lottery B and 2/4 for Lottery A), the potential gain of each lottery (6000 Euros for Lottery B and 4000 or 2000 Euros for Lottery A), and the risk of not winning (75% for Lottery B and 50% for Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher risk of not winning, the potential gain of 6000 Euros was deemed worth more than the potential gains of 4000 or 2000 Euros in Lottery A, reflecting a willingness to take a risk for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's deliberation primarily centered around the potential gains, the risk of not winning, and the willingness to take a risk for a higher reward, rather than explicitly comparing the ranges of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (4000 Euros difference) over Lottery B (6000 Euros difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B, indicating that their justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. The individual's focus was on the potential gains and the risk associated with each lottery, leading to a choice that contradicts the decision reason's preference. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since it's the best among -4000, -2000, and 0) and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros. The difference is 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros. The difference is 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual initially looked at the probabilities because it was the first problem with 3 possible outcomes. Then, they realized both lotteries only had losses, which made the numbers (probabilities) less interesting to them.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would make no losses with a higher probability, which is Lottery B, because it has a 75% chance of 0 Euros (no loss), compared to Lottery A's 50% chance of 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the presence of losses and the probability of not incurring a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (4000 Euros difference vs. 6000 Euros difference for Lottery B). However, the individual's justification is based on the probability of not incurring a loss, not on the difference between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's choice was based on the probability of avoiding a loss, not on comparing the ranges of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome are both 5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain outcome of Lottery A (5 Euros with 100% probability) and the low-probability high outcome of Lottery B (5000 Euros with 0.1% probability). They also considered the implications of winning or not winning in both lotteries, focusing on the significance of the amounts to them personally.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to revolve around the personal significance of the amounts and the impact of winning or not winning, rather than explicitly discussing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of the outcomes as a basis for their decision.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that while the individual's choice might align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was explicitly used by the individual to make the decision, as the verbal report does not directly mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a factor in the choice. However, it's not a 0 because the individual's choice could coincidentally align with the preference suggested by the decision reason, but the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -5 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -5 Euros, since it's a certain outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the amount of potential loss in both lotteries, comparing the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B to the potential loss of 5000 Euros in Lottery A, despite the very low probability of the latter.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the certain loss of 5 Euros is perceived as significantly less severe than the potential loss of 5000 Euros, even though the chance of losing 5000 Euros is very low. The individual also mentions regret as a factor, suggesting that if they were to lose 5000 Euros, they would regret their decision, implying an aversion to the potential for significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. While the individual does consider the outcomes (focusing on the potential losses), they do not explicitly discuss the range or difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery B (with a difference of 0 Euros). The individual chooses Lottery B but justifies this choice based on the perceived severity of potential losses and the certainty of the loss in Lottery B, rather than explicitly stating a preference for the smaller range of outcomes.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's reasoning is more closely related to loss aversion and the perceived magnitude of potential losses rather than the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 1500 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe win) and ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the certainty of gain in one option and the risk of loss in the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the ""sicheren Gewinn"" over the option that includes a potential loss, implying they valued the certainty of a positive outcome over the possibility of a higher gain that also comes with a risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which translates to considering the range of possible outcomes for each lottery. The individual's consideration of a ""safe win"" versus a ""potential loss"" indirectly touches upon the idea of outcome ranges, as they are weighing the certainty of a positive outcome against an option with both higher potential gain and loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on preferring a certain gain over an option that includes the potential for loss, which aligns with preferring the lottery with less variability in outcomes (i.e., the smaller difference between maximum and minimum outcomes).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment is based on the alignment between the decision reason's focus on outcome differences and the individual's preference for a certain gain over an option with potential loss, indicating a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used, though the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) and a ""potentiellen Verlust"" (potential loss), indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of one lottery and the risk of loss in the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides in favor of the ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain), indicating they preferred the option that guarantees a positive outcome without risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual considers the presence of a safe gain versus a potential loss. Although the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of outcomes, their focus on avoiding loss and choosing a guaranteed gain aligns with preferring an option with less variability in outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case is Lottery A with a difference of 0 Euros. The individual chooses Lottery A, citing the preference for a safe gain, which indirectly reflects a preference for less outcome variability.

Given these comparisons, while the individual does not explicitly state they considered the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, their justification for choosing the safe gain (Lottery A) because it avoids potential loss aligns with the principle of minimizing outcome variability. This suggests the individual's decision-making process may have been influenced by a preference for less variability, similar to the decision reason's rule, but it is not a direct application of the reason as stated.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 0 Euros for Lottery A and 6000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of a 1000 Euro gain from Lottery A versus the 50-50 chance of either gaining 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros from Lottery B. They weigh the certainty of a gain against the potential for a significant loss, even when the potential gain is three times higher.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certainty of a gain over the risk of a potential loss, even if the potential gain is larger.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, discusses the certainty of gain versus the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of outcome differences but does not directly address the maximum and minimum outcome differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes, which would be Lottery A. The individual prefers Lottery A due to the certainty of gain, avoiding potential loss, which aligns with preferring a smaller range of outcomes (in this case, no risk of loss) but does not explicitly state it in terms of outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's reasoning about preferring certainty and avoiding potential loss aligns with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring smaller outcome differences), but the verbal report does not explicitly discuss the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there's some alignment in the preference for Lottery A, the direct application of the decision reason as stated is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the smaller difference. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros with 100% probability, meaning both the maximum and minimum outcomes are 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially focuses on Lottery B because it has a 100% certain outcome, noting that nothing changes with this choice. Then, they consider Lottery A, recognizing its 50-50 probability and the equal but opposing outcomes. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because they would rather have no change than take a 50% risk of losing 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual, we see that the individual does consider the nature of the outcomes (certainty vs. risk) but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the basis for their decision.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring no change over a risky outcome), while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference for Lottery B due to its certain outcome (which inherently has the smallest possible difference between outcomes), the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was made based on comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the decision was made by comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used or not used by the individual."
