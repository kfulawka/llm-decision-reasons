1,"each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.assistantTo determine which lottery is preferred by the decision reason, let's follow the steps outlined:

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied**

The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. We need to identify these values for both lotteries:

- **Lottery A:**
  - Maximum outcome: 2500 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
  - Difference: \(2500 - 0 = 2500\) Euros

- **Lottery B:**
  - Maximum outcome: 2400 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
  - Difference: \(2400 - 0 = 2400\) Euros

The relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, so the decision reason can be applied.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes. Comparing the differences:

- Difference for Lottery A: 2500 Euros
- Difference for Lottery B: 2400 Euros

Since 2500 Euros (Lottery A) is greater than 2400 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

     - Minimum outcome = 3000 Euros (since it is certain)
     - Difference = 3000 - 3000 = 0 Euros
   - The relevant information (maximum and minimum outcomes) can be derived from the given probabilities and outcomes of each lottery. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

2. **Apply the Decision Reason**:
   - Compare the differences calculated:
     - Difference for Lottery A = 4000 Euros
     - Difference for Lottery B = 0 Euros
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes is preferred.
   - Lottery A has a larger difference (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros).

6,"the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.assistantTo solve this problem, we need to apply the given decision reason to the decision problem by following the outlined steps:

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.**

The decision reason requires calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery. We need to check if this information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

- For Lottery A:
  - The maximum outcome is 0 Euros (20% probability).
  - The minimum outcome is -4000 Euros (80% probability).
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes is \(0 - (-4000) = 4000\) Euros.

- For Lottery B:
  - The maximum outcome is -3000 Euros (100% probability).
  - The minimum outcome is also -3000 Euros (100% probability).
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes is \(-3000 - (-3000) = 0\) Euros.

The relevant information can be derived, so we can proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes.

- Lottery A has a difference of 4000 Euros.

The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.assistantTo solve this decision problem, we need to apply the given decision reason to the two lotteries, A and B, and determine which lottery is preferred according to the rule specified by the decision reason. Let's proceed step-by-step.

**STEPS:**

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.**

The decision reason is based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. We need to determine if we can derive this information from the given lotteries.

- For Lottery A:
  - Maximum outcome: 0 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: -4000 Euros
  - Difference: 0 - (-4000) = 4000 Euros

- For Lottery B:
  - Maximum outcome: 0 Euros
  - Minimum outcome: -3000 Euros
  - Difference: 0 - (-3000) = 3000 Euros

The relevant information about the outcomes and their differences can be derived from the lotteries. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.

8,". The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.assistantLet's apply the decision reason step-by-step to the given decision problem.

**Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied.**

The decision reason specifies that we should consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. We need to determine if we can derive this information from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

- For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. The minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. The difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is:
  \[
  0 - (-6000) = 6000 \text{ Euros}
  \]

- For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, and the maximum outcome is 0 Euros. The difference between the maximum and minimum outcome is:
  \[
  0 - (-3000) = 3000 \text{ Euros}
  \]

The relevant information about the lotteries can be derived, so we can proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Apply the decision reason.**

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.

- The difference for Lottery A is 6000 Euros.
