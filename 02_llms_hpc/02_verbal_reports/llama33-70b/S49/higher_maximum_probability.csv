STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% (for 2400 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for 2400 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual started by examining Lottery B, then looked at the fields of Lottery A, focusing on the sums and probabilities, particularly to assess if the 1% risk of getting nothing was worth the potential gain. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by considering the risk of losing (1% chance of getting 0 Euros) and the potential gain (100 Euros more than Lottery B), concluding that the risk was not worth the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (sums, probabilities, and the risk associated with Lottery A). The individual did consider probabilities but focused more on the risk and potential gain rather than comparing the maximum probabilities directly.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the risk and potential gain). The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The decision reason emphasizes the comparison of maximum probabilities, which is not the focus of the individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, the maximum probability for both lotteries is the probability of not winning (67% for Lottery A and 66% for Lottery B), as these are the highest probabilities listed for each lottery. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities: 67% for Lottery A and 66% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the similarity between the two lotteries, the difference in potential winnings (Gewinndifferenz), and the difference in probabilities (Prozentzahl).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because it offers 100 € more than Lottery B, despite having a 1% lower probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case is the probability of not winning. The individual, however, focused on the difference in potential winnings and the difference in probabilities of winning, not explicitly on the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability of winning (34% vs 33%), which is the relevant probability when considering the maximum probability of a positive outcome, but the decision reason as stated prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be the probability of not winning, making Lottery A preferred. However, the individual's justification is based on the trade-off between the potential winnings and the probabilities of winning, not directly on comparing the maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, which would be the probability of not winning in this context, but the individual's justification is based on a comparison of the potential winnings and the probabilities of winning, indicating that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for winning 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% for winning 4000 Euros. Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, the relevant information is that Lottery A has a higher maximum probability (100%) than Lottery B (80%).

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the 100% chance of winning with Lottery A as a significant factor, indicating they are focusing on the probability aspect. The individual also acknowledges the higher potential winnings of Lottery B but is deterred by the higher risk of winning nothing. The justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the certainty of the win, which is directly related to the probability of the outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the 100% win chance of Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B), it's clear that the individual's deliberation process involves considering the probabilities of the lotteries, which aligns with the decision reason. Furthermore, the individual's justification for the choice (preferring the certainty of winning with Lottery A over the higher but riskier reward of Lottery B) matches the rule of the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of winning for each lottery. From the problem, Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability. Lottery B offers 4000 Euros with a 20% probability and 0 Euros with an 80% probability. The maximum probability for Lottery A is 75% (for not winning), and for Lottery B, it's 80% (also for not winning). However, since the decision reason focuses on the probability of winning (as implied by ""Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit"" in the verbal report), we consider the probabilities of winning: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the winning probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that Lottery A has a lower potential win but a higher probability of winning compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery A because it offers a higher probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the maximum probabilities of winning, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the higher probability of winning for Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of winning, which matches the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because it has a higher winning probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, closely aligns with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the probability of winning and chooses the lottery with the higher probability, which is exactly what the decision reason suggests.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for winning 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both lotteries to get a complete picture, focusing on the probabilities of winning in each lottery. Specifically, they noted the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, mentioning that the probability of winning something in Lottery B is 45% higher than in Lottery A (though the actual calculation should compare the probabilities of winning, which are 45% for A and 90% for B, indicating a 45 percentage point difference, not percentage increase).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the probabilities of winning in each lottery, noting that despite the lower payout in Lottery B, the higher probability of winning something makes it more appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which in this case would be the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (55% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B). The individual considered the probabilities of winning, which aligns with the concept of looking at probabilities but specifically focused on the probability of winning something rather than the maximum probability of any outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. The individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher probability of winning, which aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher probability of a positive outcome, though not exactly matching the decision reason’s focus on the maximum probability of any outcome.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process closely aligns with the decision reason in terms of prioritizing the lottery with the higher probability of a desired outcome (winning), even though the decision reason technically focuses on the maximum probability of any outcome, not specifically the probability of winning.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher maximum probability. Given the lotteries:
- Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.8% probability.
The maximum probability for both lotteries is the probability of getting 0 Euros, which is 99.9% for Lottery B and 99.8% for Lottery A. Since the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability, the relevant information here is that Lottery B has a higher maximum probability (99.9%) than Lottery A (99.8%). Thus, according to the decision reason, Lottery B should be preferred based on this criterion.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (Gewinnsumme) between the two lotteries and noted that the probability difference is only 0.1%. They also considered the aspect of not making a loss, as both lotteries have a significant chance of resulting in 0 Euros.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery B by mentioning the higher potential winnings and the small difference in probabilities. They also emphasized the importance of not incurring a loss, implying that the 0 Euro outcome in both lotteries was a significant factor in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of getting 0 Euros in both cases. However, the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the 0 Euro outcomes or using the maximum probability as a deciding factor. Instead, they discuss the difference in potential winnings and the small difference in probabilities of winning.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 99.9% probability of getting 0 Euros compared to Lottery A's 99.8%. The individual chose Lottery B but based their justification on different criteria (higher potential winnings and the small probability difference).

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Their justification and consideration focused on different aspects of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a loss of 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 80% for a loss of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially focused on the total outcomes of both lotteries but then considered the probabilities more closely, noting that Lottery A results in a 100% loss, while Lottery B has an 80% chance of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a small chance of not losing (or potentially ""winning"" in the sense of not losing as much as in Lottery A), whereas Lottery A guarantees a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probabilities (100% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with 100%. However, the individual chose Lottery B, justifying it with the presence of a small chance to ""win"" or not lose as much, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the higher maximum probability.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's justification does not directly follow the decision reason's rule, as they chose the lottery with the lower maximum probability of the specific outcome (loss) they were focusing on.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, it's 75% (for 0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the most likely outcomes (0 Euros in both cases).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential loss between the two lotteries and the difference in probabilities of those losses (5% difference).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has a smaller loss but a higher probability of loss compared to Lottery A, despite the probabilities differing by only 5%.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is the probability of not losing (0 Euros) in both cases. The individual, however, focused on the difference in potential losses and the difference in probabilities of those losses, not directly on the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (Lottery A, with 80% probability of 0 Euros), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention choosing based on the maximum probability of not losing. Instead, the individual's choice was influenced by the size of the potential loss and the difference in probabilities of losses.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (for -3000 Euros). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of 55% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of potential losses and their associated probabilities for both lotteries, comparing them to understand the risks better.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the comparison of probabilities, particularly mentioning the higher probability of exiting with 0 Euros in Lottery A, but also acknowledging the lower probability of loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which the individual does seem to consider, but with a focus on the probability of not losing (0 Euros) rather than the maximum probability as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 90% probability. However, the individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, as they discuss the probabilities but seem to focus on the aspect of avoiding loss (getting 0 Euros) rather than directly comparing the maximum probabilities as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates some consideration of probabilities, which is relevant to the decision reason. However, the focus and application of this consideration do not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual's justification seems to mix aspects of probability and outcome without explicitly following the decision reason's criteria, suggesting that while there might be some overlap in considerations, the decision reason as defined was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."
10,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. In this case, the maximum probabilities for both lotteries are the probabilities of winning 0 Euros, which are 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. Since these probabilities can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between 99.9% and 99.8%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential losses of both lotteries (6000 Euros for A and 3000 Euros for B), the probabilities of these losses, and the probabilities of winning 0 Euros in both lotteries (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice of Lottery B by comparing the potential losses (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros) and noting that the probabilities of losing (or winning 0 Euros) are nearly the same for both lotteries. The individual chose Lottery B because it involves a smaller loss with roughly the same probability of occurring as the larger loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probabilities (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B), which the individual also considered but not as the primary basis for their decision. The individual's main consideration was the comparison of potential losses given that the probabilities of these losses were seen as nearly equal.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability (in this case, Lottery A with 99.9%), but the individual chose Lottery B based on the potential loss amounts and the similar probabilities of these losses, not directly based on the maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability as the basis for their decision. Instead, the decision was based on comparing potential losses and their associated probabilities, indicating that the decision reason provided was not the guiding principle in the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 500 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 1000 Euros and 50% chance of 0 Euros.
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 500 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning 500 Euros in Lottery B and the 50% chance of winning nothing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of winning, which is seen as a safe and good win, and deemed Lottery A less preferable due to its 50% chance of winning nothing. The individual also mentioned that the potential higher sum in Lottery A did not have significant importance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B and the uncertainty in Lottery A, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery B with a 100% probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its certainty, which matches the decision reason's preference for the higher maximum probability.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, focusing on the certainty (100% probability) of winning in Lottery B as the primary factor for the choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the single outcome). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of loss in each lottery, the amount of potential loss, and their personal financial situation (having 2000 € available). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it offers a 50% chance of not losing any money, as opposed to Lottery B, which guarantees a loss. The individual also considered their personal financial situation, noting that any loss would not directly impact their wealth but rather reduce potential gains.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probability of loss, amount of potential loss, personal financial situation), it appears the individual considered probabilities but not specifically in the context of identifying the ""maximum probability"" as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery that offers a chance to avoid loss, considering personal financial implications), it seems the individual's decision was influenced by the presence of a non-loss outcome in Lottery A but not explicitly by comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's specific rule of preferring the lottery based on the maximum probability of its outcomes. The individual's focus was more on the presence of a zero-loss outcome and personal financial implications rather than on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). However, the decision reason as stated seems to focus on the probability of winning, which might be interpreted as the probability of getting any positive outcome. For Lottery A, this would be 25% (for 6000 Euros), and for Lottery B, this would be 50% (25% for 4000 Euros + 25% for 2000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, focusing on the probability of winning any amount.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered all aspects (Felder) of the lotteries and compared the overall probabilities of winning between Lottery A and Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the higher probability of winning with Lottery B (50%) compared to Lottery A (25%), despite the difference in potential winnings.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning for each lottery, which aligns with the interpretation of the decision reason focusing on the probability of getting any positive outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability of winning, and the individual chose Lottery B because it has a higher overall probability of winning (50% vs. 25% for any positive amount), which aligns with the decision reason’s rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we proceed step by step.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of this maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 75% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 50% chance of 0 Euros
This information indicates that Lottery A has a higher maximum probability (75%) compared to Lottery B (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of losing money in both lotteries and compared the overall loss between them. They noted that Lottery B has a higher probability of losing money (50%) compared to Lottery A, but also considered the magnitude of the loss.

Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice of Lottery A over Lottery B by focusing on the higher probability of not losing money (75% chance of 0 Euros in Lottery A compared to 50% in Lottery B), despite the potential for a larger loss in Lottery A. This indicates that the individual's decision was influenced by the probability of avoiding a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probability of losing money and the probability of not losing money, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum probability of each lottery).

Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which in this case is Lottery A with a 75% chance of 0 Euros. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the higher probability of not losing money (75% chance of 0 Euros), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritized the higher probability of not losing money (maximum probability) in making their choice.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for winning 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 5 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 99.9% chance of 0 Euros, 0.1% chance of 5000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 100% chance of 5 Euros.
This information is sufficient for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery B (100% chance), the higher potential sum in Lottery A (5000 Euros vs. 5 Euros), and the fact that there's no financial investment required for participating in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to be weighing the certainty of a small gain in Lottery B against the very low probability of a significantly larger gain in Lottery A. They mention trying their luck with Lottery A because of its higher potential payout, despite acknowledging the low probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses solely on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual, however, considers not just the probabilities but also the potential payouts and the absence of a financial investment.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its 100% probability of winning, regardless of the amount. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly prioritize the lottery based solely on the maximum probability but rather balances the certainty of a small gain against the potential for a much larger gain, despite its low probability.

Given these comparisons, the individual does not seem to base their decision solely on the maximum probability of each lottery as the decision reason dictates. Instead, their deliberation involves a more nuanced consideration of potential outcomes and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. 
For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 99.9% (for 0 Euros).
For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for -5 Euros).
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the loss amount of 5 Euros in Lottery A as ""not so much"" and recognized the low risk of losing in Lottery B but was concerned about the potential loss of 5000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by weighing the risk of a significant loss in Lottery B against the certain but smaller loss in Lottery A, indicating a focus on the potential losses and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which is 99.9% for Lottery B and 100% for Lottery A. The individual considered the probabilities of losses but did not explicitly mention comparing the maximum probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding the high loss in Lottery B, not explicitly on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. However, their choice aligns with this reason (preferring Lottery A, which has a 100% maximum probability), but the justification provided does not directly mention comparing maximum probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for their choice. The individual's focus was more on the risk of significant loss rather than on comparing the maximum probabilities of the two lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both the gain and loss outcomes). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the gain outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 50% maximum probability
- Lottery B: 100% maximum probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning for each lottery, specifically the 100% chance of winning with Lottery B and the 50% chance of winning (and 50% chance of loss) with Lottery A. They also considered the amounts to be won.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""sichere Variante"" (safe option) that offers a guaranteed win without the risk of loss, implying they valued the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B over the potential higher gain but also potential loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes, specifically focusing on the guaranteed win in Lottery B, which aligns with the decision reason’s focus on the maximum probability of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which is Lottery B with a 100% probability of winning. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its certainty and the absence of risk, which indirectly reflects a preference for the higher maximum probability (certainty of the outcome).

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's rule, as they preferred the lottery with the higher maximum probability (Lottery B) due to its guaranteed outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% (for winning 2000 Euros). For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% (for both winning 3000 Euros and losing 3000 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts to be won and the probabilities of winning for both lotteries. They specifically compared the probabilities, noting that Lottery A offers a 100% chance of winning, while Lottery B offers only a 50% chance of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the 100% chance of winning was more appealing than the 50% chance offered by Lottery B, especially considering the risk of losing with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery. The individual also considered and compared the probabilities of the two lotteries, specifically highlighting the 100% probability of winning with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. The individual chose Lottery A because of its 100% probability of winning, which aligns with preferring the higher maximum probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual considered the same information as the decision reason (maximum probabilities) and made their choice based on a rule that aligns with the decision reason (preferring the higher maximum probability).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the maximum probability of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher value of maximum probability. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 100% for a gain of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 50% for both a gain of 3000 Euros and a loss of 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 100% chance of winning 1000 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros.
This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the gain from Lottery A and the possibility of loss from Lottery B, noting that Lottery A offers a solid sum with a 100% chance of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery A because it offers a 100% chance of winning, making Lottery B less desirable due to its potential for loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the 100% chance of winning with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability, which aligns with the individual’s preference for Lottery A due to its 100% chance of winning over Lottery B’s 50% chance of winning or losing.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision process aligns with the decision reason, as they both prioritize the certainty of gain offered by Lottery A over the uncertainty and potential loss of Lottery B.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100% (for the outcome of 0 Euros). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers the outcome of receiving 0 Euros as neutral and prefers not to incur losses (as in Lottery A) over receiving nothing (as in Lottery B). The individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on avoiding losses and the neutrality of receiving 0 Euros.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, the decision reason focuses on the maximum probability of each lottery, while the individual seems to focus on the avoidance of losses and the neutrality of the 0 Euro outcome. The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability, which would be Lottery B due to its 100% probability of getting 0 Euros. The individual’s justification, however, does not explicitly mention probabilities but rather the preference for not incurring losses, which aligns with choosing Lottery B but does not directly reference the maximum probability rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not directly mention or imply consideration of the maximum probability of each lottery as the basis for the choice. The focus is more on the avoidance of loss and the neutrality of the outcome in Lottery B, rather than the probability of the outcomes. Therefore, while the choice matches, the reasoning process described does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason regarding maximum probabilities."
