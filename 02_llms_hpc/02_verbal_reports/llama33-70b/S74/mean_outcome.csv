STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2400 / 1 = 2400 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (1633.33 Euros) than Lottery A (2400 Euros is actually higher, indicating an error in the calculation for the purpose of this step, but let's correct that: since 2400 is indeed higher than 1633.33, the preference should actually be for Lottery A according to the correct calculation of mean outcomes as per the reason's rule). However, the correct calculation shows Lottery A has a higher mean outcome, so the reason would prefer Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery A guarantees a monetary gain, which implies they considered the certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The report does not provide a detailed justification but implies a preference for the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of the outcome): The individual's focus was on the guarantee of a monetary gain rather than explicitly calculating mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is actually Lottery A when calculated correctly) to the individual’s justification (preference for the guaranteed outcome): While the decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher mean outcome when calculated correctly, the individual's justification is based on the guarantee of the outcome, not the mean outcome calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on its guaranteed outcome, not the calculation of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that Lotteries A and B differ only marginally.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the higher risk to have the hope of receiving the greater gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the marginal difference between the lotteries and the risk involved.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is based on a calculation. The individual's justification is based on taking a higher risk for a greater potential gain, which aligns with preferring a lottery that offers a higher potential outcome but does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason as defined, which calculates and compares mean outcomes based on the sum of outcomes divided by the number of outcomes, independent of probabilities. The report focuses on the marginal difference and the desire for a higher gain through taking more risk, which is somewhat aligned with the general direction of the decision reason (preferring the higher potential gain) but does not demonstrate the specific calculation or consideration of mean outcomes as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for a higher potential outcome, the specific method and reasoning process described in the decision reason are not clearly reflected in the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 3000 / 1 = 3000 Euros. Since Lottery A has a higher mean outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that there is no risk of loss with both lotteries and decides to take the greater risk to receive a gain, implying a consideration of the potential gains and the probabilities (referred to as ""geringerer Prozentsatz,"" which translates to ""lower percentage,"" possibly referring to the 20% chance of not winning in Lottery B).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the aspect of risk and the potential for gain, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of mean outcomes or comparing the total expected values of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk and the potential for gain as described in the verbal report.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention calculating mean outcomes or directly comparing the lotteries based on this criterion. Instead, the individual seems to be motivated by the desire to take a risk for a potentially higher gain, without clearly articulating a preference based on the mean outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual calculated and compared the mean outcomes of the two lotteries as the basis for their choice.

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that both lotteries contain probabilities of winning money and that no loss is expected. They also mention choosing a higher risk with a lower probability of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on the presence of risk and the absence of potential loss, rather than explicitly comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason relies on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the presence of risk and the absence of loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on risk and probability of winning without directly comparing mean outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The verbal report does not directly mention calculating mean outcomes or comparing them as the basis for the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the mean is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery A (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery B (1500 Euros), according to this reason, Lottery A is preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of winning in Lottery B being higher than in Lottery A, which indicates they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the comparison of probabilities between the two lotteries, without mentioning the outcomes or their mean values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is not reflected in the individual’s justification that focuses on the higher probability of winning in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is the basis of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
6,"STEPS:

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (1500 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that there is no risk of losing money in either lottery, implying they considered the outcomes (no negative outcomes) and possibly the concept of risk, though the latter is vaguely defined in this context.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take a greater risk to obtain a higher monetary value. This implies they considered the potential gains and the concept of risk, aiming for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their mean) with that considered by the individual (outcomes, no risk of loss, and concept of risk for higher gain): The individual's consideration of outcomes aligns partially with the decision reason, but there's no explicit mention of calculating means or comparing them directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (taking a greater risk for a higher monetary value): The individual's justification hints at a preference for higher potential gains, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher mean outcome, but the process described doesn't explicitly match the decision reason's calculation-based approach.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report shows some alignment with the decision reason in terms of preferring higher potential gains, but it lacks explicit mention of calculating or comparing mean outcomes, which is central to the decision reason. The focus on risk and higher monetary value without explicit calculation or comparison of means suggests that while the individual's choice might coincide with the decision reason's preference, the underlying process described does not closely follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but there's a slight inclination towards considering higher outcomes, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-2000 > -3000).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the possibility of not incurring a financial loss in Lottery B, which implies they considered the 0 Euro outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification focuses on the possibility of no loss, which does not directly mention comparing mean outcomes or explicitly considering all outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering all outcomes of both lotteries to calculate the mean, but the verbal report only mentions the possibility of no loss in Lottery B, not explicitly considering all outcomes or their mean.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual’s justification is based on avoiding loss, not on comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered all outcomes to calculate and compare mean outcomes, which is crucial for the decision reason. The focus on avoiding loss does not align with the decision reason’s rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome calculated by simply averaging all possible outcomes regardless of their probabilities. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery B since -1500 is greater than -2000.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery A contains lower probabilities of an unfavorable decision, which implies they are considering the probabilities of the negative outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided focuses on the probability of an unfavorable outcome in Lottery A being lower, not directly on the mean outcomes or their comparison.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual discusses probabilities of unfavorable decisions, not the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual justifies their choice based on the probability of unfavorable outcomes, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on probabilities of unfavorable outcomes and not on calculating or comparing mean outcomes suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not used by the individual.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome, the mean outcome is -500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same mean outcome of -500 Euros when calculated in this specific manner. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual seems to focus on the expected loss (or ""zu erwartende Verlust"" in German), which implies a consideration of both the outcomes and their probabilities. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is that the expected loss appears to be the least. This suggests the individual considered the probabilistic nature of the outcomes, as the expected loss in Lottery A would be (-1000 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros, and for Lottery B, it's -500 Euros with 100% probability, making the expected losses equal in value but the individual's reasoning emphasizes the appearance of the least loss, possibly hinting at a risk-averse approach or a consideration of the certainty of the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes ignoring probabilities) with that considered by the individual (expected loss, considering probabilities), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason ignores probabilities, while the individual's consideration explicitly mentions expected loss, which is probability-dependent.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference based on mean outcomes) to the individual's justification (preference based on expected loss), the focus and criteria for decision-making differ. The individual's justification does not mention calculating means of outcomes without considering probabilities, which is the core of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of expected loss, taking into account the probabilities of the outcomes, which does not align with the decision reason that ignores probabilities and calculates mean outcomes simply by averaging them without considering their likelihood. This discrepancy suggests the individual did not use the specified decision reason to make the decision."

Since the mean outcome of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of each lottery) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""persönlichen Entscheidung"" (personal decision) based on the ""geringsten Risiko Geld zu verlieren"" (lowest risk of losing money). This suggests the individual considered the risk of losing money in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of a personal decision to minimize the risk of losing money, implying they were motivated by avoiding loss rather than maximizing gain or considering the mean outcomes.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (5000 + 0) / 2 = 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (5) / 1 = 5 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Die Lotterie B grantiert einen Wertgewinn,"" which translates to ""Lottery B guarantees a value gain."" This suggests the individual considered the guaranteed aspect of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies that the guarantee of a value gain (in this case, 5 Euros) is the justification for choosing Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning calculations or comparisons of mean outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed value gain of Lottery B). The individual's consideration does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (guarantee of a value gain).

Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that ""Lotterie A besitzt eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit Geld zu verlieren,"" which translates to ""Lottery A has a higher probability of losing money."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of losing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the probability aspect of losing money in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of losing money in Lottery A). The individual's focus is on the probability of losing, not the mean outcome of the lotteries, which indicates a potential mismatch.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (probability of losing money). The decision reason and the individual's consideration do not align because the decision reason is based on mean outcomes, not probabilities of loss.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries or apply the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome based on the provided verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1500 / 1 = 1500 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher mean outcome according to this calculation, the reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries and their number, which can be derived from the given lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery B generates a fixed amount (""Festbetrag"") and is without loss (""ohne Verlust""). This implies the individual considered the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome and the absence of potential loss.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the certainty and non-negative aspect of Lottery B, which suggests the individual valued the guaranteed gain and the avoidance of potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes calculated ignoring probabilities) with that considered by the individual (certainty and absence of loss in Lottery B): The individual's focus does not directly align with calculating mean outcomes as per the decision reason. Instead, the individual emphasizes the certainty and lack of potential loss.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (valuing certainty and no loss): The decision reason's rule and the individual's justification do not directly align. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes, which is central to the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing mean outcomes of the lotteries by ignoring their probabilities. The focus on certainty and absence of loss suggests a different decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 2000 / 1 = 2000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Festpreis ohne Risiko"" (fixed price without risk), indicating they considered the risk aspect and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to focus on the absence of risk in Lottery B, implying a preference for certainty over potential risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which does not directly relate to the individual's focus on risk and guaranteed outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification is based on the absence of risk rather than a comparison of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's focus on the guaranteed outcome and the absence of risk in Lottery B, as stated in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Lotterie B enthält einen grantierten Gewinn.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean is (1000) / 1 = 1000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B contains a guaranteed gain (""grantierten Gewinn"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the guaranteed nature of the gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, while the individual focuses on the guaranteed gain of Lottery B. These are not directly comparable, as the individual's consideration does not explicitly mention calculating means or comparing outcomes in the manner described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its guaranteed gain, not explicitly on the mean outcome or a comparison of means between the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's focus on the guaranteed gain of Lottery B and lack of mention of calculating or comparing mean outcomes between the two lotteries suggest that the decision reason, which specifically considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B guarantees no financial loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the guarantee of no financial loss provided by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, while the individual focuses on the guarantee of no financial loss. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome (0 Euros), it would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on avoiding financial loss, not comparing mean outcomes. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason that compares mean outcomes to make the decision.
