<|assistant|>
STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner. The decision reason is concerned with the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information regarding the differences in outcomes can be derived from the given probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason's rule. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. Lottery B has a difference of 0 Euros between its maximum and minimum outcomes, while Lottery A has a difference of 4000 Euros. Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER:
STEPS: Lottery A offers 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability, leading to a difference of 4000 Euros. Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with 100% probability, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smallest outcome difference.
