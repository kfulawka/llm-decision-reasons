STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (2400 * 1) = 2400 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 2409 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the 33% chance of winning more in Lottery A compared to Lottery B, and the small risk of winning nothing. 
Second, the individual justifies the choice by stating that the small risk is worth taking, despite considering it negligible, to potentially win more.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the two lotteries) with that considered by the individual (chance of winning more, small risk of winning nothing), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (willingness to take a small risk to win more), it seems that the individual's justification is related to the concept of expected value, but not explicitly stated as such. The individual focuses on the potential upside and the small downside risk rather than directly comparing the expected outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's decision might align with the decision reason's outcome (since Lottery A has a higher expected value and the individual seems to be willing to take the risk for a potential higher gain), the verbal report does not clearly show that the decision reason (comparing expected values) was directly used by the individual to make the decision. The individual's focus is more on the risk and potential upside rather than on calculating or comparing expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is 2400 * 0.34 = 816 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is 2500 * 0.33 = 825 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the given information, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes that the probabilities of winning in both lotteries are very similar and that the potential gains are also similarly high. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the potentially higher gain, implying they chose the lottery with the higher potential win amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (similar probabilities and potential gains). The individual does not explicitly mention expected values or calculations but focuses on the similarity in probabilities and the potential win amounts.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the potentially higher gain). The decision reason suggests choosing Lottery B due to its higher expected value (825 Euros vs. 816 Euros), but the individual's justification is based on the potential gain, not the calculated expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process as described does not directly align with the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries. The focus on potential gain without explicit consideration of the probabilities to calculate expected values suggests that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice. However, the choice made (potentially choosing the lottery with the higher potential gain, which in this case aligns with the lottery having the higher expected value) could superficially suggest some alignment, but the reasoning process described does not support this. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a slight possibility due to the outcome alignment."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 Euros * 100% = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 Euros * 80%) + (0 Euros * 20%) = 3200 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros versus the risk of possibly gaining nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred having 3000 Euros with certainty over taking the risk associated with Lottery B, emphasizing the importance of a guaranteed gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries (3000 Euros for Lottery A and 3200 Euros for Lottery B), while the individual considered the certainty of the gain and the risk of losing, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for a certain gain over a risky option, which aligns more with a risk-averse approach rather than a straightforward comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report suggests a focus on risk aversion and the value of certainty, rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected values to make a decision and the individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply a comparison of expected values, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is 3000 * 0.25 + 0 * 0.75 = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is 4000 * 0.20 + 0 * 0.80 = 800 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of the lotteries. The individual mentions looking at the probabilities (""Wahrscheinlichkeiten angeschaut"") of the lotteries.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on preferring a higher probability of winning (""eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Gewinn""). This indicates the individual focused on the chance of winning rather than the potential monetary value or the expected value of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities), it's clear they focused on different aspects. The individual did not mention considering the expected value or the monetary outcomes in their deliberation.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual's justification (preferring a higher probability of winning), the two do not align. The decision reason is based on expected monetary value, while the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is the same for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A to be higher and mentioned that they had already taken a risk in the two previous rounds.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of its higher probability of winning and due to previous risk-taking.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, but the individual's report does not mention expected values or any calculation related to them. Instead, the individual focuses on the probability of winning and previous risk-taking.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the probability of winning and previous risk-taking behavior, not on expected values.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 3000 * 0.002 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 6000 * 0.001 = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probability of winning something in each lottery. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it has a higher probability of winning something. The described deliberation process focuses on the comparison of winning probabilities, not on the expected values or the amount of money that can be won.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) does not match the information considered by the individual (probability of winning). 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not match the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning). The individual's justification would lead to choosing Lottery A because it has a 0.2% chance of winning, which is higher than Lottery B's 0.1% chance, even though the expected values are equal.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is -3000 Euros since it has a 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery: Lottery B has an expected value of -3200 Euros, and Lottery A has an expected value of -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the probabilities (""Wahrscheinlichkeiten"") of the lotteries, indicating they looked at the chance of losing no money in one of the lotteries.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prioritizes participating in the lottery where there's a chance to lose no money over the one where the loss is certain from the start. This suggests the individual values the possibility of avoiding a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the chance of not losing money). The individual's focus was on the presence of a chance to avoid loss rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the chance to avoid a certain loss). The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery A because it has a higher expected value (-3000 Euros vs. -3200 Euros), but the individual's justification seems to prioritize the psychological aspect of avoiding a certain loss, which aligns with preferring Lottery B due to its 20% chance of losing no money.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on the psychological aspect of avoiding a certain loss and the presence of a chance to lose no money, rather than a comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on comparing expected values, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_B = (-4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = -800 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is: EV_A = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of the lotteries, as they mention having to look at the probabilities several times. Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is based on selecting the ""potentiell geringeren Verlust,"" which translates to ""potentially smaller loss."" This suggests the individual focused on minimizing the potential loss rather than directly comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential loss), it appears the individual did consider aspects of the lotteries but not explicitly the expected values. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring the potentially smaller loss), there is a conceptual alignment since preferring a smaller loss could indirectly relate to preferring a higher expected value in this context, but it's not a direct application of the decision reason as it does not explicitly mention expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while there's a conceptual connection between minimizing loss and the decision reason's focus on expected value, the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of explicitly comparing expected values to make the decision. The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason was directly applied, suggesting that the individual's thought process, although related, did not explicitly follow the decision reason's criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value, indicating the decision reason would be indifferent between the two.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries, noting that Lottery A had a high probability of losing money, while Lottery B had a 55% chance of not losing anything (which seems to be a misunderstanding since the 55% refers to not winning, not not losing, in the context of the provided probabilities).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the perceived certainty of losing in Lottery A versus the chance of not losing (actually, not winning) in Lottery B, based on the probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and the concept of losing/not losing): The individual does not mention expected values or any calculation that would directly relate to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the probabilities of losing or not losing): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as there's no mention of comparing expected outcomes or values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process, nor does their justification align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery, was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing money in Lottery A (0.2%) and implies a comparison with the potential loss, focusing on the aspect of taking a ""somewhat higher risk"" but potentially losing less.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the low probability of losing money and the preference for taking a slightly higher risk to lose less if the loss occurs.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, but the individual discusses probabilities and potential losses without explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the preference for a lower loss amount given a low probability of loss, not explicitly on which lottery has a higher expected value.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the expected value calculation. The individual focuses on the risk of loss and the amount of potential loss rather than the expected value of the lotteries.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 0.5) + (0 Euros * 0.5) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 Euros * 1) = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent between them. The relevant information for this reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions wanting to ""be on the safe side"" (auf Nummer sicher gehen), which implies considering the risk or certainty of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because it was the safer option, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (safety or certainty of the outcome). The individual's consideration does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preference for safety). Since both lotteries have the same expected value according to the decision reason, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (safety), the decision reason's rule does not match the individual's justification.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is -500 Euros (since -500 Euros * 100% = -500 Euros). For Lottery B, the EV is -500 Euros ((-1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = -500 Euros). Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the desire to leave with at least +1500 Euros and perceives the risk of losing half (in Lottery A, this implies the certain loss of 500 Euros) as too high.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual chose Lottery B because they wanted to achieve a gain of at least +1500 Euros and believed the risk associated with Lottery A (certain loss of 500 Euros) was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (desire for a gain, risk perception), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values in their deliberation process as described.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on achieving a high gain and avoiding a certain loss), there seems to be a discrepancy. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value, but the individual’s justification suggests a focus on potential gains and risk avoidance rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the expected values of the lotteries or used the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher expected value to make their decision. The individual's focus was on the potential for gain and the avoidance of certain loss, rather than on the expected values of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of the product of each outcome and its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning, specifically mentioning the preference for having a 50% chance of winning something over a 25% chance. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the preference for a higher probability of winning something, rather than focusing on the expected monetary value.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning): The individual focused on the probabilities of winning rather than the expected values of the lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a 50% chance of winning something): The decision reason and the individual's justification are based on different criteria. The individual's decision is not based on the expected value but on the probability of winning something. 
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as: (0.25 * -6000) + (0.75 * 0) = -1500 Euros.
For Lottery B, the EV is: (0.25 * -4000) + (0.25 * -2000) + (0.50 * 0) = -1500 Euros.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the monetary outcomes and their respective probabilities. This information is used to calculate the expected value of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing money in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed the chance of not losing money was greater in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values calculated from outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (chance of not losing money): The individual's consideration does not directly align with calculating expected values but focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prefer the lottery with a greater chance of not losing money): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention or imply calculating or comparing expected values but instead focuses on the risk of loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the risk of losing money rather than on calculating and comparing the expected monetary outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 5 Euros * 100% = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential to win more money and the felt possible gain in Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the higher potential win and the perceived higher possible gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential to win more money, felt possible gain), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values in their deliberation process.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (higher potential win and perceived higher possible gain), it seems the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the expected values of both lotteries are equal, but the individual chose based on the potential for a higher win, not the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that the decision to choose Lottery B was based on the potential for a higher win and the perceived possible gain, rather than the expected value of the lotteries, which are equal for both options. This suggests that the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (-5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -5 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is -5 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, indicating that the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the importance of not taking a risk and losing a significant amount of money, preferring to ""play it safe"" by losing only 5 Euros. This suggests the individual considered the potential losses and the concept of risk.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about avoiding risk and ensuring a certain, albeit smaller, loss rather than risking a larger loss. This indicates the individual's decision was influenced by risk aversion and a preference for certainty over potential larger losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of significant loss, preference for certainty), it appears the individual focused more on the risk aspect and less on the expected monetary value.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk, preferring a certain outcome), it seems the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since both lotteries have the same expected value but the individual chose based on risk aversion rather than expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on avoiding risk and ensuring a certain outcome rather than comparing the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value of each lottery and both lotteries have the same expected value, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1500 Euros * 100% = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are 1500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning in Lottery A and the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery B with a 50% probability. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they wanted to take the safe option and avoid the high risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's consideration focuses on the risk and certainty of outcomes rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on avoiding risk, not explicitly on comparing expected values. 
Based on these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. For Lottery A, the EV is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (2000 * 1) = 2000 Euros. Therefore, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A has an expected value of 0 Euros and Lottery B has an expected value of 2000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guarantee of winning 2000 Euros with Lottery B and the risk of losing money with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it provided a guarantee of winning 2000 Euros, and the risk of losing money with Lottery A was too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the expected values of the lotteries, but the individual's considerations were focused on the guarantee of winning and the risk of loss, not explicitly on expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery B. The individual also chose Lottery B, but the justification provided is based on the guarantee and risk, not the comparison of expected values.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery B), but the justification provided does not explicitly mention or imply a calculation or consideration of expected values. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the outcome for Lottery B and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than a direct comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason (comparing expected values) was explicitly used in the decision-making process. The justification provided is more related to risk aversion and the appeal of a guaranteed gain rather than a calculated comparison of expected values."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of Lottery A and Lottery B. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1000 * 1) = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""Sicherheit"" which translates to ""safety"" or ""security"", indicating that the certainty of winning was important to them. This suggests the individual considered the certainty of the outcome, particularly the guaranteed win in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's statement implies that the security of winning something was a key factor in their decision, suggesting they preferred the lottery that guarantees a win over the one with a 50% chance of losing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning). The individual's focus was on the certainty of winning rather than the expected monetary value of the lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with a guaranteed win). The decision reason would lead to preferring Lottery B due to its higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome, not the expected value.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the expected values of the lotteries in their decision-making process as described in the verbal report. However, the outcome of their decision (preferring Lottery B) aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (since Lottery B has a higher expected value), but the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's focus on expected value.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0. For Lottery A, the expected value is (0 * 1) = 0. Both lotteries have an expected value of 0. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the lotteries and their past behavior of playing it safe, indicating they have a buffer to take risks now.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the risk, implying they chose Lottery B, because they had played it safe in the past and now have a buffer to afford the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are the same for both lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was more about their past behavior and the ability to take risks, not explicitly about expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since they have the same expected value. The individual's justification, however, is based on their personal risk-taking capacity and past behavior, not on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that focuses on the expected value of the lotteries. The individual's justification is based on personal risk tolerance and past behavior rather than a comparison of expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected values was not used by the individual to make the decision."
