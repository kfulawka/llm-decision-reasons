STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 + 2400 + 0 = 4900 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. Since we can derive the necessary information (the outcomes) from the lotteries, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both Lottery A and Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the ""sicheren Gewinn,"" which translates to ""safe win"" or ""certain gain,"" implying they chose Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. However, the verbal report does not mention the individual calculating or considering these sums.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. In contrast, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was the certainty of the gain, not the sum of the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual chose Lottery B for its certainty, not because of the sum of its outcomes compared to Lottery A. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
2,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 2500 Euros (since the 0 Euro outcome does not contribute to the sum). For Lottery B, the sum is 2400 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these two sums: 2500 Euros for Lottery A vs. 2400 Euros for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential winnings of each lottery and their respective probabilities, noting that Lottery A offers a higher potential win but Lottery B has a slightly higher probability of winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the comparison of potential winnings and the probabilities of winning between the two lotteries, highlighting the trade-off between the higher potential win in Lottery A and the slightly higher probability of winning in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the sum of outcomes for each lottery, which the individual does not explicitly mention. Instead, the individual discusses the potential winnings and probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based solely on the sum of outcomes but rather weighs the potential winnings against the probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes independent of probabilities. The report focuses on the trade-off between potential winnings and probabilities rather than the sum of the outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher outcome sum (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery A (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered both Lottery A and Lottery B. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is the desire to avoid risk, even when the probability of winning is high. This suggests that the individual prioritized the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes for each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the desire to avoid risk), it appears that the individual did not focus on the sum of outcomes. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (avoiding risk), these two do not align. The individual's justification is based on risk aversion, not on comparing the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 4000 + 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 + 0 = 3000 Euros. Since 4000 > 3000, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries, which are available.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and probabilities of both lotteries, as indicated by ""Ich hatte mir zuerst Lotterie A angesehen und dann Lotterie B"" which translates to ""I first looked at Lottery A and then Lottery B"". 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on the comparison of the amounts and the probabilities of winning, as stated by ""Zwar war der Betrag niedriger aber die Chance auf den Gewinn höher"" which translates to ""Although the amount was lower, but the chance of winning was higher"". This suggests the individual considered both the monetary outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and probabilities), it appears the individual considered more information than just the outcomes. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, independent of probabilities) to the individual's justification (considering both the amount and the probability of winning), it seems the individual's decision process involved a consideration of probabilities, which is not part of the decision reason's rule. The decision reason solely focuses on the sum of outcomes without considering probabilities, whereas the individual's justification implies a consideration of both outcome amounts and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 3000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros), and for Lottery B, the sum is 6000 Euros (since the other outcome is 0 Euros). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery B has a higher outcome sum than Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of winning something in each lottery, comparing the probabilities of winning between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the perceived higher chance of winning something in one of the lotteries compared to the other.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the chance of winning something in each lottery): The individual focused on probabilities, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (based on the perceived higher chance of winning): The individual's justification does not match the decision reason's rule, as it is based on probability rather than the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros + 0 Euros = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + 0 Euros = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a higher outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered both Lottery A and Lottery B and then focused on the probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The verbal report does not explicitly mention the individual’s justification for choosing one lottery over the other but indicates that the decision was influenced by the probability of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the sum of the outcomes, but the individual considered the probability, which does not directly relate to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification seems to be based on the probability, not the sum of the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes, as the verbal report emphasizes consideration of probabilities rather than outcome sums.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -4000 + 0 = -4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the structure of both lotteries, noting that Lottery B results in a loss with 100% probability, while Lottery A offers a 20% chance of not losing anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the aspect of losing or not losing, highlighting the chance of not losing anything in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more about the presence of a chance to avoid loss rather than the total sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B since -3000 is greater than -4000. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the chance of avoiding loss, which aligns more with the concept of minimizing risk or maximizing the chance of a better outcome rather than directly comparing the sum of all outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason that considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities. The focus on avoiding loss and the presence of a chance to not lose anything does not reflect a consideration of the total outcome sum as the basis for the decision."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros + 0 Euros = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is -4000 Euros + 0 Euros = -4000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is greater than -4000 Euros, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The report does not specify what information the individual considered, only that they looked at both lotteries and found the decision difficult.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on ""Bauchgefühl,"" which translates to ""gut feeling"" or intuition, without providing a specific reason or consideration of the lotteries' outcomes or probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.

To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros (since 0 Euros is also an outcome but does not contribute to the sum) and for Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not losing (which implies considering the probabilities of winning or not losing) and the potential loss amount in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the higher potential loss, they perceived the chance of not losing as higher in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses solely on the sum of outcomes (-3000 Euros for Lottery A and -6000 Euros for Lottery B), which does not align with the individual's considerations of probabilities and potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery A (-3000 Euros > -6000 Euros), but the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B does not mention the sum of outcomes or compare the total potential losses in this manner.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the sum of outcomes independent of probabilities. The individual considered probabilities and the magnitude of potential losses, which differs from the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is -3000 Euros (since the outcome of 0 Euros with 99.8% probability does not contribute to the sum in a meaningful way under this reason, as the focus is on the sum of the outcomes, not their probabilities). For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions looking at both lotteries and deciding based on the lower probability of losing money. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of losing in each lottery.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is based on the ""geringere Wahrscheinlichkeit"" (lower probability) of losing money, which implies the individual focused on the probability of the negative outcome rather than the sum of the outcomes themselves.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of losing), there seems to be a mismatch. The decision reason focuses on the total outcome value, while the individual focused on the probability of losing.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (preferring based on the lower probability of losing), it's clear that the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's justification does not mention the sum of outcomes or compare them, which is the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability, so the sum is simply 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros, so the sum is 1000 + 0 = 1000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which in this case would be Lottery B because 1000 Euros (sum of outcomes in B) is greater than 500 Euros (sum of outcomes in A). The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The report mentions looking at both lotteries and considering taking a risk without mentioning specific calculations or comparisons of outcomes. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is a ""Bauchentscheidung"" (gut feeling) and the willingness to take a risk when there's no loss, which doesn't directly relate to calculating or comparing the sums of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the sum of all outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (general consideration of risk and no explicit mention of outcome sums), it seems the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of outcomes as stated in the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification (a gut feeling and willingness to take risk without loss), there's no direct alignment. The individual's justification does not mention comparing the sums of the outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros with 100% probability, so its sum is simply -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, each with 50% probability, but since the reason calculates the sum independent of probabilities, we add -1000 + 0 = -1000 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has an outcome sum of -500 Euros, and Lottery B has an outcome sum of -1000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual looked at both lotteries and noticed that with Lottery A, there's a guaranteed loss, while with Lottery B, there's at least a chance not to lose as much.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify their choice based on the presence of a chance to minimize loss with Lottery B compared to the guaranteed loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the sums of the outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the guaranteed loss in Lottery A vs. the chance of not losing as much in Lottery B). The individual's considerations do not explicitly mention calculating the sum of outcomes for each lottery independent of their probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the chance to minimize loss). The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because -500 Euros is greater than -1000 Euros, but the individual's justification does not align with this rule, as they seem to value the chance of avoiding a larger loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's considerations and justification do not match the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the sum of its outcomes independent of probabilities. The verbal report indicates the individual was influenced by the presence of a chance to minimize loss rather than the sum of outcomes, suggesting the decision reason was not used."

For Lottery A, the sum of outcomes is 6000 Euros (4000 + 2000 + 0), and for Lottery B, the sum of outcomes is 6000 Euros (6000 + 0). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the outcomes and the chances of winning something in both lotteries, focusing on the fact that Lottery A offered a higher chance of getting at least something.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of the chances of winning something in both lotteries, not directly on the sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of all outcomes, but the individual's consideration was on the chances of winning and the amount, not explicitly on the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, but the individual's justification is about the higher chance of getting at least something, which does not directly relate to the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

For Lottery B, the sum is -6000 + 0 = -6000 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same outcome sum, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at Lottery A first, then at Lottery B, and considered the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for the choice was the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B, which was ""ausschlaggebend"" (decisive).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, but the individual considered the probability of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B, not the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum (or is indifferent if the sums are equal), but the individual's justification was based on the probability of a specific outcome, not the sum of outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certain gain of 5 Euros over the low probability of a higher gain, indicating a preference for certainty over a risky, high-reward option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

For Lottery B, the sum is 1500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of the outcomes for each lottery, which is 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1500 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual looked at both Lottery A and Lottery B and considered the potential to win less and the risk of losing something.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the risk of losing and the potential for a lower win, implying a consideration of the potential downsides and benefits but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the sum of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the sum of all outcomes for each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is more on the risk and potential loss rather than the sum of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher outcome sum, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly align with this rule, as it focuses on the risk and potential win rather than the sum of outcomes.

The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 2000 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros + (-3000 Euros) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A over Lottery B because 2000 Euros is greater than 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considered both Lotterie A and Lotterie B, focusing on the aspect of risk. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was to avoid risk and opt for the certain gain, which implies a preference for the guaranteed outcome over the risky one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (risk and certain gain), it appears the individual did not directly consider the sum of outcomes as described by the decision reason. The individual focused on risk avoidance rather than the total sum of possible outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the higher outcome sum) to the individual's justification (avoiding risk for a certain gain), it's clear the individual's decision was not based on the sum of the outcomes but on the presence or absence of risk. The decision reason and the individual's justification do not align.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by calculating the sum of all outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, the sum is 1000 Euros (since there's only one outcome). For Lottery B, the sum is 3000 Euros - 3000 Euros = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the sum of outcomes for each lottery: 1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first considered Lottery A and then Lottery B. The individual's justification for the choice is the desire to avoid risk because the gain was certain with Lottery A. The individual focused on the certainty of the gain in Lottery A as the primary reason for their choice, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the sum of outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (sum of outcomes) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain and risk avoidance), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the sum of all outcomes as described by the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding risk due to the certain gain in Lottery A) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher sum of outcomes). However, the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A because its outcome sum is higher than Lottery B's) coincidentally aligns with the individual's choice. Despite this, the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not indicate the use of the specific rule about the sum of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the sum of all outcomes of each lottery, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the sum is 6000 Euros - 6000 Euros = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the sum is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries since both have the same outcome sum.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered both Lottery A and Lottery B, focusing on the aspect of risk associated with the amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for their choice was to avoid risk, specifically mentioning not wanting to take a risk with the amount involved.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the sum of outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual talks about avoiding risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher outcome sum or being indifferent if the sums are equal) does not align with the individual's justification (avoiding risk). The individual's choice seems to be based on risk aversion rather than the sum of outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates a focus on risk avoidance rather than the sum of outcomes, which is the core of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
