STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is:
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 1% probability
- Lottery B: 2400 Euros with 100% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the possible difference in winnings between Option A and Option B and the risk of ending up with 0 Euros in Option A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential gain difference was not high enough to risk ending up with 0 Euros. They also mentioned that if the payouts were higher, they would have considered taking the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is explicitly mentioned by the individual as a concern (the risk of ending up with 0 Euros). This indicates that the individual did consider the aspect of the minimum outcome, aligning with the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, Lottery B has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (2400 Euros), which is higher than Lottery A's 1% probability of its minimum outcome (0 Euros). The individual's justification implies a preference for avoiding the risk of the 0 Euro outcome, which aligns with preferring the lottery with a higher probability of its minimum outcome (in this context, the guaranteed 2400 Euros).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's consideration of the risk of the minimum outcome and their justification for choosing the option that guarantees a higher minimum outcome (Lottery B) directly align with the decision reason's rule. This suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, the minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 67%, and for Lottery A, it is 66%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference a 1% change in probability could make and decided based on the potentially higher chance of winning, also considering the maximum risk of ending up with 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the perception of a higher chance of winning and the acceptable risk of ending up with no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a key factor. The individual discusses the potential for a higher win and the risk, not directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. In this case, that would be Lottery B with a 67% probability of 0 Euros. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome but rather on the perceived higher chance of winning and acceptable risk.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus was on the potential for a higher win and the risk of ending up with nothing, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery: 20% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential winnings (Gewinnmarge) between the two lotteries and the risk of ending up with 0 Euros from Lottery A, specifically mentioning the 20% probability of this outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the difference in potential winnings was not large enough to risk ending up with nothing, and they found the 20% chance of getting nothing to be significant, leading them to prefer a sure, albeit smaller, gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the 20% chance of getting 0 Euros from Lottery A. However, the decision reason specifically compares the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between the two lotteries, and while the individual discusses the risk associated with Lottery A, they do not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between Lottery A and Lottery B in their justification.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B since its minimum outcome has a 100% probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on avoiding the risk of the 0 Euro outcome and preferring a sure gain, which indirectly aligns with preferring the higher probability of a non-zero minimum outcome but does not directly state a comparison of the minimum outcome probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
The individual's focus on the risk of the minimum outcome and their preference for a sure gain over a potentially higher but riskier outcome suggest an alignment with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. However, the individual does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between the two lotteries in their verbal report, which introduces some uncertainty about whether they directly applied the decision reason as stated."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) for both lotteries. This information is: Lottery A has a 75% chance of the minimum outcome, and Lottery B has an 80% chance of the minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in probabilities (mentioned as ""5%"") and the preference for the higher sum, also considering the worst-case scenario as neutral.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the preference for the higher sum and the perception that the difference in probabilities is not significant, also considering the neutrality of the worst-case scenario.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B), but the individual's consideration of probabilities seems to be about the difference in winning probabilities (implied by ""5%"") rather than the probabilities of the minimum outcomes directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for the higher sum and the perceived insignificance of the probability difference, not explicitly mentioning the preference for the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the higher sum and the perceived difference in probabilities, along with the mention of the worst-case scenario being neutral, does not align with the decision reason that specifically considers the probability of the minimum outcome to make a choice. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision."
5,"6000 auch sehr hoch mit 45%. Zudem habe ich kein Problem damit, 0 zu riskieren.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for this reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a probability of 55%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (Gewinnsumme) between the two lotteries as significant. They also noted the probability of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B as high, at 45%. Additionally, the individual mentioned having no issue with risking 0 Euros, implying comfort with the possibility of not winning. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the potential high reward and the individual's risk tolerance rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (difference in potential winnings, probability of the higher reward, and risk tolerance), it appears there is a mismatch. The decision reason specifically looks at the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), preferring the lottery with the higher probability of this outcome, which would be Lottery B with 55%. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) between the two lotteries. Instead, the focus was on the potential high reward and the individual's comfort with risk. Thus, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome) does not directly align with the individual's stated justification for their choice.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For both lotteries, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. In Lottery A, the probability of this outcome is 99.9%, and in Lottery B, it's 99.8%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher probability (99.9% vs 99.8%) of the minimum outcome (0 Euros). The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered both gains as extremely unlikely but thought that if they were to have luck, they would rather have the higher sum.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification seems to be based on the preference for a higher gain if luck were to occur, not directly on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the decision-making process. The individual focused on the unlikeliness of the gains and the preference for a higher sum if they were to win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (preferring a higher sum if they were to have luck). The individual's reasoning does not indicate a consideration of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the basis for their choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the probabilities of the minimum outcomes or used the decision reason's rule to make their choice. The focus was on the preference for a higher gain if they were to win, not on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with an 80% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The key information is:
- Lottery A: -4000 Euros at 80% probability
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros at 100% probability

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of the loss in Lottery B, comparing it to the potential loss in Lottery A, noting that the loss in A is larger but also mentioning the aspect of risk and the maximum outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery A, which they found to be not worth the risk.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by preferring the certain but smaller loss of Lottery B over the risky and potentially larger loss of Lottery A, highlighting the unattractiveness of the risk associated with Lottery A and the preference for a certain outcome, even if it means a guaranteed loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, but the individual's consideration seems to weigh more heavily on the certainty of the loss and the size of the potential loss, rather than strictly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B since its minimum outcome has a 100% probability. The individual's justification also leads to the selection of Lottery B, but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the basis for the decision. Instead, it emphasizes the preference for a certain outcome over a risky one and the relative sizes of the losses.

Given these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual seems to prioritize the certainty and size of the loss, which indirectly leads to the same choice the decision reason would suggest but through a different thought process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's preference, the verbal report suggests that the decision was made based on different considerations, primarily the certainty of the outcome and the size of the potential loss, rather than the probability of the minimum outcome as specified by the decision reason."
8,"dann lieber etwas weniger Geld verlieren würde, wenn ich schon so wahrscheinlich verlieren werde.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 20% probability, and in Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 25% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which can be derived as follows:
- Lottery A: 20% chance of losing 4000 Euros
- Lottery B: 25% chance of losing 3000 Euros
This information is relevant to the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the principle that the difference of 5% ( likely referring to the difference in probabilities or outcomes) makes little difference and that they would prefer to lose less money if they are likely to lose anyway. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on the preference to lose less money when loss is highly probable, implying a consideration of both the magnitude of loss and its probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the probability of losing and the amount of loss. However, the individual seems to weigh both the probability and the magnitude of the loss, not solely the probability of the minimum outcome as the decision reason suggests.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, whereas the individual prefers the lottery where they lose less if they are likely to lose, which suggests a consideration of the expected loss or a risk-averse strategy rather than strictly following the probability of the minimum outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason that prefers the lottery based solely on the higher probability of the minimum outcome. However, there are elements in the verbal report that suggest some alignment with considering probabilities and outcomes, but not in the specific manner the decision reason dictates.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 45% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which is 45% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the risk of losing a significant amount at once and compares the two lotteries based on this risk. They seem to focus on the potential loss and the likelihood of that loss happening.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by stating a preference for the ""geringere Übel"" (lesser evil), implying they chose the option that seemed less bad or risky to them, specifically mentioning the high probability of losing a certain amount as a factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the risk (probability) of losing a significant amount.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case (90% probability of -3000 Euros). The individual's justification also leads them to choose Lottery B, citing the preference for the lesser evil due to the high probability of a specific loss, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the higher probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's verbal report closely aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome and the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of that outcome. The language used, such as ""geringere Übel"" and the consideration of the risk of significant loss, suggests that the individual's decision-making process was guided by a similar principle to the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was used by the individual."
10,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 0.2%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 0.1%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher probability (0.2%) of its minimum outcome (-3000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0.1% for -6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of losses in both lotteries and had difficulty assessing the difference that 0.01% makes. They seemed to focus on the high probability of not losing (99.99% for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because they felt it was safer (getting ""auf Nummer sicher""), implying they were trying to avoid the loss, and believed the low probability of loss made it unlikely to happen.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned as a consideration in the verbal report. The individual instead talks about the overall low probabilities of loss and the feeling of safety with Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher probability of the minimum outcome, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a perceived safety and low probability of loss, not explicitly considering the comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the decision reason would.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment is based on the fact that the individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. Instead, the individual's choice seems to be influenced by a general perception of risk and safety, without directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 50% probability
- Lottery A: 500 Euros with 100% probability
This information suggests that the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual seems to be focusing on the potential gain and the risk of not trying for a higher amount. They mention the possibility of doubling their gain (which could imply they are considering the 1000 Euros outcome of Lottery B) and the feeling of not having tried for more if they only get 500 Euros. This implies they are weighing the potential benefits and the risks involved in their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice by expressing a willingness to risk not gaining more (thus potentially staying at the same level) rather than settling for a guaranteed 500 Euros without trying for more. This suggests their decision is influenced by the desire to attempt to achieve a higher gain and the emotional aspect of not regretting the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is 50% for Lottery B (0 Euros) and 100% for Lottery A (500 Euros). The individual's consideration seems more focused on the upside potential and the emotional aspect of their decision rather than explicitly on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (100% chance of 500 Euros). The individual's justification, however, revolves around the potential for a higher gain and the emotional aspect of trying for more, not directly mentioning the preference for a higher probability of a minimum outcome.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's decision process as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is based on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for their choice. The individual seems more influenced by the potential for a higher gain and emotional factors rather than the specific probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome of one option (-500 Euros with 100% probability for Lottery A) and the risk associated with the other option (50% chance of losing -1000 Euros for Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the dislike of the 50% chance of a significant loss in Lottery B, especially since neither option offered a gain. The individual seems to value the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A over the gamble in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the certainty of the -500 Euros outcome in Lottery A and the risk of the -1000 Euros outcome in Lottery B. However, the individual's reasoning seems more focused on the avoidance of risk rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A because its minimum outcome has a 100% probability. The individual's justification implies a preference for Lottery A due to its certainty and the avoidance of a significant potential loss, which indirectly aligns with preferring a higher probability of a less severe minimum outcome but does not explicitly state this rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's reasoning process, as described, aligns with the decision reason to some extent, particularly in preferring the lottery with the more certain (and less severe in terms of financial loss) minimum outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the basis for the decision, which introduces some uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied. Therefore, while there is a degree of alignment, it is not a perfect match, leading to an assessment that is somewhat above the midpoint but not at certainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a probability of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) for each lottery: 75% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of having a chance to win something versus the risk of getting nothing. Specifically, they mentioned the 50% probability of ""mit plus davonzugehen"" (going away with a plus), implying a focus on not ending up with nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is that they prefer a greater chance of winning something over the risk of getting nothing, even if the other potential gain might be higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 75% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considered the aspect of having a chance to win something, which aligns with preferring a lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), but their focus seems to be more on the positive aspect of winning something rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (75% chance of 0 Euros). However, the individual's justification seems to align more with preferring a lower risk of getting nothing, which would intuitively suggest preferring Lottery B because it offers outcomes where you can ""go away with a plus"" with a higher combined probability than Lottery A's single high reward. The individual's statement about preferring a greater chance of winning something could be interpreted as aligning with the logic of minimizing the risk of getting nothing, but it does not directly address the comparison of the minimum outcome probabilities as the decision reason does.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. While the individual expresses a preference for minimizing the risk of getting nothing, this does not directly translate to preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, also with a 25% probability. However, since the reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, we note that both lotteries have their worst outcomes with the same probability (25%). But, considering the structure of the reason, it's more about comparing the worst-case scenario probabilities. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the worst outcome in each lottery, which is 25% for both, but since Lottery B also has a -2000 Euros outcome with 25% probability, which is better than the worst outcome of A, the comparison isn't straightforward based solely on the description of the reason. However, the key point is the probability of the minimum (worst) outcome, which is directly comparable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing something in both lotteries, specifically mentioning a ""50% Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit"" (50% probability of loss) for Lottery B, which seems to be a misunderstanding since the 50% probability in B is for the 0 Euros outcome, not the loss. However, the focus on loss probability indicates they were considering the risk of losing.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because they felt it was less likely to result in a loss (""es kam es bei A deutlich unwahrscheinlicher vor, etwas zu verlieren""), and they had an unfavorable feeling about the 50% loss probability they perceived in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in how the probabilities were interpreted, especially for Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, but the individual's justification seems to be based on a perceived lower likelihood of loss in A and an aversion to the perceived higher loss probability in B, not directly on comparing the probabilities of the worst outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with a concern about loss probabilities but does not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The individual misinterprets the probabilities and focuses on the general likelihood of loss rather than the specific probability of the minimum outcome as per the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered aspects related to loss probabilities, their reasoning did not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes. The individual's misunderstanding of the probabilities in Lottery B and their focus on a general sense of loss likelihood rather than the specific probabilities of the worst outcomes as defined by the decision reason lead to this conclusion."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a probability of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a higher probability (100%) of its minimum outcome (5 Euros) compared to Lottery A, which has a 99.9% probability of its minimum outcome (0 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers having a secure win as a positive aspect and views the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery A as not particularly bad. However, they express a preference for a certain gain over a potential, less certain one, referencing the German proverb ""lieber den Spatz in der Hand als die Taube auf dem Dach,"" which translates to ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"" indicating a preference for a certain, smaller reward over a potential, larger one that is less secure.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification revolves around the desire for a secure win and the preference for certainty, as indicated by the proverb.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of securing a win and their view on the certainty of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which in this case is Lottery B. The individual's justification emphasizes the value of a secure gain, which also points towards preferring Lottery B, aligning with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on securing a certain gain and their preference for the ""bird in the hand"" suggests an alignment with the decision reason's emphasis on the probability of the minimum outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes between the two lotteries, which introduces some uncertainty.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. Since we can derive the necessary information (minimum outcomes and their probabilities) from the lotteries, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a minimum outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B has a minimum outcome of -5000 Euros with 0.1% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the aspect of a certain loss in Lottery A and the relatively low probability of a high loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the dislike for accepting a certain loss (in Lottery A) and viewing the risk of a high loss in Lottery B as relatively low, which led them to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. The individual considered the certainty of loss in Lottery A and the low probability of a significant loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of these outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification does not explicitly state a preference based on the probability of the minimum outcome but rather on the acceptance of risk versus certain loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. While the individual considered aspects related to the minimum outcomes (certain loss in A, low probability of a high loss in B), their justification does not explicitly match the decision reason's criteria. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 50% probability of -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 100% probability of 1500 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the attractiveness of the certain gain offered by Lottery B and compared the potential loss of Lottery A to the potential gain of Lottery B, finding the risk of losing twice what could be gained in B too high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified the choice by preferring a certain, smaller gain over the risk of losing more than could be gained, indicating a preference for avoiding significant losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certain gain of B and the risk of loss in A but did not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred the certain gain, which aligns with preferring a higher probability of a non-negative outcome but does not directly address the comparison of minimum outcome probabilities.

Considering these comparisons, the individual's reasoning seems to align more with risk aversion and a preference for certainty rather than explicitly comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as the decision reason dictates. However, the decision reason's core aspect—preferring the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome probability—is somewhat reflected in the individual's preference for the certain gain over the risk of a significant loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment indicates that while there are elements of the individual's decision-making process that align with the decision reason (such as preferring a certain gain over a risky option with potential for significant loss), the explicit consideration and comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as required by the decision reason are not clearly evident in the verbal report. Therefore, it is more likely that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability.
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 100% probability (since it's a certain outcome).
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities: 
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of its minimum outcome (-3000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of its minimum outcome (2000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the sum of the potential loss in Lottery A to be too high and also mentioned the chance of this loss. They found 2000 Euros to be a good gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the high potential loss and its probability in Lottery A and the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the chance of the high loss in Lottery A. However, the individual also mentions the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery B, which is not directly related to comparing the probabilities of minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification, while mentioning the probability of loss, does not explicitly compare the probabilities of the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries but rather focuses on the aversiveness of the potential loss in Lottery A and the desirability of the gain in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of the high loss in Lottery A and the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery B suggests some alignment with considering outcomes and their probabilities, but the decision reason specifically about preferring the higher probability of the minimum outcome is not clearly reflected in the verbal report. The individual's justification seems more driven by risk aversion and the appeal of a certain gain rather than a direct comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes as specified by the decision reason."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A's minimum outcome and 100% for Lottery B's minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the principle of ""a bird in the hand"" (Spatzen in der Hand), indicating a preference for a certain gain over a potentially higher but uncertain gain. They also found the potential gain in Lottery A attractive but were not willing to risk a high loss with a high probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the risk of a high loss and the attractiveness of a certain gain, implying they considered the potential outcomes and their probabilities in making their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did consider the potential for loss and gain, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the risk of a high loss and the value of a certain gain), there is a conceptual alignment. The individual's preference for avoiding a high loss with a significant probability can be interpreted as valuing the certainty of a positive outcome (Lottery B's 100% chance of 1000 Euros) over the gamble with a significant risk of a high loss (Lottery A), which indirectly suggests a consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's verbal report suggests they considered the risk of loss and the value of a certain gain, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. While the report does not directly state the individual used the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, the emphasis on avoiding a high loss and valuing certainty implies a similar line of reasoning. Therefore, it is likely, but not certain, that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 50%. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 100%. 
Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a higher probability (100%) of its minimum outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B (50% for -6000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a high sum of money (6000 Euros) with a 50% probability. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating they have no problem staying with the current sum (implying 0 Euros, or no gain/no loss, is acceptable) and considered the risk of losing a high sum too risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, while the individual considered the risk of a significant loss, which aligns with considering outcomes but is specifically focused on the negative aspect rather than the probability of the minimum outcome per se. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A (100% chance of 0 Euros). The individual's justification implies a preference for avoiding risk, which aligns with choosing Lottery A but does not explicitly mention the probability of the minimum outcome as the deciding factor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision and justification align with the outcome preferred by the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of the minimum outcome, which is Lottery A), the explicit consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome as stated in the decision reason is not clearly articulated in the verbal report. The individual's focus on risk avoidance and acceptance of the status quo (0 Euros) suggests an alignment with the decision reason's preference but does not perfectly match the reason's specific criteria."
