probability sensitivity
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Evaluate the lotteries based on the relevant probabilities of favorable outcomes. 
Lottery A has the outcomes with respective probabilities: 
- 2500 Euros with 33% probability,
- 2400 Euros with 66% probability,
- 0 Euros with 1% probability.

The favorable outcomes (2500 Euros and 2400 Euros) yield a probability of receiving something positive in Lottery A combined as 33% + 66% = 99%.

Lottery B presents 2400 Euros with 100% probability, which means there is certainty of receiving a positive outcome. 

Step 1 summary:
- Lottery A favorable outcomes total probability = 99%.
- Lottery B favorable outcome probability = 100% with certainty.

Since relevant information about the probabilities can be derived, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to determine preference based on favorable outcomes.
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Comparing the probabilities:
- Lottery A has a 99% probability of getting a favorable outcome.
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of getting a favorable outcome.

Since Lottery B has a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (100%) compared to Lottery A (99%), according to the decision reason provided, Lottery B is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Evaluate the probabilities of each lottery: 
   - Lottery A: 33% chance of winning 2500 Euros and a 67% chance of winning 0 Euros.
   - Lottery B: 34% chance of winning 2400 Euros and a 66% chance of winning 0 Euros.

2. Identify the key factor from the decision reason: 
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Here, the favorable outcomes are winning the respective amounts offered by both lotteries (2500 Euros for A and 2400 Euros for B).

3. Compare the probabilities:
   - Lottery A has a 33% probability of winning 2500 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a 34% probability of winning 2400 Euros.
   - Since Lottery B has a higher probability (34%) compared to Lottery A (33%) for a favorable outcome, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Evaluate the probabilities of each lottery. For Lottery A, there is an 80% probability of winning 4000 Euros, and a 20% probability of winning nothing. For Lottery B, there is a 100% probability of winning 3000 Euros. The relevant probabilities for comparison are 80% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B. Since we can derive the relevant information, we will proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A has a probability of 80% for obtaining a favorable outcome (4000 Euros), while Lottery B has a 100% probability for obtaining a favorable outcome (3000 Euros). Since 100% (Lottery B) is greater than 80% (Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the probabilities of favorable outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery A, there is a 20% probability of receiving 4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, there is a 25% probability of receiving 3000 Euros. The relevant information derived from the probabilities is:
- Lottery A: 20% chance of 4000 Euros
- Lottery B: 25% chance of 3000 Euros

Since the probabilities can be directly compared, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A has a 20% probability and Lottery B has a 25% probability of obtaining favorable outcomes. Since 25% (Lottery B) is greater than 20% (Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the relevant information from the lotteries:
- Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with a 45% probability and 0 Euros with a 55% probability.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros with a 90% probability and 0 Euros with a 10% probability.
The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of favorable outcomes. Here, the favorable outcomes are the monetary amounts. Lottery A has a 45% probability of receiving 6000 Euros, while Lottery B has a 90% probability of receiving 3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Apply the decision reason:
- Lottery A has a 45% chance for a higher monetary outcome (6000 Euros) 
- Lottery B has a 90% chance for a lower monetary outcome (3000 Euros)

The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Comparing the probabilities of receiving any monetary gain, Lottery B has a significantly higher chance (90%) of yielding a favorable outcome compared to Lottery A (45%). 

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Summarizing the relevant information about the lotteries:
- For Lottery A: 
   - Probability of winning 6000 Euros: 0.1%
   - Probability of winning 0 Euros: 99.9%
  
- For Lottery B: 
   - Probability of winning 3000 Euros: 0.2%
   - Probability of winning 0 Euros: 99.8%

Step 2: Applying the decision reason:
The decision reason indicates that the preference is based on the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A has a 0.1% chance of winning 6000 Euros, while Lottery B has a 0.2% chance of winning 3000 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (0.2% vs. 0.1%), it is preferred according to the decision reason.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assessing the decision reason against the lotteries, we summarize the relevant probabilities:
- For Lottery A, the chances of losing 4000 Euros are 80%, and the chances of winning 0 Euros are 20%. This indicates that the loss leading to a more probable outcome is substantial.
- For Lottery B, there is a 100% probability of losing 3000 Euros. 

The decision reason is focused on the probabilities and prefers a lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Thus, we can evaluate the favorable outcomes:
- Lottery A's favorable outcome (winning 0 Euros) occurs with a probability of 20%.
- Lottery B's favorable outcome (not losing anything, as it guarantees a loss of 3000 Euros) is 0%, since the outcome is always negative.

Since we can derive the probabilities and they're relevant to the decision reason, we move to Step 2.

Step 2: Applying the decision reason, we see that Lottery A has a 20% chance of a less unfavorable outcome (0 Euros) compared to Lottery B's 0% chance of a more favorable outcome (0 Euros). Hence, Lottery A has a higher probability of obtaining a less negative outcome compared to B. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Analyze the lotteries: 
- Lottery A offers -4000 Euros with a probability of 20% and 0 Euros with a probability of 80%. 
- Lottery B offers -3000 Euros with a probability of 25% and 0 Euros with a probability of 75%. 
The favorable outcome (0 Euros) has a higher probability in both lotteries, but we need to compare the differences in probabilities of the favorable outcomes (0 Euros) versus the unfavorable outcomes (-4000 Euros for A and -3000 Euros for B).

Now we summarize:
- For Lottery A: 0 Euros (favorable outcome) has a probability of 80%.
- For Lottery B: 0 Euros (favorable outcome) has a probability of 75%.
  
Step 2: Apply the decision reason: 
The decision reason states to prefer the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A has a probability of 80% for the favorable outcome, while Lottery B has a probability of 75%. Therefore, according to the decision reason, Lottery A is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries:
- Lottery A offers -6000 Euros with a 45% probability and 0 Euros with a 55% probability. 
- Lottery B offers -3000 Euros with a 90% probability and 0 Euros with a 10% probability.
The relevant information is the probabilities of the favorable outcomes (0 Euros) and the unfavorable outcomes (-6000 Euros for A and -3000 Euros for B). The decision reason focuses on the probabilities associated with the outcomes.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason:
- For Lottery A: The probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (0 Euros) is 55%.
- For Lottery B: The probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (0 Euros) is 10%.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Since 55% (Lottery A) is greater than 10% (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess the probabilities of winning (favorable outcome) for each lottery:
   - For Lottery A: the favorable outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%.
   - For Lottery B: the favorable outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a slightly lower probability of 99.8%.

2. Next, determine which lottery has a higher probability of the favorable outcome:
   - Lottery A has a higher probability (99.9%) compared to Lottery B (99.8%) for the outcome of 0 Euros.

3. According to the decision reason, which prioritizes the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome, we find that Lottery A is preferred due to its better probability.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Examine the lotteries' probabilities. 
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of winning 1000 Euros and a 50% probability of winning 0 Euros. 
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of winning 500 Euros. 
The relevant probabilities are 50% for Lottery A and 100% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason based on the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 
- Lottery A has a 50% chance of winning 1000 Euros, which is favorable, but it also has a 50% chance of winning nothing. 
- Lottery B offers a 100% chance of winning 500 Euros, which is entirely favorable. 
Since Lottery B has a higher probability (100%) of obtaining a favorable outcome (500 Euros), compared to Lottery A's 50%, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the information from the lotteries:
   - Lottery A has a 50% probability of winning 0 Euros and a 50% probability of losing 1000 Euros. 
     This means the expected outcome can be calculated as follows: 
     (0 Euros * 0.5) + (-1000 Euros * 0.5) = -500 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a 100% probability of losing 500 Euros. 
     The expected outcome for Lottery B is simply -500 Euros.
   
   Both lotteries have the same expected outcome of -500 Euros, but the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome are different. Lottery A has a 50% chance of not losing any money (0 Euros), while Lottery B guarantees a loss of 500 Euros with 100% certainty.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   As the decision reason states it prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome, we need to compare the favorable outcomes. 
   Lottery A provides a 50% chance of obtaining 0 Euros (not losing any money), while Lottery B guarantees a -500 Euros outcome with a 0% probability of obtaining a more favorable outcome. 
   Therefore, the preference should lean towards Lottery A, which provides a non-negative outcome with a higher probability compared to the certain loss in Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the relevant information from both lotteries regarding their probabilities of favorable outcomes. 
   - Lottery A offers a favorable outcome of 6000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros (unfavorable) with a 75% probability.
   - Lottery B offers multiple outcomes: 4000 Euros with a 25% probability, 2000 Euros with a 25% probability, and 0 Euros with a 50% probability. 

2. Identify the probabilities for favorable outcomes:
   - For Lottery A, the only favorable outcome (6000 Euros) has a probability of 25%.
   - For Lottery B, both 4000 Euros (25% probability) and 2000 Euros (25% probability) are considered favorable outcomes, totaling a 50% probability of receiving a favorable outcome (either 4000 Euros or 2000 Euros).

3. Based on the decision reason which states that it prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome, we compare the probabilities:
   - Lottery A has a 25% probability of a favorable outcome.
   - Lottery B has a 50% probability of a favorable outcome.

4. Since Lottery B has a higher probability (50%) of obtaining a favorable outcome compared to Lottery A (25%), according to the decision reason, it clearly prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries based on their probabilities and outcomes.
- Lottery A: Offers 6000 Euros with a 25% probability and 0 Euros with a 75% probability.
- Lottery B: Offers -4000 Euros with a 25% probability, -2000 Euros with a 25% probability, and 0 Euros with a 50% probability.

Favorable outcomes for each lottery:
- For Lottery A, the favorable outcome is 6000 Euros occurring with a probability of 25%.
- For Lottery B, the favorable outcomes are -2000 Euros (which is less favorable than 0) and 0 Euros. 

When considering the favorable outcomes:
- Lottery A has a 25% chance of receiving a favorable outcome of 6000 Euros.
- Lottery B, although it does have an outcome of 0 Euros (the same outcome as Lottery A's 0 Euros), it also has probabilities of losing money (-4000 Euros and -2000 Euros), which are less favorable.

The probabilities of reaching a better outcome (0 Euros or positive) are as follows:
- Lottery A: 75% chance of achieving 0 Euros or better.
- Lottery B: 50% chance of achieving 0 Euros or better.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason based on the emphasis on the probabilities. 
The decision reason states that it prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A offers a better probability of achieving a non-negative outcome (0 Euros or higher) at 75%, compared to Lottery B's 50%.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the information in the lotteries. 
- Lottery A has a 0.1% probability of winning 5000 Euros and a 99.9% probability of winning 0 Euros.
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of winning 5 Euros. 
The relevant information is the probabilities of obtaining a favorable outcome. 

Step 2: Apply the decision reason.
- The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 
- Comparing the probabilities: Lottery A has a favorable outcome of 5000 Euros which occurs at a probability of 0.1%, while Lottery B guarantees a favorable outcome of 5 Euros at a probability of 100%.
- Since 100% (Lottery B) is greater than 0.1% (Lottery A), Lottery B is preferred according to the decision reason.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the relevant information from the lotteries. 
- Lottery A offers -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. Hence, the favorable outcome (0 Euros) has a high probability (99.9%).
- Lottery B offers -5 Euros with a 100% probability, which is also considered a negative outcome but is less severe than -5000 Euros. 
The relevant probabilities are:
- Probability of favorable outcome for A (0 Euros) = 99.9%
- Probability of negative outcome for A (-5000 Euros) = 0.1%
- Probability of negative outcome for B (-5 Euros) = 100%

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem. 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. 
- Lottery A has a very high probability (99.9%) of obtaining the favorable outcome of 0 Euros, while in Lottery B, the only outcome is -5 Euros (which is negative) but has 100% probability. 
- Since the decision reason emphasizes the higher probability of a favorable outcome and Lottery A has a much better favorable outcome in terms of fewer losses, it is preferred.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the lotteries. 
Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 50% probability and -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. The favorable outcome in this case is the positive gain of 3000 Euros, which has a 50% probability. 
Lottery B offers 1500 Euros with a 100% probability. The favorable outcome here is the 1500 Euros, which has a 100% probability. 

Step 2: Apply the decision reason. 
The decision reason specifies that it prefers the lottery with a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery A gives a favorable outcome (3000 Euros) with a 50% probability, while Lottery B gives a favorable outcome (1500 Euros) with a 100% probability.
Since Lottery B has a higher probability (100%) of obtaining its favorable outcome than Lottery A (50%), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the probabilities of the outcomes for both lotteries. Lottery A has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with a 50% probability and -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. Lottery B has only one outcome: 2000 Euros with a 100% probability. Evaluating the probabilities, Lottery A has a chance of 50% to win a favorable outcome (3000 Euros) and 50% chance to incur a loss (-3000 Euros), while Lottery B guarantees a favorable outcome (2000 Euros) with 100% probability. Since the decision reason can be applied based on the importance of probabilities and the relevant information can be derived, we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason’s rule. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome. Lottery B offers a 100% probability of obtaining a favorable outcome (2000 Euros) while Lottery A only provides a 50% probability for a favorable outcome (3000 Euros). Thus, Lottery B has a higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome compared to Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries. Lottery A has a 50% probability of winning 3000 Euros (favorable outcome) and a 50% probability of losing 3000 Euros (unfavorable outcome). Lottery B has a 100% probability of winning 1000 Euros (favorable outcome). Hence, the relevant information regarding favorable outcomes is that Lottery A has a 50% chance of a higher payout (3000 Euros) but also has an equal 50% chance of a negative payout, whereas Lottery B guarantees a 1000 Euros payout with certainty.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason considering the probabilities. The decision reason prioritizes the lottery with the higher probability of a favorable outcome. Lottery B offers a 100% probability of a favorable outcome (winning 1000 Euros), while Lottery A only offers a 50% probability of a favorable outcome (winning 3000 Euros). Therefore, based on the decision reason which values higher probabilities, Lottery B is preferred as it guarantees a favorable outcome.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
"STEPS: 
Step 1: 
Assess the relevant information:
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 6000 Euros (50% probability) and -6000 Euros (50% probability). 
- Lottery B has one outcome: 0 Euros (100% probability). 

The favorable outcome for Lottery A is 6000 Euros with a probability of 50%. For Lottery B, the favorable outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 100%. 

This information allows us to evaluate the probabilities of favorable outcomes directly and is relevant to the decision reason.

Step 2: 
Apply the decision reason's rule:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of obtaining a favorable outcome:
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of a favorable outcome (6000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 100% probability of a favorable outcome (0 Euros).

Since the probability of a favorable outcome in Lottery B (100%) is higher than that in Lottery A (50%), we conclude that the decision reason prefers Lottery B over Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: B"
