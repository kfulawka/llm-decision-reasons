STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66% and the minimum probability is 1%, resulting in a difference of 65%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B because it has the smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (65%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of a high win, which seems to be a consideration in their decision-making process. They mention ""99,9%"" which does not directly match the probabilities given in either lottery but suggests they are focusing on the likelihood of winning a significant amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Variant A because of the high probability of a win, as they perceive it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, talks about the probability of a high win without mentioning the spread of probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its smaller difference in probabilities. The individual, however, chooses Lottery A based on their perception of a high win probability, not the spread of probabilities.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focuses on the probability of winning a high amount rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (associated with the 0 Euros outcome, but the probability is explicitly given as 67% for this outcome, implying the 33% is the probability for the 2500 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 67% (since 67% is the probability of the 0 Euros outcome, which is higher than the 33% for the 2500 Euros outcome). However, the correct interpretation seems to be about comparing the range of probabilities within each lottery, which in this case would be the difference between the probability of winning and the probability of not winning for each lottery. Therefore, for Lottery A, the difference is 67% - 33% = 34%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (similarly, the probability for the 0 Euros outcome is given as 66%, implying the 34% is for the 2400 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 66%, leading to a difference of 66% - 34% = 32%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probabilities for each lottery: 34% for Lottery A and 32% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is the probability of getting 0 Euros, which was noted to be ""something lower"" (etwas geringer) for Variant B compared to the implicit comparison with Variant A. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to focus on the comparative likelihood of avoiding the 0 Euros outcome, implying a consideration of the probabilities associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities between the outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the comparative likelihood of getting 0 Euros), it appears the individual considered the probabilities but not explicitly the differences between the maximum and minimum probabilities of each lottery as the decision reason dictates.
Second, the decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 32% difference compared to Lottery A’s 34% difference. The individual's justification, however, focuses on the lower probability of getting 0 Euros with Lottery B, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but does not directly mention or imply a consideration of the range of probabilities within each lottery as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the comparative probabilities of avoiding the 0 Euros outcome aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (preferring Lottery B) but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific consideration of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery. Thus, while there's a superficial alignment in the choice, the underlying reasoning process described does not clearly match the decision reason's criteria, leading to a low assessment score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences for each lottery, which are 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring to take 3000 Euros rather than nothing, indicating they considered the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B and the possibility of getting nothing from Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the preference for a guaranteed amount over the risk of getting nothing, which suggests they considered the outcomes and possibly the risks associated with each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration, as expressed, focuses on the outcomes (guaranteed money vs. the possibility of nothing), not directly on the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the preference for a guaranteed amount, which aligns with the outcome of Lottery B being preferable under the decision reason but does not explicitly mention considering the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. The individual's focus was on the guaranteed outcome versus the risk of getting nothing, which is a different consideration than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice matches what the decision reason would prefer, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason (considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) was directly used in making the decision. The individual's justification is more aligned with risk aversion or a preference for certainty rather than the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 20%, resulting in a difference of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher probability sum (25%) and the higher amount of money.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the higher probability sum because the chances are higher. The individual seems to focus on the probability of winning rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the comparison of the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probability of winning (25% for Lottery A) rather than the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on the higher probability of winning, not on the comparison of these differences.
Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision, as the focus was on the probability of winning rather than on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 55% probability, which can be considered as a minimum outcome with a probability) and the maximum probability is 45% (for 6000 Euros). However, the minimum probability in the context of the decision reason seems to refer to the lowest probability of any outcome, which in both lotteries is 0% for the outcome of 0 Euros, and the maximum probability refers to the highest probability of any non-zero outcome. Thus, for Lottery A, the difference is 45% - 55% = -10% if considering the probabilities of the two outcomes directly, but since the reason likely intends to compare the range of probabilities for non-zero outcomes to zero-outcome probabilities, it's more logical to consider the difference as being between the probability of the non-zero outcome and the implicit 0% minimum for a non-existent lower outcome, which doesn't apply directly here. For Lottery B, the minimum probability (for a non-zero outcome) is 90%, and the maximum is also 90% since there's only one non-zero outcome. Thus, the difference for Lottery B is 0%. However, interpreting the decision reason to fit the given lotteries, we consider the difference between the highest probability of a non-zero payout and the lowest probability of any payout (which would be the 0 Euro outcome's probability in both cases). Therefore, the relevant calculation under this corrected understanding for Lottery A is 45% (probability of the non-zero outcome) and 55% (probability of the zero outcome), indicating a misunderstanding in the initial calculation. The correct approach to apply the decision reason is to consider the difference between the probabilities of winning and losing in each lottery: For Lottery A, the difference is |45% - 55%| = 10%, and for Lottery B, it's |90% - 10%| = 80%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher probability of winning (receiving money) in one of the variants compared to the other.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of receiving money, which implies a focus on the likelihood of the positive outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which doesn't directly align with the individual's focus on the higher probability of receiving money.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, whereas the individual's justification is about the higher probability of winning, not directly about comparing the differences in probabilities between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's focus is on the probability of winning (receiving money), which does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the probabilities of outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 6000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.1%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.2%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but noted that winning in Lottery A would result in double the amount compared to winning in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, despite the low probability of winning, the potential gain was twice as much as in Lottery B if a win occurred.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was on the potential gain and the fact that winning was highly unlikely in both cases, not explicitly on the differences in probabilities between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with a 0.1% difference. However, the individual's justification was based on the potential gain being double in Lottery A, not the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The focus was more on the outcome values rather than the probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it suggests that Lottery B would be preferred according to this reason because it has the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high probability of losing more money with Lottery A, indicating they considered the probabilities associated with the outcomes of Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the probability of losing more money (implied to be the higher loss of -4000 Euros) is very high in Lottery A. This suggests the individual was concerned about the risk or the potential for a significant loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which doesn't directly align with the individual's concern about the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery A. The individual does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between its minimum and maximum probability, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. The individual also chooses Lottery B but justifies it based on the high risk of a significant loss in Lottery A, not explicitly on the basis of comparing the probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the justification provided in the verbal report does not directly reflect the decision reason's focus on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's reasoning seems to be more about risk aversion regarding the potential significant loss rather than the specific probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice matches the outcome of applying the decision reason, the verbal report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for the choice. The justification provided focuses on risk aversion rather than the comparison of probability ranges, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary factor in the individual's decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for -4000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for -3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 80% bei 0 zu bleiben,"" which translates to ""Higher probability of 80% to stay at 0."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of not losing any money (staying at 0 Euros) in one of the lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report implies that the individual focused on the higher probability of not incurring a loss (0 Euros), which is the outcome with 80% probability in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences in probabilities between the outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the higher probability of staying at 0 Euros). The individual's consideration does not directly align with calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery but focuses on the specific probability of avoiding loss.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the higher probability of not losing). The decision reason's rule is about comparing the range of probabilities between lotteries, while the individual's justification is about selecting the option with a higher probability of a specific outcome (0 Euros), not directly about comparing the probability ranges.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 90% and 10%, giving a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 55% and 45%, resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery (80% for A and 10% for B).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of getting 0 Euros, noting it is over 50%. This implies they considered the probability aspect of at least one of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is incomplete in the report, but it starts to discuss the probability of getting 0 Euros, which is a component of the decision problem.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's consideration of the probability of getting 0 Euros (which is part of the probability distribution of each lottery) is related but does not directly indicate they compared the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, as provided, does not explicitly mention comparing these differences or preferring a lottery based on this criterion.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's specific rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities. The verbal report hints at a consideration of probabilities but does not clearly indicate the use of the specific decision reason provided.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as there's no outcome with a probability less than 99.8%) and the maximum probability is 99.8%, giving a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, giving a difference of 99.8%. Thus, both lotteries have the same difference between their minimum and maximum probabilities. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit mit 0 EURO rauszukommen,"" which translates to ""higher probability of getting out with 0 EURO."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of the 0 Euro outcome in their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the higher probability of not losing (or getting 0 Euros), which is directly related to the probabilities of the lotteries but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, but the individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention this comparison. Instead, the individual focuses on the higher probability of getting 0 Euros.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (99.8%), this reason would lead to indifference. However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule, as they seem to prioritize the higher probability of not losing, which does not directly relate to comparing the ranges of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery or applied the rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between these probabilities. Instead, the focus was on the probability of the 0 Euro outcome, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is thus: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 50%. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the safety of receiving money if they had chosen Lottery B and the potential regret of winning nothing. This indicates they considered the outcomes of both lotteries, specifically the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A and the risk of getting nothing from Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to be based on the emotional aspect of potentially winning nothing and the desire for a safe option, rather than explicitly discussing probabilities or their differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason is based on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration is more about the safety of the outcome and potential regret, not explicitly about probability differences.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities (Lottery A), which aligns with choosing a safer option (as Lottery A is the safe choice here). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention the probability differences or a systematic comparison of such differences between the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's choice might align with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring the safer option, which in this case is Lottery A due to its 0% probability difference), the verbal report does not explicitly indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low certainty that the decision reason was used, as the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, despite the choice potentially being in line with what the reason would suggest. The verbal report lacks explicit mention of comparing probability differences, which is crucial for the decision reason in question."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100%, so the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the probability of ""mehr Geld behalten darf"" (keeping more money), which translates to the probability of a better outcome, focusing on the 50% chance. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decides based on the 50% probability, implying that this probability plays a significant role in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probability of a better outcome), it seems the individual focused more on the presence of a probability rather than the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the 50% probability of a better outcome), there's a discrepancy. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since both have a 0% difference in their minimum and maximum probabilities, but the individual's justification does not reflect this reasoning.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% and the maximum probability is 50% (considering the probabilities given for each outcome). However, to apply the decision reason correctly, we need to identify the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning any amount in each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability of winning is indeed 0% (for the 0 Euros outcome), and the maximum probability is 25% (for the 6000 Euros outcome). For Lottery B, the minimum probability of winning any amount is 25% (for both the 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros outcomes), and the maximum probability among the winning outcomes is also 25%, but since there's a 50% chance of winning nothing, the relevant comparison for the decision reason involves the range from the lowest non-zero probability to the highest probability. Thus, the correct application for Lottery B considers the minimum non-zero probability as 25% and the maximum probability of any single outcome as 50% is not directly relevant but the highest probability of winning (25% for each winning amount) is. The correct interpretation for applying the decision reason should focus on the probabilities of winning outcomes, thus for Lottery A, the difference is 25% (since 25% - 0% = 25%), and for Lottery B, considering the relevant winning outcomes, the difference is 0% (since 25% - 25% = 0%) because both winning outcomes have the same probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the probability and selection (or outcome) were overall higher for Variant B. This suggests the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries but does not specify how they weighed these factors.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by mentioning the higher overall probability and outcome for Variant B, without detailing a specific calculation or comparison method.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning outcomes in each lottery. The individual's report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probabilities between the lotteries in the manner described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability of winning outcomes. The individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, as they mention the overall higher probability and outcome for Variant B without specifying how these probabilities were compared or weighted.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the specific difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of winning outcomes as the basis for their decision, which is what the decision reason requires. The report suggests a consideration of overall probabilities and outcomes but does not match the specific criterion of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, resulting in a difference of 25% (between 50% and 25%). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (25%) between its minimum and maximum probability compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probability of losing a significant amount in each lottery, noting it was less likely to lose as much with Lottery B compared to Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification focuses on the comparative likelihood of significant losses between the two lotteries, suggesting a preference for the option where large losses are less probable.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves comparing the differences in probability ranges between the lotteries, while the individual considered the comparative likelihood of significant losses. These are related but not exactly the same, as the decision reason is more about the probability ranges, and the individual's consideration is about the outcome probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B. The individual's justification also leans towards Lottery B but based on the lower likelihood of significant losses, not explicitly on the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's focus on the likelihood of significant losses and the comparative risk between the two lotteries aligns somewhat with the spirit of considering probabilities, but the verbal report does not directly mention or imply a consideration of the range of probabilities (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability) as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the preference for Lottery B, the reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the high probability (99.9%) of not winning in Lottery A, implying they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B because the high probability of not winning in Lottery A is perceived as ""nahezu unmöglich"" (nearly impossible) or ""unwahrscheinlich"" (improbable), which suggests they are focusing on the likelihood of the outcomes rather than directly comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference in probability ranges, but the individual seems to focus on the perceived improbability of winning in Lottery A rather than explicitly comparing the probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual chooses Lottery B, but their justification is based on the perceived improbability of winning in Lottery A rather than the comparison of probability ranges.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus is more on the practical outcome (receiving 5 Euros for certain vs. the low chance of a larger sum), which indirectly aligns with the decision reason's outcome but not explicitly with its process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason's specific criteria (comparing the differences in probability ranges) were directly considered in making the decision. The justification provided in the report focuses on the practical aspect of the choice rather than the probabilistic comparison the decision reason is based on."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. 
For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, so the difference is 99.8%. 
For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), so the difference is 0%. 
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which is the difference in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""high probability of getting 0 Euros,"" which implies they considered the probability of the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The statement does not directly justify the choice but indicates consideration of the probability of a specific outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires comparing the range of probabilities within each lottery, but the individual's statement focuses on the high probability of a specific outcome in one lottery, not directly comparing the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's statement does not explicitly mention comparing probability ranges or preferring a lottery based on this criterion. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described, but the focus on probability might suggest some indirect consideration. However, the direct application of the decision reason (comparing the difference in probability ranges) is not evident in the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference (0%) between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""sicherer,"" which translates to ""safer"" in English, indicating they considered the safety or certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is that Lottery B is chosen because it is ""sicherer,"" implying the individual preferred the lottery with a guaranteed outcome over the one with variable outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual talks about the safety of the lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose Lottery B because it is safer, not explicitly because of the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on its safety, not on the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is the criterion of the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the decision reason is about comparing these differences to prefer the lottery with the smaller difference, and both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason can technically be applied but it leads to indifference because both lotteries have the same minimum and maximum probability difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Weil es sicherer ist,"" which translates to ""Because it is safer."" This implies the individual considered the safety or certainty of the outcome.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on the perceived safety of the option, which suggests the individual preferred the option that seemed more secure or less risky.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual considered the safety of the options. These are related but distinct, as safety could be inferred from the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which, as established, would not differentiate between the two lotteries. The individual's justification is about safety, which aligns more with the concept of risk aversion rather than the specific rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The final assessment is 0 because the decision reason specifically looks at the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which does not directly align with the individual's stated reason of choosing the safer option. The individual's focus on safety and the decision reason's focus on probability differences do not directly correlate, indicating the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0), the decision reason is indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A (50%) and the guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros in Lottery B (100%). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual questions why they should choose Lottery A, given the risk of losing 3000 Euros, when Lottery B offers a guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros. The individual's deliberation process focuses on the risk associated with Lottery A and the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probability of losing in Lottery A and the guaranteed gain in Lottery B, rather than the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0), the reason is indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on the risk associated with Lottery A and the certainty of Lottery B, which does not align with the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, so the difference is also 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as: both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50% chance of winning a significant amount of money in Lottery B compared to having 0 Euros for sure in Lottery A. They also considered the magnitude of the probability (50%) as ""recht viel"" (quite a lot) in terms of chances.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the option where they have a 50% chance of winning a lot of money over having 0 Euros from the start, emphasizing that 50% is a significant chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned or considered by the individual in their verbal report. The individual's focus is on the presence of a significant chance of winning versus having no chance at all.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule; instead, they prioritize the existence of a significant chance of winning over the certainty of having 0 Euros.
