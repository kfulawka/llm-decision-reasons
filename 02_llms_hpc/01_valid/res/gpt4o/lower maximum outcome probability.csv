lower maximum outcome probability
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
   - The decision reason focuses on the probability of the maximum outcome in each lottery.
   - Identify the maximum outcome and its probability in each lottery.

   Lottery A:
   - Maximum outcome: 2500 Euros
   - Probability of maximum outcome: 33%

   Lottery B:
   - Maximum outcome: 2400 Euros
   - Probability of maximum outcome: 100%

   The relevant information (maximum outcomes and their probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule.
   - Compare the probabilities of the maximum outcomes:
   - Lottery A has a maximum outcome probability of 33%.
   - Lottery B has a maximum outcome probability of 100%.

   According to the decision reason, the lottery with the lower probability of the maximum outcome is preferred.
   - 33% (Lottery A) is lower than 100% (Lottery B).
