STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500, 2400, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Relevant information to the decision reason: 
- Aspiration level: 1825 Euros
- Differences between outcomes and aspiration level for Lottery A: 675, 575, -1825
- Differences between outcomes and aspiration level for Lottery B: 575
- Probabilities of positive differences for Lottery A: 33% (for 675) and 66% (for 575)
- Probability of positive difference for Lottery B: 100% (for 575)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the 100% probability of winning 2400 Euros in Lottery B and the 33% chance of winning 2500 Euros in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a 100% chance of winning 2400 Euros and was not willing to risk the possibility of not winning the extra 100 Euros (2500 - 2400) in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries but did not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, while the individual chose Lottery B due to its guaranteed outcome, focusing on the risk of not gaining the extra 100 Euros rather than on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the aspiration level and differences from it are not mentioned. However, the individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B indirectly relates to the concept of minimizing risk, which could be tangentially related to avoiding negative differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lotteries A and B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 0 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are: for 2500 Euros, the difference is 1275 Euros; for 0 Euros, the difference is -1225 Euros; for 2400 Euros, the difference is 1175 Euros; and for 0 Euros, the difference is -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. For Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (2500 Euros) is 33%, and for Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference (2400 Euros) is 34%. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a higher probability (34%) of a positive difference compared to Lottery B (33%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the percentages (probabilities) are almost the same (""Prozent zahlen sind fast gleich""), indicating they considered the probabilities of the lotteries. They then decided based on the difference in the Euro amounts (""habe ich mich für 100 Euro mehr entschieden""), focusing on the 100 Euro difference between the two positive outcomes.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the Euro amounts of the two lotteries and choosing the one with the higher amount, despite the probabilities being almost the same.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the probabilities and the difference in Euro amounts but did not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this case would prefer Lottery A due to its slightly higher probability of a positive outcome. The individual chose Lottery A but based their decision on the direct comparison of the Euro amounts and the similarity in probabilities, not explicitly on the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as it is defined, focusing instead on a simpler comparison of outcomes and probabilities without explicit reference to an aspiration level or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A offers 4000 Euros and 0 Euros.
- Lottery B offers 3000 Euros.
The aspiration level is calculated as (4000 + 0 + 3000) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 (positive) and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 (negative).
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 (positive).
Given the probabilities:
- Lottery A has an 80% chance of a positive difference and a 20% chance of a negative difference.
- Lottery B has a 100% chance of a positive difference.
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and this level, along with their associated probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions ""4000 Euro zu gewinnen ist 80% also ein hoher Anzahl"" which translates to ""winning 4000 Euros is 80%, a high number,"" indicating consideration of the high outcome and its probability in Lottery A. However, the focus is on the certainty of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B, as the individual decides to ""verzichten"" (waive) the 100% win of 3000 Euros, suggesting a comparison between the certainty of Lottery B and the higher but less certain outcome of Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The justification provided is essentially about comparing the high probability of a significant win in Lottery A against the certainty of a smaller win in Lottery B, but the decision leans towards the certainty of the win, not directly mentioning the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level. Instead, it focuses on the comparison of outcomes and their probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of the certainty of outcomes and their probabilities, without explicit reference to an aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined, focusing instead on the comparison of probabilities and outcomes without reference to an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0) / 4 = 3500 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 1750 = 1250 Euros and 0 - 1750 = -1750 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 1750 = 2250 Euros and 0 - 1750 = -1750 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual's report mentions the difference in potential winnings between Lottery A and B (""Zwischen Loterie A und B sind 1000 Euro differenz zu gewinnen""). This suggests the individual considered the potential outcomes of the two lotteries. The individual also mentions a ""5% gewinn oder verlier Risiko,"" which could be interpreted as a consideration of the probabilities associated with the lotteries, although it's not entirely clear how this risk is quantified or compared between the two lotteries. The justification for the choice seems to hinge on the potential gain and a risk assessment, but the specifics of how the risk is evaluated are not detailed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (difference in potential winnings and a mention of risk), there seems to be a partial alignment. The individual does consider the outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences as per the decision reason. The individual's justification for the choice focuses on the difference in potential winnings and a risk, which does not directly correspond to the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. 

However, the individual's consideration of the difference in potential winnings could indirectly relate to the concept of aspiration levels and differences, as both involve evaluating outcomes. The lack of explicit mention of calculating probabilities of positive differences or directly comparing these probabilities between the lotteries makes it uncertain whether the decision reason was used as defined.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
This assessment reflects that while there are some elements in the verbal report that could be related to the decision reason (consideration of outcomes), the key components of the decision reason (calculation of an aspiration level, consideration of probabilities of positive differences from this level) are not explicitly mentioned or clearly applied in the individual's justification. Thus, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but the available information leans more towards it not being used as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros (twice, since it appears in both lotteries), and 3000 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 0 + 3000) / 4 = 4500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for 6000 Euros, the difference is +1500; for 0 Euros, the difference is -4500; and for 3000 Euros, the difference is -1500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the positive difference (+1500 is not an outcome but -1500 is, and since there's no outcome above 4500 in Lottery A, we consider the probability of getting a positive difference which in this case doesn't apply directly as the outcome is below the aspiration level) occurs with 90% probability (since the 3000 Euro outcome, although below the aspiration level, is the only outcome considered and it's below, not above, indicating a misunderstanding in direct application). In Lottery B, the positive difference (+1500, considering the outcome above the aspiration level) occurs with 45% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied but requires understanding the aspiration level and the concept of positive differences, which may not directly align with the initial interpretation due to the nature of the outcomes provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference between 3000 and 6000 Euros to be significant (""riesen unterschied"") and views 45% as a high percentage for winning.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to ""risk it"" (""deshalb würde ich es riskieren"") because of the significant difference and the perceived high winning percentage, implying a focus on the potential high reward of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the difference between outcomes and views the higher potential reward as significant, which aligns with considering differences from an aspiration level but does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level based on the mean of all outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, but the individual's justification is more about the size of the reward and the perceived high probability of winning, rather than explicitly comparing probabilities of outcomes above an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's focus on the difference between outcomes and the desire for a higher reward might superficially align with aspects of the decision reason, the specific rule about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level calculated as the mean of all outcomes is not explicitly mentioned or clearly applied in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner described, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention or clearly apply the concept of an aspiration level or the rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus is more on the absolute difference between potential winnings and the perceived high probability of a significant win."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 6000 Euros and 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 3000 Euros and 0 Euros
The aspiration level = (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: 6000 - 4500 = 1500 (positive) and 0 - 4500 = -4500 (negative)
- For Lottery B: 3000 - 4500 = -1500 (negative) and 0 - 4500 = -4500 (negative)
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 
In this case, Lottery A has a 0.1% chance of a positive difference, and Lottery B has no chance of a positive difference since both its outcomes are below the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the sum of the outcomes of Lottery B being less but the percentage (0.1) being higher for Lottery A, and the sum of Lottery A being double, implying they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to justify their choice by comparing the outcomes and their probabilities, specifically mentioning that the doubled sum of Lottery A makes the 0.2% win chance of Lottery B negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or focusing on the differences from such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification focuses on the comparative outcomes and probabilities but does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration levels or preferring based on probabilities of exceeding such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or consideration of differences from such a level as the basis for their decision. The focus is on the comparative values of the lotteries and their probabilities without explicit reference to the decision reason's core elements. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 + (-3000)) / 3 = -2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -4000 - (-2333.33) = -1666.67 and 0 - (-2333.33) = 2333.33; for Lottery A, -3000 - (-2333.33) = -666.67. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B has a 20% chance of a positive difference (2333.33) and Lottery A has a 0% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of potential loss (""1000 Euro mehr zu verlieren"") and the risk associated with Lottery B (""kein Risiko eingehen""). 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it involves a fixed loss of 3000 Euros, which is perceived as better than the potential loss of 4000 Euros in Lottery B, and the individual is averse to taking the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences, whereas the individual considered the potential loss and risk. There is no direct mention of calculating an aspiration level or considering the probability of positive differences in the verbal report.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, whereas the individual preferred Lottery A due to risk aversion and avoiding a higher potential loss. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's focus on risk aversion and avoiding a higher potential loss does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as the basis for their decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: -4000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: -3000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as: (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: -4000 - (-1750) = -2250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
- For Lottery B: -3000 - (-1750) = -1250, 0 - (-1750) = 1750
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the loss amount and its difference between the two lotteries, mentioning ""der Verlust auf jedenfall trotz % Anzahl 1000 Euro weniger ist,"" which translates to ""the loss is in any case 1000 Euros less despite the percentage number.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is 1000 Euros less, indicating a focus on the absolute difference in potential losses between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the absolute difference in potential losses, not explicitly mentioning or calculating an aspiration level or considering probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on the absolute difference in losses, not the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.
Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as described, focusing instead on a straightforward comparison of potential losses rather than the probabilistic consideration of differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as the mean of -6000, 0, -3000, and 0, which equals (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 55% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome) and a 45% chance of a negative difference (-6000 Euros outcome). Lottery B has a 90% chance of a negative difference (-3000 Euros outcome) and a 10% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros outcome). However, upon closer examination, it seems there was an initial misunderstanding in calculating the probability of positive differences for each lottery based on the aspiration level. The aspiration level is -2250 Euros, so for Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros is indeed a positive difference, but the outcome of -6000 Euros is a negative difference. For Lottery B, the outcome of -3000 Euros is a negative difference, and the outcome of 0 Euros is a positive difference. Thus, Lottery A offers a 55% chance of a positive difference (since 0 Euros is above the aspiration level) and a 45% chance of a negative difference. Lottery B offers a 10% chance of a positive difference and a 90% chance of a negative difference. The reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a higher probability (55%) of outcomes that are above the aspiration level compared to Lottery B (10%). 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual states, ""bei der Loterie B ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit 6000 Euro zu verlieren 90 %. Deshalb A ausgewählt,"" which translates to ""With Lottery B, the probability of losing 6000 Euros is 90%. Therefore, A was chosen."" This statement indicates the individual considered the probability of losing a significant amount in Lottery B but misinterprets the probability related to Lottery B. The actual probability of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B is 0% since the worst outcome in Lottery B is losing 3000 Euros with a 90% probability. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A seems to be based on a misunderstanding of Lottery B's outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual, it appears there is a discrepancy. The individual's reasoning does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level. Instead, the individual incorrectly states the probability of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B, which is not a valid outcome for Lottery B. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which is not reflected in the individual's justification. The individual's choice of Lottery A could align with the decision reason's outcome but not for the reasons the decision reason outlines.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since positive differences are associated with outcomes of 0 Euros in both lotteries, we need to compare the probabilities of 0 Euros in both lotteries, which are 99.9% for Lottery B and 99.8% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""6000 Euro Verlust"" (6000 Euro loss) and compares it to ""3000 Euro"" (3000 Euro), indicating they are considering the loss amounts of the two lotteries. They also mention ""% Anzahl"" (% number), which likely refers to the probabilities, stating they are ""sehr identisch"" (very similar).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be focusing on the magnitude of the potential losses and the similarity in probabilities, without explicitly mentioning the aspiration level or the preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the loss amounts and the similarity in probabilities without explicitly calculating or referencing an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery B due to its slightly higher probability (99.9% vs. 99.8%) of the 0 Euro outcome. The individual's justification does not clearly align with this rule, as they do not discuss the preference for positive differences or explicitly choose based on the probabilities of such outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from this level. The focus on loss amounts and the similarity in probabilities does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, the assessment is that it is unlikely, but not entirely impossible, that the decision reason was used, leading to a low score."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level = (500 + 1000 + 0) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 0 (since 500 - 500 = 0); for Lottery B, the differences are 500 (1000 - 500) and -500 (0 - 500). The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery B offers a 50% chance of a positive difference (500) and Lottery A offers no chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is exactly the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain of 500 Euros more with Lottery B and acknowledged the risk of losing (getting 0 Euros) as part of the gamble, similar to playing the lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B over the guaranteed 500 Euros from Lottery A because they were willing to risk losing in order to potentially gain 1000 Euros, comparing it to the mindset of playing the lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the potential for higher gain and the risk of loss, which aligns with considering differences from a certain point (though the aspiration level as defined by the decision reason is not explicitly mentioned).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offered a chance at a higher gain, which can be seen as seeking a positive difference from the guaranteed amount (500 Euros), even if not explicitly framed as an aspiration level.

Given these comparisons, the individual’s focus on the potential for greater gain and willingness to accept risk for this gain somewhat aligns with the decision reason’s emphasis on positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or considering an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason, nor does it discuss probabilities of positive differences in the exact terms of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment indicates that while there are some elements in the individual's decision-making process that align with the decision reason (such as considering the potential for higher gain and accepting risk), the explicit calculations and considerations of the aspiration level and probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason are not clearly present in the verbal report. Therefore, it is somewhat uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but leaning towards it not being the primary basis for the decision."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros. The mean of all outcomes is (-500 + (-1000) + 0) / 3 = -500 Euros. The aspiration level is -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -500 - (-500) = 0; for Lottery B, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A has a 100% loss and that Lottery B has a 50% chance of losing nothing (0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offers a 50% chance of not losing anything (0 Euros), which is seen as a preferable option compared to the certain loss of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, focusing on the probability of positive differences. The individual's consideration does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it but does focus on the chance of not losing, which can be related to the concept of positive differences from a certain threshold (in this case, losing nothing).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a chance of not losing, which aligns with seeking a positive outcome (not losing) but does not directly reference an aspiration level or the specific rule of preferring the higher probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason's specific process of calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. However, the individual's focus on avoiding a certain loss and seeking a chance of no loss indirectly touches on the concept of preferring outcomes that are better than a certain threshold, which is somewhat related to the decision reason's focus on positive differences. The lack of direct reference to an aspiration level or the specific rule about probabilities of positive differences suggests that the decision reason was not explicitly used. Therefore, the assessment is closer to certainty that the decision reason was not used but acknowledges a slight, indirect alignment in the preference for avoiding certain loss."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 25% probability in Lottery B twice, which adds up to 50% for winning either 2000 or 4000 Euros. They also considered the high outcome of 6000 Euros in Lottery A but were deterred by its low probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by focusing on the probability of winning in Lottery B, highlighting that the chance to win 2000 or 4000 Euros is higher compared to the low probability of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities of winning specific amounts without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred Lottery B because it offers a higher overall chance of winning a positive amount (either 2000 or 4000 Euros), which aligns with preferring a higher probability of positive outcomes but does not directly reference an aspiration level or the specific rule of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the probability of winning and the implicit consideration of the attractiveness of outcomes in their verbal report slightly aligns with the spirit of the decision reason, which considers the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to it, which are key components of the decision reason. Thus, while there is a superficial alignment in preferring outcomes with higher probabilities of occurrence, the detailed process described by the decision reason does not closely match the individual's justification. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but there is a minor alignment in the preference for higher probabilities of positive outcomes."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 and 0 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) can be calculated as the mean of -6000, -4000, -2000, and 0 Euros: AL = (-6000 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 4 = -5000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are considered important. For Lottery A, the differences are: -4000 - (-5000) = 1000, -2000 - (-5000) = 3000, and 0 - (-5000) = 5000. For Lottery B, the differences are: -6000 - (-5000) = -1000 and 0 - (-5000) = 5000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the percentage (probability) plays no role and compares the losses, stating that a loss of 6000 Euros is more than 2000 or 4000 Euros. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery B is larger than the losses in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's report does not mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences but focuses on comparing the magnitude of losses directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, whereas the individual chose based on the magnitude of losses without mentioning probabilities or an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's focus on the magnitude of losses and ignoring probabilities suggests a different decision-making rationale. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1683.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5000 - 1683.33 = 3316.67 and 0 - 1683.33 = -1683.33; for Lottery B, 5 - 1683.33 = -1678.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 0.1% probability of a positive difference and Lottery B has 0% probability of a positive difference (as its outcome is less than the aspiration level), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the low probability (0.1%) of winning in Lottery A and decides it's not worth the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because the low probability of winning in Lottery A makes it not worth the risk, and they prefer the guaranteed 5 Euros from Lottery B, which they can use to buy something pleasant (Schokolade).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of winning in Lottery B, without explicitly mentioning or calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B due to the low probability of winning in Lottery A, which does not directly relate to comparing probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The individual's focus is on the risk associated with the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of winning in Lottery B, rather than on calculating and comparing differences from an aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -5005 / 3 ≈ -1671.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1671.67) = -3328.33 Euros and 0 - (-1671.67) = 1671.67 Euros; for Lottery A, -5 - (-1671.67) = 1666.67 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since the aspiration level is negative, a positive difference means an outcome better than this negative aspiration level. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual considers the high potential loss of 5000 Euros in Lottery B, even with a low probability, and prefers the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery A. The individual's justification focuses on avoiding the high potential loss, indicating a consideration of the magnitude of the loss and its impact, even with a very low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities), there's a partial alignment in that both consider the outcomes, but the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing differences from it. The individual's justification for the choice (avoiding a high potential loss) does not directly match the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level). However, the concern for avoiding significant losses could indirectly relate to preferring outcomes that are more favorable than a negative aspiration level, suggesting some alignment in the concern for outcomes relative to a reference point (even if not explicitly the aspiration level calculated in Step 1).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a concern for avoiding significant losses, which aligns somewhat with the concept of preferring outcomes that are better than a negative reference point (like the aspiration level). However, the explicit calculation and comparison based on the aspiration level, as defined by the decision reason, are not mentioned. Therefore, while there's a conceptual overlap, the direct application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the verbal report."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery A, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to be focusing on the potential gain and the probability of winning, mentioning that if the gain is twice as much, they would choose the lottery with a 50% chance of winning (Lottery B) over the certain 1500 Euros (Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the potential for a higher gain, but they also consider the certainty of the 1500 Euros. The statement implies a comparison between the potential outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the potential gain and the certainty of one of the options.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences does not directly align with the individual's justification, which seems to weigh potential gain against certainty without explicitly considering probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considers aspects of the lotteries (like potential gain and certainty), the specific process of calculating an aspiration level and preferring based on the probability of positive differences, as outlined in the decision reason, is not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's focus and justification do not closely align with the decision reason's criteria, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 - 3000 + 2000) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 2000 Euros for the respective outcomes. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, there is a 50% probability of a positive difference (3000 Euros) and a 50% probability of a negative difference (-3000 Euros). In Lottery B, there is a 100% probability of a positive difference (2000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""mit der Loterie A gewinne ich 1000 Euro mehr"" which translates to ""with Lottery A, I win 1000 Euros more."" This suggests the individual is considering the potential gains from each lottery but seems to be making a comparison based on the maximum possible gain rather than the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies the choice by saying ""auch wenn es 50% ist dann würde ich es riskieren und mehr gewinnen wollen"" which translates to ""even if it's 50%, then I would take the risk and want to win more."" This indicates the individual is willing to take a risk for a higher potential gain but does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as the basis for the decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and probability of positive differences) with that considered by the individual (potential gains and risk-taking for higher rewards), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual does not explicitly consider the aspiration level or the probability of positive differences as outlined in the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences) to the individual’s justification for the choice (willingness to take a risk for higher potential gains), there is not a clear alignment. The individual's focus is on the potential for higher gains and the willingness to take risks, rather than on the probability of outcomes being above an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences. The report suggests a focus on potential gains and risk-taking rather than the specific criteria outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. The mean of all outcomes (1000, 3000, -3000) is (1000 + 3000 - 3000)/3 = 0. Thus, the aspiration level is 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 0 = 1000; for Lottery B, 3000 - 0 = 3000 and -3000 - 0 = -3000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""differenz"" (difference) of 2000 Euros, suggesting they considered the difference between potential outcomes. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides not to take the 1000 Euros (Lottery A) and instead chooses to try a 50% win chance (implied to be Lottery B), indicating they are willing to take a risk for a potentially higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level. The individual's mention of a ""difference"" suggests they considered outcome differences, but it's unclear if they calculated an aspiration level as the reason specifies.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual chooses Lottery B, which offers a higher potential gain (and thus potentially more positive difference from an aspiration level of 0), but their justification focuses on the difference and the chance to win, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on differences and their willingness to take a risk for a higher potential gain somewhat aligns with the decision reason's emphasis on differences from an aspiration level and preferring higher probabilities of positive differences. However, the verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating an aspiration level or directly comparing probabilities of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason. Thus, while there's a slight alignment, it's uncertain and not strongly indicative that the decision reason was used as specified."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for the outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that playing the lottery is a game of chance and that there is a 50% chance of winning or losing 6000 Euros in Lottery A. They also compare this to the 100% chance of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice of Lottery A by stating that it is worth trying, implying that the potential gain is more attractive than the certain outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, which is relevant to calculating the aspiration level and the differences between outcomes and the aspiration level. However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual's choice of Lottery A over Lottery B because it offers a chance to win, despite the risk. However, the individual's justification focuses more on the attractiveness of the potential gain rather than explicitly on the probability of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences, which are key components of the decision reason. While the individual's choice and justification align with the outcome of applying the decision reason, the process described does not clearly indicate the use of this specific reason. Therefore, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating a leaning towards the decision reason not being used but with some uncertainty."
