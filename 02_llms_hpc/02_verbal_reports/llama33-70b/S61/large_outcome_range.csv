STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2400 Euros, since there is only one possible outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 2500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a loss chance of 1% being practically irrelevant and a 33% chance being significant. They also mention the risk of getting nothing (0 Euros) as ""nahezu ignorierbar"" (nearly negligible) and consider it worth taking to increase their probable gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the negligible risk of losing against the potential for a higher gain, indicating they are willing to take on a small risk for a potentially larger reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. While the individual discusses the risks and potential gains, they do not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries. However, their consideration of the ""nahezu ignorierbare Risiko, leer auszugehen"" (nearly negligible risk of getting nothing) implies an awareness of the range of outcomes, particularly the minimum outcome of 0 Euros in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing a lottery (implied to be Lottery A, based on the context of risking a loss for a higher gain) aligns with preferring a higher potential gain over a guaranteed, but lower, amount. However, the individual's reasoning is more focused on the perceived value of risk-taking for potential higher rewards rather than explicitly on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's verbal report suggests an awareness of the risks and potential rewards associated with each lottery and a willingness to take on small risks for potentially larger gains. While their justification aligns with the general principle of preferring higher potential outcomes, it does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific focus on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there are hints that the individual considered aspects related to the reason, leading to a score slightly above the midpoint of uncertainty."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 2400 - 0 = 2400 Euros, and for Lottery B, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process. The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but found it not entirely unrealistic. They focused on the similarity in the numerical values of the outcomes and weighed the decision based on whether the potential loss of 100 Euros in the prize money was worth increasing the chance of winning by one percentage point. The individual justified their choice by prioritizing the mitigation of the high risk of winning nothing over having 100 Euros more in the winning case.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the similarity in numerical values, the trade-off between the potential loss of 100 Euros for a 1% increase in winning chance), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as the primary factor. Instead, they focused on the trade-off between the potential loss and the increase in winning probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification. The individual's justification revolves around risk mitigation and the value of increasing the winning chance, not directly on the difference between the outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

This assessment indicates that it is certain the decision reason was not used by the individual, as their deliberation process and justification for the choice did not align with the rule specified by the decision reason. The individual's focus was on the trade-off between the increase in winning probability and the decrease in potential winnings, rather than on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, but the probabilities are not necessary for this specific reason. The key information is the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, which had a 20% probability, and compared it with the certainty of gaining 3000 Euros with Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by preferring the certain gain over the risk of loss, even though the risk was relatively low.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process. The individual focused more on the risk of loss and the certainty of gain rather than the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding risk rather than comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's focus was on risk aversion and the certainty of the outcome rather than the specific differences between the outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison to another lottery decision (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and considers the significance of increasing their chances of success in an unlikely but realistic lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prioritizes significantly increasing their chances of success over maximizing their potential gain, implying a focus on probability rather than the absolute value of the outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of increasing their chances of success.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes increasing the chances of success, not directly addressing the difference between outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on increasing their chances of success and the provided justification do not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome. The individual's reasoning seems to prioritize probability over the potential gain difference between the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B and the relatively high value of the potential win (3000 Euros), comparing it to the lower probability (45%) of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the ""sichere Route"" (safe route) offered by Lottery B due to its high probability of winning, indicating a preference for certainty over the riskier option of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations were more aligned with the probabilities and the attractiveness of the potential wins rather than the difference between the outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (6000 Euros difference vs. 3000 Euros for Lottery B). However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the high probability of winning and the attractiveness of the ""safe"" option, not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The focus on probability and the preference for a ""safe"" option over the potential for a higher reward does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries as practically negligible. The individual then focuses on the idea that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also overcome a 0.1% chance, implying a consideration of the likelihoods but concludes by stating the decision was based on the height of the prize money in the case of a lucky win. The information considered by the individual includes the probabilities and the prize amounts. The individual's justification for the choice is based on the prize money when considering a lucky win.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and prize amounts), there is a match in the sense that the individual does consider the prize amounts, which are part of the decision reason's criteria (maximum outcome). However, the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification focuses on the prize money in case of winning, which indirectly aligns with preferring the lottery with the higher maximum outcome (Lottery A, with 6000 Euros), but does not directly address the comparison of outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's decision is influenced by the prize money (which is part of the decision reason's consideration), the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries as the basis for the decision. The indirect alignment with the decision reason (preferring the higher prize, which corresponds to the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum outcomes) suggests some influence but lacks a direct, clear application of the decision reason as stated."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome, the difference is 0 Euros (as both the maximum and minimum are -3000 Euros). This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the probabilities of outcomes, the amount of potential losses, and the concept of minimizing the ""realistisch wahrscheinlichen Verlust"" (realistically probable loss). 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice focuses on minimizing the probable loss, considering the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery A as too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000 Euros compared to the certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities, amounts of potential losses, and minimizing probable loss), it appears the individual did not directly consider the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery as the primary factor.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (minimizing the probable loss), the individual's decision-making process does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual prioritized minimizing loss over considering the range of outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the larger difference. For Lottery A, the difference is 0 - (-4000) = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 0 - (-3000) = 3000 Euros. Since both lotteries have a minimum outcome of -4000 and -3000 Euros respectively and a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The relevant information is that Lottery A has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcome compared to Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of the losses and the magnitude of potential losses, indicating that higher loss amounts are valued more negatively than gain amounts.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on not wanting to risk a larger loss, despite the probabilities, indicating a focus on loss aversion and the magnitude of potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. The individual, however, focused on the magnitude of potential losses and the risk of incurring those losses, rather than explicitly comparing the differences between the outcomes of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on avoiding a larger potential loss, which aligns with choosing Lottery B over Lottery A because it has a smaller maximum loss, not because of the difference between the outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The individual's focus was more on loss aversion and the absolute magnitude of potential losses rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is -6000 - 0 = -6000 Euros, but since we're looking at the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for the purpose of this reason, we consider the absolute value, which is 6000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison between these differences: 6000 Euros for Lottery B and 3000 Euros for Lottery A. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options and the attractive reduction in loss probability from 90% to 45%. They weighed the risk of a much higher loss against the benefit of reducing the probability of any loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), avoiding the potential for a 6000 Euro loss, indicating a preference for minimizing the risk of a high loss over the potential benefit of reducing the loss probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on loss probabilities and the attractiveness of reducing the risk of high losses. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding the higher potential loss and taking the ""safe route,"" which aligns more with choosing Lottery A due to its lower maximum loss, not because of the difference between its outcomes. 

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not directly align with the decision reason provided, which prioritizes the lottery with the larger outcome difference. The individual's focus was more on risk aversion and the attractiveness of reducing the probability of a significant loss rather than on the difference between the outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since -6000 Euros is the minimum outcome) and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities of the two lotteries (0.1% and 0.2%) and considers them ""ungefähr gleich irrelevant"" (approximately equally irrelevant) for a single trial. The focus then shifts to minimizing the ""Strafbetrag"" (penalty amount) in a theoretical worst-case scenario.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aims to minimize the penalty amount in case of an unfavorable outcome, implying a focus on the worst possible outcome of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual focuses on minimizing the penalty amount, which relates to the worst-case scenario (minimum outcome) but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes. In contrast, the individual's justification emphasizes minimizing the penalty (or loss) in the worst-case scenario, which indirectly relates to the decision reason but does not directly compare the outcome differences between the two lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that while the individual's focus on minimizing the penalty amount aligns with considering the worst-case scenario (minimum outcome), it does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there is some alignment in considering the worst-case outcomes, the individual's decision process as described does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on minimizing the penalty amount suggests a consideration of the worst-case scenario but does not explicitly involve comparing the outcome ranges of the two lotteries as the decision reason dictates."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 1000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 500 Euros (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that mathematically, both options were equal in value, but they also considered the aspect of ensuring their winnings would increase rather than maximizing the potential for further winnings.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to focus on the certainty of increasing their winnings, implying they prioritized the guaranteed outcome over the potential for a higher but uncertain gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the decision-making process. The individual's consideration is more about the certainty of gain versus the potential for more.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize certainty (Lottery B) over potential maximum gain, which does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as a basis for their decision, nor does their justification for choosing Lottery B align with the rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -500 Euros and the minimum outcome is also -500 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the 50% chance of an outcome as relevant, indicating they are taking into account the probabilities of the lotteries. However, the focus is on minimizing the ""absoluten möglichen Verlustwert,"" which translates to minimizing the absolute possible loss value. This suggests the individual is considering the worst-case scenario or the minimum outcome of each lottery.

Second, the justification for the choice is based on minimizing the absolute possible loss, which implies the individual is comparing the worst-case scenarios of both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and minimizing absolute loss), it appears the individual is focusing more on the worst-case scenario rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (minimizing the absolute possible loss), it seems the individual's approach does not directly align with the decision reason. The decision reason would suggest preferring Lottery A due to its larger difference between outcomes, but the individual's focus is on minimizing loss, which would suggest preferring Lottery B due to its smaller absolute loss.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The individual's focus was on minimizing loss rather than on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of money (excluding zero) to be large since they were all four-digit numbers. They focused on which option gave them a higher probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual based their decision on the option that provided a greater probability of winning a large amount, not directly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which are 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 4000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the probability of winning a large amount, not directly on these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's justification, however, was based on the probability of winning a large amount, not the difference between the outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly use the decision reason that involves comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries to make their decision. Instead, their focus was on the probability of winning a significant amount.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 5000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcomes are both 5 Euros, since it's a guaranteed outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in outcomes for each lottery: 5000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 0.1% probability of winning in Lottery A and considers it ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), implying they focus on the practicality or guarantee of the outcome rather than the potential high reward with a very low probability. They also mention preferring a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring a guaranteed small gain (Lottery B) over the very low probability of a significant gain (Lottery A), emphasizing the value of a certain outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. However, the individual's consideration is more about the practicality and guarantee of the outcome, not explicitly about the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes (5000 Euros vs. 0 Euros for Lottery B). In contrast, the individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed small win, which does not align with the decision reason's rule that prioritizes the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which would lead to a preference for Lottery A, but the individual prefers Lottery B based on the guarantee of a small win, indicating they did not use the given decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is a constant -5 Euros, meaning the maximum and minimum outcome are the same, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its minimum and maximum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss amount in Lottery A, found it unattractive, but then looked at the probability distribution. They noted the 0.1% probability of losing 5000 Euros is negligible, making a loss of 0 Euros practically guaranteed.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, after considering the negligible risk of the significant loss, they felt the effective outcome was a guaranteed 0 Euros, which they preferred over the certain loss of 5 Euros in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual, however, focused on the attractiveness of the losses and the negligible probability of the significant loss in Lottery A, not explicitly on the difference between the outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual chose Lottery A but based on the negligible risk of the significant loss, not explicitly because of the difference in outcome ranges.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was on the perceived risk and practical guarantee of the outcome rather than the range of possible outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability and potential outcomes of both lotteries, calculating the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A as 0 Euros due to its equal chances of gaining or losing 3000 Euros, and noted the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B as 1500 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by comparing the expected outcomes, noting that Lottery B offers a guaranteed positive outcome, whereas Lottery A's expected outcome over numerous attempts would be 0 Euros, implying a preference for the certainty of a positive gain over the risk of no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. However, the individual's consideration was more focused on the expected values and the certainty of the outcomes rather than the range between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. In contrast, the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for the guaranteed positive outcome of Lottery B over the uncertain outcome of Lottery A, which does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided, which focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of a positive outcome and the comparison of expected values, not the range of possible outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 2000 Euros (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a previous similar decision involving a lottery with outcomes of 3000/-3000 Euros (50/50 probability) compared to a guaranteed option (previously 1500 Euros, now 2000 Euros), indicating they considered the structure of the lotteries and the attractiveness of the guaranteed option.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that the decision was ""selfverständlich"" (obvious or straightforward), implying that the choice was clear to them, likely due to the increased attractiveness of the guaranteed option (2000 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the structure of the lotteries and the attractiveness of the guaranteed option but did not explicitly mention calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification focuses on the attractiveness of the guaranteed option (Lottery A), not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. Instead, their focus was on the attractiveness of the guaranteed option, suggesting a different decision-making process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, since it's a guaranteed outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed gain of 1000 Euros from Lottery B and compares it to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A, implying they are looking at the outcomes and possibly their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by noting that while the guaranteed gain from Lottery B is significantly less than the maximum outcome of Lottery A, it is still more than the expected value of Lottery A, indicating a preference for a sure gain over a gamble.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor for the decision. Instead, the individual discusses the guaranteed gain versus the expected value.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not align with this rule; they prefer the guaranteed gain of Lottery B over the potential higher but risky gain of Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus was on the guaranteed gain versus the expected value, suggesting that the decision reason provided was not used by the individual to make their decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same (0 Euros), so the difference is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, making the difference 12000 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B and recognized that Lottery A is not a gamble since it offers 0 Euros with 100% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified excluding Lottery B (Option 2) because one of its outcomes was a theoretical loss of 6000 Euros, and at that point, the probabilities were deemed irrelevant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. However, the individual's consideration was primarily about the risk of losing a significant amount of money and the fact that one option (Lottery A) carried no risk.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. In contrast, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding the risk of a significant loss, not on comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual focused on avoiding risk rather than comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
