STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there is only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, resulting in a difference of 65%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which in this case would be Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of a high gain in Lottery A, the low probability of no gain in Lottery B, and the fact that the high probability outcome in Lottery B is the same as the outcome in Lottery A. They also considered the potential to gain up to 100 Euros more with Lottery B but weighed it against the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that despite the low risk of not gaining anything with Lottery B, the potential maximum gain of 100 Euros more than Lottery A did not make the risk worthwhile.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses probabilities and risks but does not frame their decision in terms of the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery B due to its larger difference between minimum and maximum probabilities. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the risk not being worth the potential extra gain, not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The verbal report focuses on the risk, certainty of gain, and the value of potential extra gain, without mentioning the specific probabilities' differences as the basis for the decision. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 33% (or 100% - 67%), and for Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0%) and the maximum probability is 34% (or 100% - 66%). The differences are 33% for Lottery A and 34% for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem, and the relevant information is the probability differences between the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual includes the fact that in both lotteries, it is most likely to make neither a win nor a loss, and the possibilities of winning differ by 1% between the two lotteries. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice is that the lotteries are approximately equally good, and the decision was made spontaneously. The individual seems to focus on the similarity between the lotteries and the slight difference in winning probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the similarity between the lotteries and the slight difference in winning probabilities), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the probability differences as defined by the decision reason. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (the lotteries are approximately equally good), it seems that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus is on the similarity and the slight difference in winning probabilities, not on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery or used this criterion to make their decision. The focus was on the similarity between the lotteries and the slight difference in winning probabilities, which does not align with the decision reason provided. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B has a probability difference of 60%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of a high gain with Lottery A and the possibility of no gain (or neither gain nor loss, as they mention) with Lottery B, noting this possibility is not highly unlikely. They also considered the difference in potential gain between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential higher gain of Lottery B did not outweigh the risk of not gaining anything, especially since the difference in potential gain was only 1000 Euros more than Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration was more about the certainty of gain versus the risk of no gain and the difference in potential gains.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the risk associated with Lottery B and the comparative gain, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the certainty of gain and the risk of not gaining, rather than on the probability differences. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 75% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 25% (for 3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 25%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (implicitly, as 80% is the probability of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 20% (for 4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the fact that both lotteries have a high probability of yielding no gain or loss, and that Lottery A offers a potentially higher gain. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice seems to be based on a general impression that both lotteries are roughly equal but mentions the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A. The decision is described as spontaneous.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (high probability of no gain or loss and potential for higher gain in Lottery A), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the probability differences as described by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (rough equality but noting a higher potential gain in Lottery A), there is no clear indication that the decision reason’s specific rule was applied. The individual's justification does not mention the probability differences as a factor.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 10% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 90% (3000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 80%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 55% (0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 45% (6000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning a good amount in Lottery A and the higher possible win in Lottery B, which, however, comes with a significantly lower probability. The individual also noted that with Lottery B, there's over a 50% chance of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual found Lottery A more attractive due to its higher probability of winning, despite the lower potential gain compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual, however, discusses the absolute probabilities and the attractiveness based on the balance between potential gain and its probability, not explicitly mentioning the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A with an 80% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived attractiveness of the higher probability of winning in Lottery A, not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual does choose Lottery A, which aligns with what the decision reason would prefer based on the calculated differences (80% for A vs. 10% for B), the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not explicitly mention or imply consideration of these probability differences as the basis for the choice. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002) and the minimum probability is 99.8% (or 0.998), so the difference is 0.998 - 0.002 = 0.996. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the minimum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), so the difference is 0.999 - 0.001 = 0.998. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of not winning in both lotteries, the potential gain of Lottery A being twice as high as Lottery B (though this is not accurate based on the provided data, as Lottery B offers 6000 Euros and Lottery A offers 3000 Euros), and the lower probability of winning in Lottery A compared to Lottery B (which is also not accurate based on the provided probabilities, as Lottery A has a 0.2% chance of winning and Lottery B has a 0.1% chance).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by considering that a win was highly unlikely in both cases, and thus, the higher potential gain could be chosen despite its slightly lower probability, implying a focus on the potential outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly compare the probability ranges of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (with a difference of 0.996) over Lottery B (with a difference of 0.998), actually preferring Lottery B based on the correct calculation. However, the individual's justification does not directly align with this rule, as it focuses on the potential gains and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is the core of the decision reason. The focus in the report is on the potential outcomes and their probabilities, not on comparing the ranges of probabilities between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% (for 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 80% (for -4000 Euros), resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences: 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries likely result in losses, with Lottery B having a smaller loss amount than Lottery A. Additionally, the individual noted that Lottery A has a 20% chance of neither winning nor losing, and recognized that the probable loss in Lottery A is higher but took this risk for a chance to have no loss or gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B by considering the potential to avoid any loss or gain, despite acknowledging the higher probable loss associated with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probability ranges within each lottery, whereas the individual considered the magnitude of losses, the certainty of loss in one lottery, and the chance of no loss or gain in the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prefer Lottery A due to its larger difference between minimum and maximum probability (60% vs. 0%), but the individual's justification does not mention or imply consideration of the probability differences between the outcomes of the lotteries as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the probability differences within each lottery, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over Lottery B.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The decision reason would prefer Lottery B because it has a larger difference (60%) between its minimum and maximum probabilities compared to Lottery A (50%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probability of a high loss in both lotteries, noting that the loss risk is somewhat lower in Lottery B than in Lottery A, despite the potential loss being higher in Lottery B. The individual weighs the difference in potential loss against the difference in probability of loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by comparing the probability of loss and the amount of potential loss, suggesting that the lower probability of loss in Lottery B compensates for the higher potential loss compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual discusses the probabilities and potential losses but does not explicitly compare the ranges of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to preferring Lottery B, but based on a different rationale (comparing the balance between the probability of loss and the amount of potential loss), not explicitly on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. While the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would prefer (Lottery B), the justification provided in the verbal report does not match the decision reason's rule.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 45% (for the -6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (for the 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 10% (for the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (for the -3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 80%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a loss in both lotteries and compared the likelihood of a loss in each. They noted that a loss could occur in both lotteries but with different probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid a loss as much as possible, considering that the higher loss amount in Lottery A occurs with a significantly lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the probability of a loss and its avoidance.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (with a difference of 80% vs. 10% for Lottery A). However, the individual chose Lottery A based on the desire to avoid a loss, not explicitly considering the difference in probability ranges between the two lotteries.

For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.2% (for -3000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 99.8% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 99.6%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries, the comparison of the loss probabilities between the two lotteries (noting that Lottery B's loss probability is double that of Lottery A but still very low), and the expected loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, despite its loss probability being double, it was still very low, and the expected loss would be significantly less than in Lottery A, making Lottery B seem more advantageous.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). For Lottery B, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100% (since there's a 100% chance of -500 Euros). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 50% - 0% = 50%, and for Lottery B, it's 100% - 100% = 0%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of loss in Lottery B (-500 Euros with 100% probability) and the 50% chance of not losing anything in Lottery A, alongside the risk of a larger loss (-1000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because it offered at least a 50% chance of not making a loss, even though it also carried the risk of a larger loss compared to Lottery B. The certainty of losing 500 Euros in Lottery B was seen as less appealing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. However, the individual's considerations, as described, focus more on the presence of a chance to avoid loss in Lottery A and the certainty of loss in Lottery B, rather than explicitly discussing the differences in probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (50% difference). The individual chose Lottery A but based on the presence of a 50% chance to not lose, not explicitly on the probability differences.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, but since the reason considers the minimum and maximum probabilities, the difference here is also between 50% (the maximum probability of getting 0 Euros or any other outcome) and 25% (the minimum probability of getting 4000 Euros or 2000 Euros), which results in a difference of 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows:
- Lottery A: Difference = 50% (75% - 25%)
- Lottery B: Difference = 25% (50% - 25%)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual notes the probability of winning in Lottery B is at least 50% (considering the 25% chance of getting 2000 Euros and the 25% chance of getting 4000 Euros), implying a focus on the presence of a guaranteed minimum probability of winning. They also compare the likelihood of winning in both lotteries, stating that a win is less probable in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prefers Lottery B because it offers a more reliable chance of winning, even though the potential win in Lottery A could be higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual. The individual focuses on the guaranteed minimum probability of winning and compares the overall likelihood of winning between the two lotteries, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of differences between maximum and minimum probabilities.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring Lottery B for its more reliable chance of winning). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule since they do not mention calculating or comparing the differences in probability ranges between the lotteries.

They noted that the probability of not making losses was lower in Lottery B but also recognized that the potential losses in Lottery A were somewhat to significantly lower.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because they wanted to avoid losses as much as possible, despite acknowledging the potential losses in Lottery A were lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus was on avoiding losses and the comparative levels of potential losses, not on the probability differences per se.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 50% difference. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on avoiding losses, not on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability to make their decision. Their choice was influenced by the desire to minimize losses rather than the specific probability differences between the lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros with 99.9% probability implies a 0% chance of the higher outcome) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (for the 5000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0.1%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 0% (as there is no range). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in Lottery A (0.1%) and the guaranteed win in Lottery B (5 Euros with 100% probability). They seem to focus on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B versus the high uncertainty and low chance of a significant win in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that hoping for the 0.1% chance of a higher win in Lottery A was unrealistic compared to the guaranteed, albeit smaller, win in Lottery B. This suggests they prioritized certainty over potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the difference in probability ranges within each lottery. However, the individual's deliberation, as described, focuses more on the comparison between the certainty of Lottery B's outcome and the uncertainty of Lottery A's outcome, rather than explicitly calculating or considering the differences in probability ranges within each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention or imply a consideration of these probability differences as the basis for their choice. Instead, they emphasize the realism of expecting a guaranteed win over hoping for a low-probability high win.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The individual seems to prioritize the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, which does not directly relate to calculating and comparing the differences in probability ranges within each lottery as the decision reason suggests.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual notes the certain loss in Lottery A, the possibility of no loss or gain in Lottery B, and the high but rare potential loss in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B by mentioning the rarity of the significant loss and the absence of a loss or gain, implying a focus on the low probability of the significant loss rather than the difference in probability ranges between the lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual discusses the probabilities and outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention this rule; instead, it focuses on the rarity of the loss and the possibility of no loss or gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities. The justification provided focuses more on the outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities. Therefore, while the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described does not clearly reflect the application of this specific decision rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or effectively 50% for the loss, but in terms of the specific outcome probabilities given, it's about the probability of winning or losing, which are both 50%), and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well, since both outcomes have the same probability. However, interpreting the rule as considering the range of probabilities for winning or losing, Lottery B has a range from 0 to 100% in terms of the outcomes (winning 3000 Euros or losing 3000 Euros), but given the probabilities are equal, the effective difference in probability (considering the decision reason's likely intent) is actually about the certainty vs. the gamble, not directly applicable as the reason suggests. The information relevant to the decision reason seems to be misaligned with how the reason is stated, as the reason appears to misunderstand how probabilities are presented in this scenario. However, the key information is the certainty of Lottery A and the gamble of Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A includes a certain gain, while Lottery B carries a risk of losing twice the amount that could be won in A, with this risk being too high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the risk associated with Lottery B being too high compared to the certain gain of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's considerations of risk and certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which does not match the individual's reasoning about risk aversion and preference for a certain gain over a gamble.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual's focus on risk and certainty does not reflect a consideration of the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is what the decision reason is based on. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% (for the -3000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 50% (for the 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (since there is only one outcome) and the maximum probability is 100% (for the 2000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 100%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected gain of Lottery B, the higher gain chance of Lottery A, and the risk of a high loss in Lottery A. They also considered the difference in gains between Lotteries A and B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the certain gain of Lottery B against the risky gain/loss of Lottery A, considering the gain difference between the two lotteries not large enough to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered probabilities (e.g., ""50%igen Wahrscheinlichkeit"") but not the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the risk and expected gain, not the difference in probability ranges. The verbal report does not indicate that the individual preferred Lottery B because of its larger difference between minimum and maximum probability.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are summarized as follows: both lotteries have a difference of 0% between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the following information: Lottery A has a 100% chance of winning, while Lottery B has a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing a high sum. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the risk of losing a high sum in Lottery B, which they perceived as too high, despite the potential for a higher gain compared to Lottery A. The individual's deliberation process centered on the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did not explicitly consider these probability differences. Instead, they focused on the risk and certainty of outcomes. Comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (focusing on the risk of loss and certainty of gain), it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as it is defined. The decision reason would not distinguish between the two lotteries based on their probability differences since both have a difference of 0%, but the individual chose based on a different criterion (risk aversion).

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well, since there is only one outcome. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it is summarized as follows: Lottery A has a probability difference of 0%, and Lottery B also has a probability difference of 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros with Lottery A and the certainty of no gain or loss with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by weighing the potential loss of 6000 Euros in Lottery A against the potential gain, concluding that the loss outweighed the gain, and thus preferred the certainty of no loss or gain offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the risk of loss and the certainty of no gain or loss). The individual did not consider the probability differences between the lotteries, which are the core of the decision reason.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the risk of loss and the certainty of outcomes). The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual's decision was based on the potential outcomes rather than the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual did not use the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery to make their decision. The verbal report indicates that the decision was based on the potential outcomes and their associated risks, not on the probability differences as specified by the decision reason."
