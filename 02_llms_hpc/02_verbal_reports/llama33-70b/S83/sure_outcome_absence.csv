STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A offers a sure outcome of 2400 Euros, while Lottery B does not offer a sure outcome but has a high probability (66%) of a similar amount (2400 Euros) and a smaller probability of a higher amount (2500 Euros) or a very low probability of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence of a sure outcome in Lottery A and the absence of a sure outcome in Lottery B, along with the specific outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the guaranteed high amount in Lottery A and the potential for a slightly higher amount in Lottery B, along with the risk of receiving nothing. They acknowledge the difference in the potential winnings is minimal but emphasize the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A, mentioning that with Lottery A, one wins a very high amount for sure, and while Lottery B offers a small chance of a slightly higher amount, it also comes with a risk of receiving nothing. The focus is on the security of the outcome rather than the absence or presence of a sure outcome as a deciding factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which is mentioned in the verbal report but not as the primary decision criterion. The individual is more concerned with the certainty and the minimal difference in potential winnings.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification emphasizes the security and certainty of the outcome in Lottery A, not explicitly preferring the lottery without a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the certainty and security of the outcome, rather than explicitly preferring the lottery without a sure outcome, suggests that the decision reason was not used to make the decision. The verbal report indicates a preference for the sure outcome due to its certainty, which is opposite to the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a sure outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome; both lotteries have probabilities of winning and losing. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries lack a sure outcome. Since both lotteries are without a sure outcome, the decision reason's preference cannot be directly applied based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries are almost the same in terms of the amounts that can be won and the chances of winning. They specifically mention that Lottery B offers a slightly higher potential win at almost the same chance.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to focus on the similarity between the two lotteries but leans towards Lottery B because it offers a slightly higher potential win at nearly the same probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual's consideration is based on the comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities, not the presence of a sure outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries lack a sure outcome, this rule does not directly apply. The individual's justification, however, is about comparing potential winnings and probabilities, not about the presence or absence of sure outcomes.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not consider the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) in their deliberation process. Instead, they focused on the potential winnings and their probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
3,"STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. The relevant information that can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities is as follows: Lottery A has a sure outcome of 3000 Euros, while Lottery B has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with 20% probability and an uncertain outcome of 4000 Euros with 80% probability. In other words, Lottery A has a sure outcome, and Lottery B does not have a sure positive outcome but has a sure outcome of 0 Euros with a certain probability.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual's deliberation process as follows: The individual notes that with Lottery A, one wins for sure (3000 Euros), whereas with Lottery B, there is a high chance of winning (4000 Euros) but also a chance of receiving nothing. The individual considers the difference in winnings between the two lotteries not to be very large and decides to ""lieber sicher gehen"" (prefer to be safe). The information considered by the individual includes the sure outcome of Lottery A, the high probability and higher amount of Lottery B, and the risk of receiving nothing with Lottery B. The individual's justification for the choice seems to prioritize the certainty of the outcome over the potential for a higher reward.

Step 3: To assess whether the decision reason was used, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome in each lottery) with that considered by the individual (sure outcome of Lottery A, high chance and higher amount of Lottery B, risk of nothing with B). The individual does consider the sure outcome, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, whereas the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for the sure outcome (Lottery A) over the uncertain one (Lottery B), indicating a contradiction with the decision reason's rule. The individual's decision to prefer Lottery A because it is ""sicher"" (safe) directly opposes the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, both lotteries (A and B) have outcomes with probabilities but no sure outcomes (100% probability of a specific outcome), as both have a chance of winning and a chance of getting 0 Euros. However, the reason's applicability in this context seems to be about comparing the absence of a guaranteed win or loss. Since neither lottery offers a sure win or loss, we derive that both lotteries are without a sure outcome in terms of winning, but they both have a sure outcome of possibly getting 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that neither lottery guarantees a win, but both have a guaranteed possibility of not winning (0 Euros outcome).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that with neither lottery can one lose money, implying they recognize the minimum outcome is 0 Euros for both. They also mention the probability of winning is approximately equally high, though they acknowledge Lottery A's chance is slightly smaller, but the potential win is higher.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus is on the absence of potential loss, the comparative probabilities of winning, and the difference in potential winnings. They do not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome but discuss the trade-offs between probability and amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the absence of a sure outcome, but the individual discusses the absence of loss, comparative probabilities, and potential winnings, not explicitly addressing the concept of a sure outcome as defined by the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have outcomes with probabilities and neither guarantees a win, the individual's justification does not directly align with this rule. The individual's decision seems more influenced by the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount that can be won, rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason as defined. The decision reason's focus on the absence of a sure outcome does not directly align with the individual's justification, which focuses more on the comparative aspects of potential winnings and probabilities.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B has a sure outcome, as both have probabilities of winning and losing. However, the reason can still be applied by noting that neither lottery has a guaranteed win or loss, but it specifically looks for the absence of a sure outcome. Since both lotteries have outcomes of 0 Euros (which could be misconstrued as a'sure outcome' of not winning), the relevant information for the decision reason is that neither lottery guarantees a win, but both have a chance of winning and not winning. Thus, the decision reason's preference would be based on the absence of a guaranteed win in both, but since both lotteries offer a chance of winning, the reason's applicability is nuanced.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery results in a loss (in the sense of losing money), the potential win in Lottery A is twice as high as in Lottery B, but the win in A is much less probable than in B. The individual also considers the win in B to be very good and very probable. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the potential gain against the probability of winning, considering both the magnitude of the potential win and its likelihood.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual discusses the probabilities and magnitudes of potential wins without directly addressing the concept of a sure outcome. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since neither lottery has a sure win, this reason does not directly apply as intended. The individual's justification, however, is based on the comparison of potential wins and their probabilities, not directly on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. 
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly use the decision reason as it is defined, since the focus was more on the probability and magnitude of the win rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. Both Lottery A and Lottery B have outcomes of 0 Euros, which can be considered as sure outcomes given their high probabilities (99.9% and 99.8%, respectively). However, the reason specifically looks for the absence of a sure outcome, which in this context seems to be a misunderstanding since both lotteries have a near-certain outcome of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. In this case, both lotteries have a sure outcome (0 Euros), but the decision reason's criteria seem to be misaligned with the typical interpretation of sure outcomes in lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probability of winning is very small in both lotteries and that if one wins, the prize is twice as much in Lottery A as in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification focuses on the comparison of the winning amounts and the low probabilities of winning, without mentioning the concept of sure outcomes or the absence thereof.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is concerned with the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's deliberation process as described in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities, not the concept of sure outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (comparing winning amounts and noting the low probabilities of winning).

Given these comparisons, the decision reason's focus on the absence of a sure outcome does not match the individual's considerations or justifications as described in the verbal report. The individual's reasoning is centered around the potential winnings and their probabilities, not the presence or absence of sure outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. For Lottery A, there is a sure outcome of -3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, there is no sure outcome because it offers -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability, meaning there is a chance, albeit small, of not losing anything. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. In this case, Lottery A has a sure outcome, and Lottery B does not.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss in Lottery A as very high and noted that while the potential loss in Lottery B is even higher, there is a small chance of not losing anything. This indicates the individual considered the certainty of loss in A and the uncertainty of loss in B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by comparing the difference in potential losses between the two lotteries and weighing it against the chance of not losing anything in Lottery B, suggesting that the potential benefit of avoiding a loss altogether makes the risk worthwhile.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the certain loss in Lottery A versus the chance of no loss in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which is Lottery B in this case. The individual’s justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the existence of a chance to avoid loss, which aligns with the principle of preferring a lottery without a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's consideration of the sure outcome in Lottery A and the lack thereof in Lottery B, along with the justification for choosing Lottery B based on the chance of not losing, directly aligns with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome. This indicates a clear application of the decision reason in the individual's deliberation process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, both A and B have a sure outcome of 0 Euros with certain probabilities (80% for A and 75% for B), but they also both have potential losses (-4000 Euros for A and -3000 Euros for B). However, the decision reason as stated seems to misunderstand the structure of the lotteries since both have a ""sure"" outcome of 0 Euros with varying probabilities, and what varies is the magnitude and probability of the loss. The relevant information for the decision reason would ideally be the presence or absence of a sure gain or loss, but since both lotteries have a potential loss and a sure outcome of 0, the reason's applicability seems misaligned with the problem's structure. Nonetheless, we proceed under the interpretation that the reason might be considering the absence of a positive sure outcome or focusing on the risk aspect.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that with both lotteries, no gain is possible, and they compare the loss amounts and their probabilities. Specifically, they mention the higher loss in Lottery A and the slightly higher probability of loss in Lottery B, but conclude that the difference in loss amount is not compensated by the difference in probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be weighing the potential losses against their probabilities, focusing on the fact that while Lottery B has a higher probability of a loss, the loss amount is not as high as in Lottery A. The justification revolves around the comparison of expected disutilities or the impact of potential losses rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is about preferring the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros, this reason seems not directly applicable as intended. The individual, however, focuses on the comparison of potential losses and their probabilities, not directly on the presence or absence of sure outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) does not align with the individual's justification (comparing potential losses and their probabilities). The individual's process is more aligned with a risk assessment or expected utility calculation rather than the decision reason provided.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not seem to align with the decision reason as stated. The decision reason focuses on the absence of a sure outcome, which is not how the individual approaches the decision, given that both lotteries have a sure outcome of 0 Euros and the individual discusses the losses and their probabilities.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure outcome of a positive gain, but both have outcomes of 0 Euros, which can be considered as a form of ""sure outcome"" in terms of not gaining anything. However, the reason seems to be focused on the presence of a non-zero, certain gain. Since neither lottery provides a certain non-zero gain, we need to interpret the reason in the context of the highest probability of a non-zero loss or gain. Lottery A has a 90% probability of a loss (-3000 Euros), and Lottery B has a 45% probability of a significant loss (-6000 Euros) but also a 55% chance of no loss (0 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities and amounts of potential losses and the fact that neither lottery guarantees a positive outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the high potential loss in both lotteries but notes the high probability of losing in Lottery A and the potential to end up with 0 Euros in Lottery B ""with a bit of luck.""
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the high probability of a significant loss in Lottery A against the potential for no loss in Lottery B, indicating a focus on avoiding certain loss and valuing the chance of escaping without loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities and amounts of potential losses and the chance of no loss, which aligns with the information relevant to the decision reason when considering the absence of a sure positive outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which could be interpreted as preferring the lottery with a chance of avoiding loss entirely (Lottery B, with its 55% chance of 0 Euros). The individual's justification seems to favor Lottery B because it offers a chance to end up with 0 Euros, which can be seen as aligning with the decision reason's preference for avoiding a certain negative outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 70
This assessment indicates a tendency towards believing the decision reason was used, given the individual's focus on avoiding certain loss and valuing the chance of no loss, which aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery without a guaranteed negative outcome. However, it's not a perfect match since the decision reason's primary focus is on the absence of a sure outcome, and the individual's reasoning is more nuanced, considering both the probability and amount of potential losses."

The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, both have a sure outcome of 0 Euros, but with different probabilities. Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros, and Lottery B has a 99.8% chance of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the presence and probability of the sure outcome (0 Euros) in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing (which is very low in both lotteries) and the amount lost in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by noting that the probability of losing is approximately equally low in both lotteries, but the amount lost is less in Lottery B. The individual also mentioned that the difference in probabilities does not make much of a difference.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual's focus was on the probability of losing and the amount lost, not directly on the presence of a sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a sure outcome, this reason does not directly apply as intended.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason's focus on the presence of a sure outcome and preferring the lottery without one does not match the individual's considerations of loss amounts and probabilities.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this decision problem, Lottery A has a 50% chance of winning 1000 Euros and a 50% chance of winning 0 Euros, meaning it does not have a sure outcome. Lottery B offers a sure outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: Lottery A has no sure outcome, and Lottery B has a sure outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a secure win, and Lottery A has a higher potential win but also the possibility of receiving nothing. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the security of the win in Lottery B against the potential higher reward in Lottery A, acknowledging the risk of getting nothing in A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which is also discussed in the verbal report. However, the individual's consideration includes not just the presence of a sure outcome but also the magnitude of the potential wins and the risk of getting nothing. 
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems to balance the security of the win in B against the potential higher but riskier reward in A, without explicitly stating a preference for the lottery without a sure outcome solely because it lacks a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the presence of a sure outcome, which aligns with the decision reason, their justification for the choice seems to involve a more nuanced evaluation that includes the magnitude of potential wins and the risk of losing, rather than strictly preferring the lottery without a sure outcome as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there are two possible outcomes with equal probability: a loss of 1000 Euros and no loss (0 Euros). In Lottery B, there is a sure outcome of losing 500 Euros. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The relevant information is that Lottery A does not have a sure outcome regarding losing money (since there's a 50% chance of losing nothing), while Lottery B has a sure outcome of losing 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the potential loss amount in each lottery and the probability of losing nothing in Lottery A. They noted that the potential loss in Lottery A is twice as high as in Lottery B but also mentioned the 50/50 chance of not losing anything in Lottery A. They considered the certain loss in Lottery B to be ""recht hoch"" (quite high).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to weigh the potential loss against the chance of avoiding any loss. They highlight the advantage of Lottery A as having a chance to lose nothing, which implies they value the absence of a sure loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, and the individual considered the certain loss in Lottery B and the chance of no loss in Lottery A, aligning with the decision reason's focus.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because it offers a chance of not losing anything. The individual's justification emphasizes the benefit of possibly losing nothing in Lottery A, which aligns with preferring a lottery without a sure loss.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they valued the absence of a sure outcome (losing money) in Lottery A.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there are outcomes of 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros, but no single outcome is certain (sure). In Lottery B, there are outcomes of 6000 Euros and 0 Euros, with 0 Euros being more probable but still not certain. However, neither lottery offers a ""sure outcome"" in the sense of a guaranteed win that is the same every time the lottery is played. The decision reason's criteria can be applied by noting that neither lottery has a ""sure"" win in the traditional sense (a guaranteed, non-zero payout), but Lottery B has a more extreme distribution with a higher potential reward and a higher risk of getting nothing. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a guaranteed, non-zero payout in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the amounts won and their probabilities, noting that the amounts in Lottery A are ""geringer"" (smaller) but ""viel wahrscheinlicher"" (much more probable) and that the high risk of getting nothing in Lottery B is a concern.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery A because the amounts are not only more probable but also finds the risk of getting nothing in Lottery B too high.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the absence of a sure outcome, but the individual's reasoning is more about the comparison of probabilities and the risk of getting nothing, rather than the presence or absence of a sure outcome per se.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification is more nuanced, focusing on the balance of probabilities and the avoidance of high risk, rather than explicitly preferring the lottery without a sure outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process as described does not directly align with the decision reason's criteria of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome based on the presence or absence of such outcomes. The individual's focus is more on the comparative probabilities and risk management rather than the specific criterion of a sure outcome.

The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given lotteries, neither Lottery A nor Lottery B offers a sure gain (positive outcome), but both include outcomes of 0 Euros, which can be considered as a form of ""sure outcome"" in the context of not winning. However, the decision reason's applicability hinges on the interpretation of ""sure outcome."" Given that both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome, the decision reason might not directly apply as intended because it seems to look for a lottery with no guaranteed outcome at all, which is not the case here. However, we can infer that the reason is looking for the absence of a guaranteed win or loss. Since both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome, this reason might not directly influence the choice based on the presence or absence of a sure win but could be about the variability of outcomes. The relevant information for this reason is the presence of a 0 Euro outcome in both lotteries and the varying probabilities and amounts of loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a win, that Lottery B has a higher loss amount but it's less probable, and that the amounts in Lottery A are also high but more probable.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be weighing the probabilities and amounts of losses in both lotteries, considering both the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual discusses the probabilities and amounts of losses without explicitly mentioning the preference for a lottery based on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the comparison of loss amounts and their probabilities, not explicitly on the preference for a lottery without a sure outcome. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but since both lotteries have a 0 Euro outcome, this reason does not seem to directly guide the individual's choice as described.

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that the decision reason regarding the preference for a lottery without a sure outcome was used to make the decision. The focus is on comparing the probabilities and amounts of losses rather than the presence or absence of sure outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is a 99.9% chance of winning 0 Euros, which can be considered a sure outcome for practical purposes, but technically, it is not a guaranteed outcome since there is a 0.1% chance of winning 5000 Euros. In Lottery B, there is a 100% chance of winning 5 Euros, which is a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the small win in Lottery B and the small chance of winning something in Lottery A. They also consider not receiving anything (or no loss) as making no big difference.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to focus on the presence of a chance to win something in Lottery A, even though it's small, and views the guaranteed but small win in Lottery B as less appealing due to its small amount. The justification hints at valuing the possibility of a significant win over a guaranteed small win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (presence or absence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (small win in B, small chance of winning in A, and the notion of not receiving anything). The individual does consider aspects related to the certainty of outcomes but does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the absence of a sure outcome.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (valuing the chance of a significant win over a small guaranteed win). The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the focus is more on the potential for a significant win rather than the absence of a sure outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not clearly indicate that they used the decision reason as described. While they consider aspects of the lotteries that relate to sure outcomes, their justification for the choice focuses more on the potential for a significant win rather than the absence of a sure outcome. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In Lottery A, there is a sure outcome of -5 Euros with 100% probability. In Lottery B, there is a 99.9% chance of 0 Euros, which can be considered a sure outcome for practical purposes, and a 0.1% chance of -5000 Euros. Therefore, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Lottery A has a sure outcome, and Lottery B has a nearly sure outcome of 0 Euros but with a small chance of a significant loss.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual notes that neither lottery offers a gain, there's a small loss in Lottery A, and a very high but very unlikely loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers to accept a small, certain loss over a high, unlikely loss, indicating a preference for avoiding the risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence of a sure outcome, but the individual focuses more on the nature of the losses and their probabilities, not directly on the presence or absence of a sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the preference for a small, certain loss over a high, unlikely loss, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. The individual's justification is based on risk aversion regarding the magnitude of potential losses rather than the presence of a sure outcome, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery. From the given lotteries, we can derive the following information relevant to the decision reason: Lottery A has a sure outcome of 1500 Euros, while Lottery B does not have a sure outcome but rather a 50% chance of winning 3000 Euros and a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the following information: The certainty of winning with Lottery A (""Bei A gewinnt man auf jeden Fall und nicht wenig"") and the risk of losing with Lottery B (""Bei B gibt es zu 50% die Chance, viel zu verlieren""). The individual's justification for the choice is based on the risk associated with Lottery B being too high (""Das Risiko ist zu hoch"").

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome) with that considered by the individual (certainty of winning with A and risk of losing with B), it appears the individual is focused on aspects related to the sure outcome but from a risk perspective rather than directly applying the rule of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome. The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery B, but the individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the risk associated with Lottery B, indicating a preference for Lottery A due to its certainty. This suggests the individual did not use the decision reason as stated (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) but instead was influenced by the presence of a sure outcome in a way that led to a preference for the lottery with the sure outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. From the decision problem, we can derive the following relevant information:
- Lottery A has a sure outcome of 2000 Euros.
- Lottery B does not have a sure outcome, offering 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability.
The decision reason can be applied since it is possible to identify the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the sure gain in Lottery A to be very high, acknowledges that the potential gain in Lottery B is higher but notes it's only 50% certain. They also mention the risk of losing a significant amount in Lottery B with the same probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to weigh the certainty of the gain in Lottery A against the risk and potential reward in Lottery B, focusing on the presence of a sure outcome in A and the uncertainty and potential for loss in B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome. The individual also considers the sure outcome in Lottery A and the lack thereof in Lottery B, but they seem to focus more on the trade-off between certainty and risk rather than strictly preferring the lottery without a sure outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not clearly indicate a preference for Lottery B solely because it lacks a sure outcome. Instead, their deliberation seems to balance the pros and cons of each lottery, including the certainty of the outcome in A and the risk/reward profile of B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason as described. The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome based solely on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, but the individual's deliberation process, as described, considers a broader set of factors including the magnitude of potential gains and losses and their probabilities, rather than strictly following the rule of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In this case, Lottery A has no sure outcome (50% chance of 3000 Euros and 50% chance of -3000 Euros), while Lottery B has a sure outcome (1000 Euros with 100% probability). The relevant information for the decision reason is the presence or absence of a sure outcome in each lottery. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the sure outcome of Lottery B (""Bei B gewinnt man auf jeden Fall"" translates to ""With B, you win in any case""), the comparison of the amounts between the two lotteries (""Der Betrag ist zwar viel kleiner als bei A"" translates to ""The amount is much smaller than with A""), and the risk associated with Lottery A (""das Risiko zu hoch, viel zu verlieren"" translates to ""the risk is too high to lose a lot"").

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by mentioning the guarantee of winning with Lottery B and the high risk of losing with Lottery A, indicating a preference for the sure outcome over the potential for higher gain with higher risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the presence or absence of a sure outcome, which is also a key point considered by the individual, as they mention the guarantee of winning with Lottery B.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery without a sure outcome, but the individual's justification suggests a preference for the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B), because it guarantees a win, even though the amount is smaller. This indicates the individual did not follow the decision reason's rule, as they chose the lottery with the sure outcome over the one without.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the presence of a sure outcome in each lottery and prefers the lottery without a sure outcome. In the given decision problem, Lottery A offers 6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability, meaning it does not have a sure outcome. Lottery B offers 0 Euros with 100% probability, which is a sure outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is that Lottery A does not have a sure outcome, while Lottery B does. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that with Lottery B, one wins nothing but also loses nothing, implying consideration of the sure outcome of Lottery B. They also mention the high potential loss in Lottery A, indicating consideration of the risk associated with Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to justify choosing Lottery B because it involves no risk of loss, highlighting the avoidance of the potential high loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (presence of a sure outcome in each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the sure outcome of Lottery B and the risk of Lottery A), it appears the individual did consider the aspect of a sure outcome, at least for Lottery B.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery without a sure outcome) to the individual’s justification (choosing the lottery because it involves no loss, implying preference for the sure outcome), it seems the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual prefers the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B) because it avoids loss, which is opposite to the decision reason’s preference for the lottery without a sure outcome (Lottery A).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's preference for the lottery with a sure outcome (Lottery B) because it avoids loss directly contradicts the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery without a sure outcome (Lottery A). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
