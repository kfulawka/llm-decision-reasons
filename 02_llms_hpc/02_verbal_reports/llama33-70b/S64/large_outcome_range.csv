STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome and the minimum outcome are both 2400 Euros, since it offers a guaranteed 2400 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 2500 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain (""einen garantierten Gewinn hat""), indicating they considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided on Lottery B because it has a guaranteed gain, implying the justification is based on the certainty or security of the outcome rather than the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the guarantee of Lottery B rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its guaranteed outcome, not the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on the guaranteed gain of Lottery B and the lack of mention of the outcome differences between the lotteries suggest that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2400 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 2500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning nothing (0 Euros) and the possible gain (maximum outcome) of each lottery. Specifically, they noted that Lottery B had a probability for winning nothing that was one percentage point lower than Lottery A and that the possible gain in Lottery B was 100 Euros higher than in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of winning nothing and the difference in the maximum outcomes between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and maximum outcomes). While the individual considered the maximum outcomes, they also focused on the probabilities and the direct difference in maximum outcomes between the two lotteries, not explicitly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes within each lottery.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (comparing probabilities and maximum outcomes directly). The decision reason's rule is not directly reflected in the individual's justification, which instead focuses on the comparative aspects of the lotteries' maximum outcomes and the probability of winning nothing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The focus was on comparative probabilities and maximum outcomes rather than the internal differences within each lottery."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is also 3000 Euros (since it's a guaranteed outcome), resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the guaranteed win at Lottery B and compared it to the possible (4 out of 5) win at Lottery A, acknowledging that the guaranteed win at B is lower than the possible win at A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B despite its lower guaranteed win compared to the possible win at Lottery A, implying that the certainty of the outcome at B was a significant factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration is more about the comparison of the guaranteed outcome of B to the possible outcome of A, rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing the guarantee of the outcome as a reason, not the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, I will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery A because it has a larger difference (4000 Euros) between the minimum and maximum outcome compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""Ansehen aller Infos"" which translates to ""considering all information"", but does not specify which information was considered. However, the individual also states that the choice was based on ""Zufallsauswahl"" (random selection) because both lotteries seem ""ziemlich ähnlich"" (quite similar). This implies the individual considered the overall similarity between the lotteries but does not specify what aspects of the lotteries were considered similar.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is that the lotteries seem quite similar, leading to a random selection. There is no explicit mention of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, but the individual's report does not explicitly mention considering these differences. Instead, the individual notes the overall similarity between the lotteries.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome, whereas the individual's justification is based on the perceived similarity between the lotteries, leading to a random choice. The individual does not mention using the rule of comparing outcome differences.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome. The report suggests a random choice due to perceived similarity rather than a systematic comparison of outcome differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are the differences in outcomes for each lottery: 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the size of the winnings and the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting that the winnings in Lottery B are half as large as in Lottery A but the probability of winning is twice as high.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite the lower potential winnings, the probability of winning is higher, and since the decision is a one-time choice, the higher probability outweighs the lower potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is 6000 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the comparison of the winnings and the probabilities, not explicitly on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the probability of winning being higher, not the difference between the outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided, which prioritizes the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the difference is 6000 - 0 = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the difference is 3000 - 0 = 3000 Euros. Since these differences can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the low probability of winning in both cases (1 in 1000 vs. 2 in 1000) and the potential for a double reward.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on the possibility of a ""doppelt so hohen Gewinn,"" which translates to ""possibly double as high a win,"" implying they were drawn to the higher potential reward despite the low probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, we see the individual focused on the potential for a higher win, which aligns with considering the maximum outcomes but does not explicitly mention calculating the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the potential for a double as high a win), there is a conceptual alignment since the individual's choice is influenced by the magnitude of the potential win, which directly relates to the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.

However, the individual's reasoning, as described, does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing these differences as the basis for their decision. Instead, it emphasizes the attractiveness of a potentially higher reward without directly referencing the calculation of outcome differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while there's a conceptual alignment between the decision reason and the individual's justification, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the individual used the specific rule of comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes to make their decision. The individual's focus was more on the potential for a higher win, which is related but not a direct application of the decision reason as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A (1 out of 5, which seems to be a misunderstanding of the 20% chance of winning 0 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides for Lottery A because there's at least a chance (1 out of 5, or 20%) to not lose anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the chance of not losing anything with Lottery A, which does not directly relate to comparing the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's justification is based on the presence of a chance to avoid loss, not explicitly on the differences between the outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery based on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual's focus is on the chance of avoiding loss rather than on comparing the ranges of outcomes between the two lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the magnitude of the loss and its probability, as indicated by ""der Verlust geringer ist (wenn auch etwas wahrscheinlicher)"" which translates to ""the loss is smaller (even if a bit more probable)"".
Second, the individual's justification for the choice is based on the smaller loss of Lottery B compared to Lottery A, despite the slightly higher probability of the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the magnitude of the loss and its probability), it appears the individual focused on the magnitude of the loss rather than the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the smaller loss), it seems the individual did not follow the decision reason's rule. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a larger difference between its outcomes (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros), but the individual chose Lottery B because it has a smaller loss.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, so the difference is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, so the difference is 6000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the individual considers the possible loss of Lottery B being twice as high as Lottery A, and the possibility of 0 Euros being higher for Lottery B. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the comparison of the possible loss and the possibility of 0 Euros between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery) is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the possible loss and the possibility of 0 Euros, but does not explicitly compare the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes. 
Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) does not match the individual's justification for the choice (comparing the possible loss and the possibility of 0 Euros). 
Based on these two comparisons, it seems unlikely that the individual used the decision reason to make the decision.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros (since -6000 Euros is the minimum outcome) and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the loss (Verlust) associated with each lottery and the risk (Risiko) of incurring that loss. Specifically, they noted that the loss in Lottery B is half that of Lottery A but comes with double the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the loss is only half as high as in Lottery A, despite the risk being double.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual, however, talks about the loss being half as high in Lottery B as in Lottery A, which implies a consideration of the outcomes but not exactly in the manner described by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A (6000 Euros difference vs. 3000 Euros difference for Lottery B). However, the individual chose Lottery B because the loss is smaller, which does not align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the size of the loss and the risk associated with it, not on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes as specified by the decision reason.

For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 4000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A because 6000 Euros (difference for A) is greater than 4000 Euros (difference for B). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros and the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 5000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, -5 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the high potential loss of Lottery B but also its low probability, comparing it to the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B seems to be based on the consideration that the high loss of Lottery B is very unlikely, implying a focus on the probability of the outcomes rather than solely on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the high potential loss of Lottery B, its low probability, and the guaranteed low loss of Lottery A), it appears the individual did consider the outcomes but focused more on the probability and the guarantee of the loss rather than the range of outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual's justification (focusing on the probability of the high loss and the guarantee of the low loss), it seems the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger outcome difference, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention this difference as the deciding factor.

The individual's verbal report suggests that while they considered aspects of the lotteries that could relate to the decision reason (outcomes and their implications), their justification for the choice does not directly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery based on the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes. The focus on probability and guaranteed outcomes indicates a different primary consideration. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1500 Euros, because it has a 100% probability of this outcome. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. The difference for Lottery A is 0 (1500 - 1500), and for Lottery B, it is 6000 (3000 - (-3000)). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that with Lottery A, the win is guaranteed (""der Gewinn garantiert ist"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the win is guaranteed.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the guarantee of the win with Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A because it guarantees a win, not because of the difference between its maximum and minimum outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual's justification is based on the guarantee of a win with Lottery A. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 6000 Euros. For Lottery A, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 2000 Euros, since it has a 100% probability of this outcome, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual is not explicitly detailed but implies consideration of the guaranteed win of Lottery A. 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice, as translated from German, seems to focus on the ""guaranteed win"" of Lottery A, suggesting a preference for the certain outcome over the uncertain outcomes of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the differences between maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win of Lottery A), it appears the individual did not explicitly consider the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the guaranteed win), the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual preferred the lottery with the smaller difference (Lottery A) due to its guaranteed outcome, not the size of the outcome difference.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 3000 - (-3000) = 6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 1000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 1000 - 1000 = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery B has a guaranteed gain, while Lottery A has a possible loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the guaranteed gain it offers, as opposed to the potential loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, while the individual considered the presence of a guaranteed gain in one lottery and the possibility of loss in the other. These are not directly comparable as the individual's consideration does not explicitly mention the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on its guaranteed gain, not the difference between outcomes. This suggests the individual did not follow the decision reason's rule.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros, resulting in a difference of 12000 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum and minimum outcome is the same, 0 Euros, resulting in a difference of 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions considering all information (""Ansehen aller Infos"") and the possibility of a win with Lottery A (""Gewinn möglich"").
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because a win is possible (""darum A""), implying the potential for a positive outcome was a factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the possibility of a win, which aligns with noting the maximum outcome but does not directly address the difference between maximum and minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome. The individual's justification is based on the possibility of a win, not explicitly on the difference between outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason. While the individual is drawn to Lottery A because of the possibility of a win, this does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the range of outcomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual."
