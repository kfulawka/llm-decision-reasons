0,"STEP 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery to determine the preferred lottery. From Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. From Lottery B, both the maximum and minimum outcomes are 2400 Euros, as there is only one possible outcome. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Maximum = 2500 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum = 2400 Euros, Minimum = 2400 Euros
Since we can derive the necessary information, we proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and the maximum outcome.
- For Lottery A, the difference is 2500 - 0 = 2500 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the difference is 2400 - 2400 = 0 Euros.
Since 0 Euros (difference for Lottery B) is less than 2500 Euros (difference for Lottery A), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.
