"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem:
   - The relevant information for the decision reason is the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery.
   - Lottery A:
     - Maximum outcome: 2500 Euros
     - Minimum outcome: 0 Euros
     - Difference: 2500 Euros - 0 Euros = 2500 Euros
   - Lottery B:
     - Maximum outcome: 2400 Euros
     - Minimum outcome: 2400 Euros
     - Difference: 2400 Euros - 2400 Euros = 0 Euros
   - The relevant information has been derived.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem:
   - According to the decision reason, the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome is preferred.
   - Lottery A difference: 2500 Euros
   - Lottery B difference: 0 Euros
   - The decision reason prefers Lottery A, as it has a larger difference (2500 Euros > 0 Euros).

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS: 
1. Assess the relevant information:
   - Lottery A outcomes: Maximum = 2500 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B outcomes: Maximum = 2400 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
   - Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum outcome for each lottery:
     - Difference for Lottery A: 2500 Euros - 0 Euros = 2500 Euros
     - Difference for Lottery B: 2400 Euros - 0 Euros = 2400 Euros

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - The reason states to prefer the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcomes.
   - Difference for Lottery A is 2500 Euros.
   - Difference for Lottery B is 2400 Euros.
   - Since 2500 Euros (Lottery A) > 2400 Euros (Lottery B), the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner:
   - The decision reason requires the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries.
   - For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros.
   - For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 3000 Euros, and the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros. 
   - Relevant information for Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 4000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros, Difference = 4000 - 0 = 4000 Euros.
   - Relevant information for Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 3000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 3000 Euros, Difference = 3000 - 3000 = 0 Euros.

2. Apply the decision reason to the decision problem by strictly following the decision reason’s rule:
   - The reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum outcome.
   - Lottery A has a difference of 4000 Euros.
   - Lottery B has a difference of 0 Euros.
   - Hence, the reason prefers Lottery A because 4000 Euros is greater than 0 Euros.

FINAL ANSWER: A"
"STEPS:
1. Determine the maximum and minimum outcomes for both lotteries:
   - Lottery A: maximum = 4000 Euros, minimum = 0 Euros
   - Lottery B: maximum = 3000 Euros, minimum = 0 Euros

2. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum outcomes for each lottery:
   - Lottery A: 4000 Euros - 0 Euros = 4000 Euros
   - Lottery B: 3000 Euros - 0 Euros = 3000 Euros

3. Compare the differences:
   - Difference for Lottery A = 4000 Euros
   - Difference for Lottery B = 3000 Euros

4. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference:
   - Lottery A has a larger difference (4000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (3000 Euros).
