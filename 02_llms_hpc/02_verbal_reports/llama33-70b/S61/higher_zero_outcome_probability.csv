STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 1%, and for Lottery B, the probability of a zero outcome is 0% (since it offers 2400 Euros with 100% probability). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 1% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""Verlustchance von 1%"" (a loss chance of 1%) being ""praktisch irrelevant"" (practically irrelevant) and compares it with a ""Chance von 33%"" (a chance of 33%) being ""signifikant"" (significant). This suggests the individual is considering the probabilities associated with the outcomes but does not directly mention comparing the zero-outcome probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating the ""nahezu ignorierbare Risiko, leer auszugehen"" (the nearly negligible risk of getting nothing) was worth it to ""meinen wahrscheinlichen Gewinn zu erhöhen"" (increase my probable gain). This implies the individual is weighing the risk of getting nothing against the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which is mentioned in the verbal report but not as the primary focus. The individual discusses the 1% chance in the context of it being negligible rather than directly comparing zero-outcome probabilities between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A in this case. However, the individual's justification seems to prioritize the potential for a higher gain over the negligible risk of getting nothing, rather than explicitly preferring a higher chance of a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. The individual's focus is on the negligible risk of getting nothing as part of a broader consideration of potential gains, rather than directly comparing and preferring based on zero-outcome probabilities."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities: Lottery B has a 67% probability of a zero outcome, and Lottery A has a 66% probability of a zero outcome. This information is crucial for the decision reason, which prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but found it not entirely unrealistic. The individual's focus was on whether the potential loss of 100 Euros in prize money was worth the increase in the winning chance by one percentage point. The individual prioritized mitigating the risk of losing over having 100 Euros more in the winning case. The justification for the choice seems to revolve around risk mitigation and the value of increasing the winning chance, rather than directly comparing the probabilities of the zero outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of zero outcomes) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing, value of increasing the winning chance), there seems to be a discrepancy. The decision reason specifically focuses on the probability of the zero outcome, whereas the individual's deliberation process is more about risk mitigation and the trade-off between the potential loss and the increase in winning probability. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a higher probability of a zero outcome; instead, it emphasizes the value of slightly increasing the winning chance. Given this, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0"
3,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. In the given lotteries, Lottery B has a 20% probability of a zero outcome (0 Euros), and Lottery A has a 0% probability of a zero outcome since it guarantees 3000 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B: 20% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery A: 0% chance of 0 Euros (or 100% chance of a non-zero outcome)

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros with Lottery B, acknowledging the 20% probability of getting 0 Euros, and compared it with the certainty of getting 3000 Euros from Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), which refers to Lottery A, because the risk of losing with Lottery B, although small (20%), was not negligible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which is 20% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A. The individual considered the risk associated with Lottery B, specifically the 20% chance of getting 0 Euros, but ultimately chose Lottery A because it was the safe option, avoiding the risk of getting 0 Euros.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery B in this case. However, the individual chose Lottery A, the lottery with a 0% chance of a zero outcome, because they wanted to avoid the risk associated with Lottery B, not because they preferred the higher probability of a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual did not use the decision reason as described. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, but the individual chose the lottery that avoids the zero outcome altogether, indicating they prioritized avoiding risk over the specific decision reason provided."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 75%, and for Lottery B, it is 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. Based on the decision reason, Lottery B would be preferred because it has a higher probability of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions a comparison with another lottery scenario (2400€-34% and 2500€-33%) and discusses the value of significantly increasing success chances over maximizing potential gain in low-probability, realistic lotteries. 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prioritizes increasing success chances significantly over maximizing potential gain, indicating a focus on probability rather than the amount of the potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of zero outcomes) with that considered by the individual (comparing probabilities and the value of increasing success chances), it seems the individual does consider probabilities but focuses on increasing success chances, not specifically on the probability of zero outcomes as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification (prioritizing increasing success chances), there appears to be a mismatch. The individual’s justification is about maximizing the chance of a positive outcome rather than preferring a higher chance of a zero outcome.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process does not align with the decision reason provided, which specifically prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. The individual's focus is on increasing the chances of a positive outcome, not on preferring a higher probability of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 55%, and for Lottery B, it is 10%. This information is directly derivable from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable. The relevant information is: Lottery A has a 55% chance of a zero outcome, and Lottery B has a 10% chance of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability (90%) of winning in Lottery B as ""almost guaranteed"" and valued the option based on this. They also considered the amount of 3000 Euros as a ""pretty high win value"" and compared the risk of Lottery A's 45% chance against the more secure option of Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery B because its high probability of winning made it seem like a more secure route for achieving a gain, as opposed to risking everything on a 45% chance with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's consideration was more about the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B and the security it offered, rather than the probability of a zero outcome.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on its high probability of a positive outcome and the perceived security, not the avoidance of a zero outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. Instead, their choice was influenced by the perceived security and high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. In the given lotteries, A and B, the probabilities of a zero outcome are 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be directly derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that the probabilities of winning in both cases are so low that they become practically negligible. They also mention considering the height of the prize money in case of a win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their decision based on the height of the prize money when they happen to win, implying that if they were lucky enough to beat a 0.2% chance, they could also overcome a 0.1% chance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's consideration is more about the low probability of winning and the prize amount, not directly comparing the probabilities of the zero outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the potential winnings, not the probability of not winning. The individual's decision seems to be influenced more by the potential gain rather than the probability of the zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on the height of the prize money and the low probabilities of winning, rather than on comparing the probabilities of the zero outcomes as the decision reason suggests. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. 
In the given decision problem, Lottery A has a 20% probability of a zero outcome (0 Euros), and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a zero outcome since it guarantees a loss of 3000 Euros. 
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the zero outcome for each lottery: 20% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of no loss (zero outcome) in Lottery 1 (20% chance of no loss) and the certain loss in Lottery 2, comparing the potential loss amounts between the two options.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual aimed to minimize the realistically probable loss, considering the 20% chance of no loss in Lottery 1 as too low to justify the additional potential loss of 1000 Euros compared to the certain loss in Lottery 2.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which is mentioned in the verbal report as a consideration (20% chance of no loss in Lottery 1).
However, the primary focus of the individual seems to be on minimizing the probable loss rather than maximizing the probability of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A due to its 20% chance of no loss.
In contrast, the individual's justification emphasizes minimizing the probable loss, leading them to prefer Lottery B despite its 0% chance of a zero outcome, because the certain loss is seen as less risky than the potential for a larger loss in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. The individual prioritized minimizing the probable loss over maximizing the chance of no loss, indicating that the decision reason was not used to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 80%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. This information is directly derivable from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential losses, indicating that higher loss amounts are valued more negatively than gain amounts are valued positively.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual was not willing to risk a larger loss to reduce the chance of that loss by 5 percentage points, suggesting a focus on minimizing potential losses rather than directly comparing the probabilities of zero outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of zero outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and potential losses), there seems to be a partial alignment since the individual did consider probabilities but focused more on the aspect of loss aversion.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on minimizing potential losses), it appears that the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual's main concern was the magnitude of potential losses rather than the probability of avoiding any loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on minimizing potential losses and the valuation of loss amounts over the reduction of loss probabilities does not align with the decision reason that specifically considers the probability of a zero outcome to make a choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. In Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 10%, and in Lottery B, it is 55%. The information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of zero outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high loss amounts in both options, the attractive option of reducing the loss probability from 90% to 45%, and the risk of a much higher loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to take the ""sichere Route"" (safe route), avoiding the potential for a loss of 6000 Euros, implying they preferred the option with the lower risk of a significant loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's considerations were more about avoiding a high loss and reducing the risk of a significant loss, rather than specifically focusing on the probability of a zero outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome (which would be Lottery B with 55%), but the individual's justification does not align with this rule. Instead, the individual preferred the option that avoids the higher potential loss, which is Lottery A, despite its lower probability of a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's justification focuses on avoiding a high loss and does not indicate a preference based on the probability of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 99.9%, and for Lottery B, it is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of not winning (0 Euros) in each lottery. Therefore, the relevant information is: Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of a zero outcome, and Lottery B has a 99.8% chance of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probabilities of winning (0.1% and 0.2%) and considers them ""ungefähr gleich irrelevant"" (approximately equally irrelevant) for a single trial. The focus then shifts to minimizing the penalty (Strafbetrag) in a theoretical unfortunate case, implying consideration of the negative outcomes (-6000 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual aims to minimize the penalty in case of an unfortunate outcome, which suggests a focus on the negative outcomes rather than the probabilities of the zero outcomes directly.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probabilities of zero outcomes, which are 99.9% for Lottery A and 99.8% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discusses the irrelevance of the winning probabilities and the desire to minimize the penalty, not directly addressing the probabilities of zero outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, is about minimizing the penalty in case of losing, which does not directly align with preferring a lottery based on the probability of a zero outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process did not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the focus was on minimizing loss rather than on the probabilities of zero outcomes.

The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 50%, and for Lottery B, the probability of a zero outcome is 0% since it offers 500 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities: Lottery A has a higher probability of a zero outcome than Lottery B. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the mathematical value of both options, implying they looked at the expected outcomes, and also considered the aspect of ensuring an increase in their winnings given previous additional rewards.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred ensuring their winnings increased over maximizing the potential for further gain, indicating a preference for a guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which doesn't directly align with the individual's consideration of mathematical value and ensuring an increase in winnings.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification emphasizes the value of a guaranteed increase, which aligns more with preferring Lottery B, as it guarantees a win.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on ensuring an increase in their winnings and the mathematical value of the options, along with their preference for a guaranteed outcome, does not align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, there's a 50% probability of a zero outcome (0 Euros), and for Lottery B, there's a 0% probability of a zero outcome since it guarantees a loss of 500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: 50% chance of 0 Euros
- Lottery B: 0% chance of 0 Euros

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""50% sind immernoch eine relevante Chance auf ein Ergebnis,"" which translates to ""50% is still a relevant chance of an outcome."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of an outcome, specifically the 50% chance associated with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided ""den absoluten möglichen Verlustwert zu minimieren,"" which translates to ""to minimize the absolute possible loss value."" This indicates the individual's focus was on minimizing potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, and the individual considered the 50% chance of an outcome, which aligns with the probability of the zero outcome in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A with its 50% chance of 0 Euros. The individual aimed to minimize the absolute possible loss, which could align with preferring a lottery that offers a chance of no loss (0 Euros), but the direct focus is on minimizing loss rather than maximizing the probability of no loss.

Given these comparisons, the individual's consideration of the probability and the aim to minimize loss could indirectly align with the decision reason, but the verbal report does not directly state a preference based on the probability of a zero outcome. The focus on minimizing loss could lead to choosing Lottery A because it offers a chance of no loss, but it's more about the absolute loss value than the probability of avoiding any loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment indicates that while there are elements in the verbal report that could suggest the decision reason was considered (like the mention of the 50% chance), the primary justification provided (minimizing absolute loss) does not directly align with the decision reason's rule (preferring the higher probability of a zero outcome). Thus, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but there's a slight inclination towards it not being the primary reason due to the focus on loss minimization rather than the probability of avoiding loss."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, I will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 75%, and for Lottery B, it is 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the comparison of these probabilities. Since Lottery A has a higher probability of a zero outcome (75%) than Lottery B (50%), according to the decision reason, Lottery A should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amounts of money (noting all were four-digit, thus significant) and the probability of winning a large amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual based their decision on which option gave them a greater probability of winning a large amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of zero outcomes) with that considered by the individual (amounts of money and probability of winning a large amount): The individual does not mention considering the probability of a zero outcome, which is crucial for the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the option with a greater probability of winning a large amount): The individual's justification is based on winning a large amount, not on the probability of a zero outcome, which directly contradicts the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 50%, and for Lottery B, it is 75%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:

- Lottery B: 75% chance of 0 Euros
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of losses in both lotteries and the impact of minimizing the chance of loss, indicating they looked at the probabilities and outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prioritized minimizing the chance of loss, specifically mentioning a 25 percentage point difference in the chance of not losing (which seems to refer to the difference in zero-outcome probabilities between the two lotteries), over reducing the loss amount in the unlikely event of a bad outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of minimizing the chance of loss and the mention of a specific percentage point difference in the chance of not losing.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes minimizing the chance of loss, which suggests they preferred the option with a higher probability of not losing, aligning with the decision reason’s rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual considered the same factors as the decision reason (probability of zero outcome) and made their choice based on a similar rule (preferring the option that minimizes the chance of loss, which in this context means preferring the higher probability of a zero outcome).

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 99.9%, and for Lottery B, since it guarantees 5 Euros, the probability of a zero outcome is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This information is: Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of a zero outcome, and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the probability of winning (0.1% for Lottery A) and seems to consider the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B. The individual downplays the significance of the 0.1% chance, indicating it is ""realistisch irrelevant"" (realistically irrelevant), suggesting they are focusing on the practical aspect of the guaranteed win in Lottery B.

Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers a guaranteed small win over the illusion of a jackpot, indicating a preference for certainty over a very low-probability high reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome. The individual, while not directly comparing the probabilities of zero outcomes, does consider the practical implications of these probabilities by preferring the guaranteed outcome (which implies a consideration of the zero outcome probability indirectly).

Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification is based on preferring a guaranteed small win (Lottery B) over the chance of a higher win (Lottery A), which suggests they are not following the decision reason's rule. The individual's focus is on the certainty of a gain rather than the probability of not gaining anything.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on preferring a guaranteed win over a very low probability of a high win, which does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. For Lottery A, the probability of a zero outcome is 99.9%, and for Lottery B, since there's no chance of winning or getting zero (as the outcome is a fixed loss), the probability of a zero outcome is effectively 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A has a 99.9% chance of a 0 Euro outcome.
- Lottery B has a 0% chance of a 0 Euro outcome, as it guarantees a loss of 5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: 
The individual initially found the potential loss in Lottery A unattractive but then considered the probability distribution, noting the extremely low probability (0.1%) of the loss in Lottery A, making the risk of losing seem negligible. They considered the effective guarantee of not losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A due to its high probability.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery A by considering the negligible risk of the loss due to its low probability, implying that the high probability of getting 0 Euros made Lottery A more attractive.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which aligns with the individual’s consideration of the high probability (99.9%) of getting 0 Euros in Lottery A.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which aligns with the individual’s reasoning that the high probability of not losing (getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A made it more attractive.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual’s decision process aligns with the decision reason provided, as they preferred Lottery A due to its higher probability of a zero outcome, which is the core principle of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. 
For Lottery A, there is no outcome of exactly 0 Euros, but rather outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, each with 50% probability. The expected value (or mean outcome) is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros, but this does not directly relate to the probability of a zero outcome, as zero is not an outcome. 
For Lottery B, there is a 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros, meaning there is a 0% chance of a zero outcome.
Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason (probability of a zero outcome) is: Lottery A has no direct zero outcome but has outcomes that balance to a zero expected value, and Lottery B has no chance of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the expected value (Mittelwert) of each lottery, noting that Lottery A would average out to 0 Euros over many attempts, while Lottery B offers a guaranteed 1500 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice based on the guaranteed nature of Lottery B's outcome and its positive expected value compared to the zero expected value of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, which is not directly considered by the individual in the verbal report. The individual discusses expected values and the guaranteed nature of one of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, but the individual's justification is based on the guaranteed positive outcome of Lottery B and its comparison to the expected value of Lottery A, not the probability of a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate consideration of the probability of a zero outcome as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on expected values and the guaranteed outcome of one lottery suggests a different decision-making process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery. For Lottery B, there's a 0% chance of a zero outcome since the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, both with 50% probability. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not include a zero outcome. However, since neither lottery offers a zero outcome, we must interpret the reason in the context of the given options. The information relevant to the decision reason is that neither lottery provides a zero outcome, but Lottery A guarantees a positive outcome, while Lottery B has a risk of a negative outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a previous similar decision and notes that the safe option (Lottery A, in this case, offering 2000 Euros with 100% probability) is now even more attractive. They compare the current decision to past experiences where the choice was between a risky option (like Lottery B) and a guaranteed, but lower, amount (initially 1500 Euros, now 2000 Euros in the current scenario).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds the decision ""selfverständlich"" (obvious or straightforward), implying that the attractiveness of the safe option made the choice easy.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of a zero outcome, but since neither lottery offers this, the comparison isn't directly applicable. However, the individual's consideration of the guaranteed nature of one option (Lottery A) versus the risk of the other (Lottery B) shows an awareness of the outcomes' certainty.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, but since neither lottery offers a zero outcome, this rule doesn't directly apply. The individual's justification is based on the attractiveness of the guaranteed option, which aligns with preferring a certain positive outcome over a risky one but doesn't explicitly mention the probability of a zero outcome as the reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The decision reason specifically considers the probability of a zero outcome, which is not a factor in the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the guaranteed nature of one option versus the risk of the other, without mention of zero outcomes. Thus, it's clear that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, there is no outcome with a value of zero; instead, it has outcomes of 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros, both with 50% probability. Lottery B has an outcome of 1000 Euros with 100% probability, which also does not include a zero outcome. However, to apply the decision reason, we must infer that it implicitly considers the absence of a zero outcome as the basis for comparison. Thus, both lotteries do not have a zero outcome, but Lottery B has a fixed, positive outcome, which could be interpreted as having an implicit ""zero probability of a zero outcome"" in the context of this specific decision reason. The relevant information for the decision reason is that neither lottery offers a zero outcome, but the reason's rule would likely be applied by considering the certainty of a non-zero outcome in Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual includes the guaranteed win of 1000 Euros in Lottery B and the comparison of this amount to the expected value (Mittelwert) of Lottery A. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on the comparison between the guaranteed win in Lottery B and the expected value of Lottery A, highlighting that the guaranteed win, although significantly less than the potential win in Lottery A, is more than the expected value of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of a zero outcome or its implicit consideration) with that considered by the individual (guaranteed win vs. expected value), there seems to be a mismatch. The individual does not explicitly discuss the probability of a zero outcome or its absence in either lottery. 
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome) to the individual's justification (comparison of guaranteed win to expected value), there is no direct alignment. The individual's focus is on the value of the outcomes rather than the probability of achieving a zero outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome. The focus of the individual is on comparing the guaranteed win of one lottery to the expected value of the other, without mention or implication of considering the probability of a zero outcome as the basis for the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of a zero outcome for each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of the zero outcome. In Lottery A, there is a 100% probability of a zero outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), and in Lottery B, there is a 0% probability of a zero outcome since both outcomes are either 6000 Euros or -6000 Euros, each with 50% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a 100% chance of a zero outcome, and Lottery B has a 0% chance of a zero outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the fact that one of the options (Lottery A) had no risk (implied by ""keine Lotterie war""), and for the other option (Lottery B), they considered the potential loss of 6000 Euros as a significant factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by excluding Lottery B due to the potential significant loss, mentioning that the probabilities became irrelevant after considering the potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focused on the absence of risk in Lottery A and the potential significant loss in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of a zero outcome (since Lottery A's certain outcome of 0 Euros can be seen as having no risk).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, which is Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on avoiding the risk of a significant loss present in Lottery B, which indirectly aligns with preferring the certain zero outcome of Lottery A over the risky outcomes of Lottery B.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process seems to align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of a zero outcome, as they essentially chose the option that guaranteed no loss (or a zero outcome) over the option that carried a risk of significant loss.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment indicates a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, given the alignment between the decision reason's criteria and the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. However, it's not a perfect match since the verbal report focuses more on the avoidance of risk rather than explicitly stating a preference for the higher probability of a zero outcome."
