Decision reason:
The reason considers the products of the maximum outcome and its probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher product.
<|assistant|>
STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied: The decision reason involves the products of the maximum outcome and its probability. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability (product: 0 * 0.2 = 0). For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability (product: -3000 * 1 = -3000). The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied.
2. Apply the decision reason: According to the decision reason, we compute the product for each lottery. For Lottery A, the product is 0 (from 0 Euros * 20% probability). For Lottery B, the product is -3000 (from -3000 Euros * 100% probability). The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher product. Since 0 is greater than -3000, the decision reason does not prefer Lottery B. However, since we are comparing 0 (Lottery A) and -3000 (Lottery B), and 0 is not less than -3000, we must clarify that the decision reason strictly prefers the higher positive value or avoids the lower negative value. Since Lottery A has a product of 0 (no loss when the low probability event happens), and Lottery B guarantees a loss of -3000, the decision reason prefers Lottery A to avoid the larger guaranteed loss.

FINAL ANSWER:
