STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 2400 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0 + 2400) / 4 = 1825 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1825 = 675, 2400 - 1825 = 575, and 0 - 1825 = -1825; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1825 = 575. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considers the safety of the gain in Lottery B and the risk in Lottery A. They mention the low risk of losing in Lottery B but also note that the difference in the amount to be won is too low for them to take the risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual prioritizes the safety of the gain, implying that the certainty of winning in Lottery B is more important than the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's verbal report does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or the calculation of differences from such a level. Instead, they focus on the safety of the gain and the risk involved.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification, however, is based on the safety of the gain and the risk associated with each lottery, not explicitly on the probability of positive differences from an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of an aspiration level or the consideration of positive differences from such a level as described by the decision reason. Their focus on safety and risk does not align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 2500 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2400 Euros and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (2500 + 0 + 2400 + 0) / 4 = 1225 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 2500 - 1225 = 1275 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros; for Lottery B, 2400 - 1225 = 1175 Euros and 0 - 1225 = -1225 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 33% chance of a positive difference (1275 Euros) and a 67% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros), while Lottery B has a 34% chance of a positive difference (1175 Euros) and a 66% chance of a negative difference (-1225 Euros). This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that in both lotteries, they would not suffer a loss, implying they acknowledged the outcomes of 0 Euros in both lotteries do not represent a loss but rather a neutral outcome or no gain. They also considered the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount of the win, noting they chose the lower probability of success for a higher gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the lower probability of winning against the potential for a higher gain, opting for the higher gain despite the lower probability of achieving it.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing the probabilities of outcomes being above this level. The individual's consideration of the outcomes and their implicit acknowledgment of preferring a higher gain suggests they might have intuitively considered the differences in outcomes, but there's no explicit mention of calculating or considering an aspiration level or the specific probabilities of being above such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual preferred the lottery with the higher potential gain despite its lower probability, which aligns with preferring positive outcomes but does not directly address the concept of an aspiration level or the comparison of probabilities of positive differences from such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of the trade-offs between the probability of winning and the amount of the win, which aligns somewhat with the concept of evaluating outcomes. However, there is no explicit mention or clear implication that the individual calculated or considered an aspiration level or the specific probabilities of positive differences from such a level as required by the decision reason. Thus, while there's a superficial alignment in preferring higher gains, the underlying reasoning process described does not closely match the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros and 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (3000 + 4000 + 0) / 3 = 2333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 2333.33 = 666.67 Euros; for Lottery B, 4000 - 2333.33 = 1666.67 Euros and 0 - 2333.33 = -2333.33 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 100% chance of a positive difference and Lottery B has an 80% chance of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of winning with Lottery A (100% chance) and the higher potential gain but also the risk of losing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the security of winning (Lottery A) over the risk of losing (associated with Lottery B), despite acknowledging the higher potential gain of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the certainty of gain and the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences from an aspiration level but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which in this case would be Lottery A due to its 100% chance of a positive outcome relative to the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on preferring the security of a certain gain over the risk of loss, which aligns with preferring a lottery that guarantees a positive outcome but does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the specific steps and considerations of the decision reason, such as calculating an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences. While the individual's preference for security over risk indirectly aligns with the outcome of the decision reason in this specific case, the reasoning process described does not closely follow the decision reason's rule. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual in the manner it is defined."
4,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, 0 Euros, 4000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (3000 + 0 + 4000 + 0) / 4 = 7000 / 4 = 1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are important. For Lottery A, the differences are (3000 - 1750) and (0 - 1750), which are 1250 and -1750, respectively. For Lottery B, the differences are (4000 - 1750) and (0 - 1750), which are 2250 and -1750, respectively. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 25% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 20% (since only the 4000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). Thus, according to the decision reason, Lottery A would be preferred because it has a higher probability (25%) of a positive difference compared to Lottery B (20%). The information relevant to the decision reason includes the aspiration level, the differences between outcomes and this level, and the probabilities of positive differences for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of winning in both lotteries to be similar but notes that Lottery A has a 5% higher chance of winning, albeit with a lower payout. The individual also acknowledges the high risk of losing in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides to choose Lottery B because it offers a higher potential gain if the 20% probability of winning occurs, compared to the potential gain in Lottery A. The individual is willing to take the higher risk due to the potential for a greater reward, given that both lotteries have a low chance of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the probabilities of winning, the amounts that can be won, and the risk of losing, but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. However, the individual chooses Lottery B based on the potential for a higher gain despite recognizing both lotteries have low winning chances. This suggests the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual's focus is on the potential gain and the willingness to take a higher risk for a greater reward, which does not reflect the specific rule of the decision reason in question. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean of these outcomes is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 4500 Euros. This is the aspiration level. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 4500 = 1500, 0 - 4500 = -4500, 3000 - 4500 = -1500, and 0 - 4500 = -4500. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference (1500) is 45%, and in Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0% since both differences are negative (-1500). However, we must consider the context of the decision reason which focuses on the probability of outcomes being above the aspiration level. Since neither outcome in Lottery A exceeds the aspiration level, and only one outcome in Lottery B does, we proceed with understanding how this applies to the individual's decision-making process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery and the amount of the win.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of winning is higher, despite the lower amount of the win.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and comparing outcomes to it, focusing on the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focused on the probability of winning and the win amount without mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of outcomes above the aspiration level, which in this case would be Lottery B because it has a chance (45%) of exceeding the aspiration level, whereas Lottery A does not. The individual, however, chose Lottery A based on a higher probability of winning, not explicitly considering an aspiration level or the concept of outcomes being above or below such a level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not align with the decision reason's focus on an aspiration level and the probability of outcomes exceeding it. The individual's justification is based on the probability of winning and the amount of the win, without reference to an aspiration level or comparing outcomes against it. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 6000 Euros, 0 Euros, 3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is (6000 + 0 + 3000 + 0) / 4 = 2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: 6000 - 2250 = 3750, 0 - 2250 = -2250, 3000 - 2250 = 750, and 0 - 2250 = -2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

In Lottery B, the probability of a positive difference is 0.1% (since only the 6000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level), and in Lottery A, the probability of a positive difference is 0.2% (since only the 3000 Euros outcome is above the aspiration level). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that in both lotteries, they incur no losses, implying they consider the outcomes of 0 Euros as not negative but rather as a baseline or neutral outcome. They then decide based on the ""geringere Gewinnchance mit höherem Gewinn,"" which translates to ""lower chance of winning with a higher win."" This suggests the individual considers the probability of winning and the amount of the win.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the lottery with a lower chance of winning but a higher potential win, which in this case is Lottery B with a 0.1% chance of winning 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of outcomes being above this level. The individual, however, focuses on the absence of losses and the trade-off between the probability of winning and the amount of the win, without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which would be Lottery A in this case because it has a higher probability (0.2%) of an outcome (3000 Euros) being above the aspiration level than Lottery B (0.1% for 6000 Euros). The individual, however, chooses Lottery B because it offers a higher win with a lower chance, which aligns with preferring higher outcomes but does not directly relate to the decision reason’s focus on probabilities of exceeding an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the individual does not consider an aspiration level or the probability of outcomes exceeding such a level in their justification.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-4000 + 0 - 3000) / 3 = -3000 / 3 = -1000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -4000 - (-1000) = -3000 and 0 - (-1000) = 1000; for Lottery B, -3000 - (-1000) = -2000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, Lottery A has a 20% chance of a positive difference (0 Euros being 1000 Euros above the aspiration level) and an 80% chance of a negative difference (-4000 Euros being -3000 Euros below the aspiration level). Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference since its outcome is -2000 Euros below the aspiration level. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions preferring the option where they ""keinen Verlust erzielen zu können"" which translates to ""can't achieve a loss"" or more naturally, ""might not lose."" This suggests the individual is considering the potential for avoiding a loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification is about preferring an option where they might not lose over an option where they lose with certainty. This indicates the individual is focusing on the aspect of avoiding certain loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on avoiding a loss, which can be related to the concept of positive differences from an aspiration level but does not explicitly mention probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers avoiding a certain loss, which aligns with seeking positive (or less negative) outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of being above an aspiration level.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding loss can be seen as related to the concept of preferring positive differences from an aspiration level, but the explicit consideration of probabilities and the calculation of an aspiration level as defined by the decision reason are not clearly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while there is a vague alignment between the individual's preference for avoiding loss and the decision reason's focus on positive differences from an aspiration level, the explicit steps and considerations of the decision reason (calculating aspiration level, considering probabilities of positive differences) are not clearly reflected in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined, but there is a slight possibility due to the overlapping concern with avoiding losses."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level is thus (-4000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -1750 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -4000 Euros, the difference is -4000 - (-1750) = -2250; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-1750) = -1250; and for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-1750) = 1750. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the outcomes and their probabilities, we can calculate the probability of positive differences for each lottery. For Lottery B, the positive difference (1750) occurs with 80% probability, and for Lottery A, it also occurs with 75% probability. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of losing in both lotteries and notes that these probabilities are less than the probability of not losing (which is implicitly 0% since all outcomes are either losses or 0). The individual focuses on the potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses the option where they would lose less, since there is no chance of winning anything. The justification is based on minimizing loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on minimizing losses without explicitly mentioning an aspiration level or the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, while the individual prefers the lottery with the lesser loss, as there's no chance of gain. The individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule about positive differences from an aspiration level.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0)/4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and this aspiration level are important. For Lottery A, the differences are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750, 0 - (-2250) = 2250, -3000 - (-2250) = -750, and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. For Lottery B, the relevant differences are -6000 - (-2250) = -3750 and 0 - (-2250) = 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Given the aspiration level and the differences, we can derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, there's a 90% chance of a -3000 Euro outcome (which is a negative difference from the aspiration level) and a 10% chance of a 0 Euro outcome (which is a positive difference). For Lottery B, there's a 45% chance of a -6000 Euro outcome (negative difference) and a 55% chance of a 0 Euro outcome (positive difference). Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason includes the probabilities of outcomes relative to the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss (i.e., getting 0 Euros) as the primary factor for their decision.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on preferring the higher probability of not incurring a loss, even if it means accepting a higher potential loss. This implies the individual is focusing on the avoidance of loss rather than the absolute value of the potential outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, while the individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss. These perspectives align in the sense that both involve evaluating outcomes based on their desirability (positive difference or no loss), but the individual's focus is more on the absolute avoidance of loss rather than the relative difference from an aspiration level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the lottery with the higher probability of not incurring a loss, which can be seen as a form of focusing on positive outcomes (or less negative, in this context). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention an aspiration level or comparisons to such a level, suggesting a simpler decision rule based on loss avoidance.

Based on these comparisons, while the individual's decision process shares some similarities with the decision reason (focusing on desirable outcomes), it does not explicitly align with the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from an aspiration level. The individual's focus is more straightforward, on avoiding losses, without mention of calculating or considering an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while there are some conceptual similarities between the individual's decision process and the decision reason (such as focusing on desirable outcomes), the individual's justification and considered information do not closely align with the specific rule and process outlined by the decision reason, particularly the calculation and consideration of an aspiration level."

For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros, 0 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean (aspiration level) is (-6000 + 0 - 3000 + 0) / 4 = -2250 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for -6000 Euros, the difference is -6000 - (-2250) = -3750; for 0 Euros, the difference is 0 - (-2250) = 2250; for -3000 Euros, the difference is -3000 - (-2250) = -750; and for 0 Euros, the difference is the same as above, 2250. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. In this case, a positive difference occurs when the outcome is 0 Euros. Thus, we need to compare the probabilities of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries. Lottery A gives 0 Euros with 99.8% probability, and Lottery B gives 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions deciding based on the ""höchste Wahrscheinlichkeit keinen Verlust zu erzielen,"" which translates to the ""highest probability of not incurring a loss."" This implies the individual considered the probabilities of not losing (i.e., getting 0 Euros) in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is to choose the option with the highest probability of not incurring a loss, which directly relates to the probability of getting 0 Euros in both lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this context, translates to the probability of getting 0 Euros (a positive difference from the aspiration level of -2250 Euros). The individual considered the probability of not incurring a loss, which aligns with the probability of getting 0 Euros.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences (in this case, not incurring a loss or getting 0 Euros), and the individual chose based on the highest probability of not incurring a loss. This alignment suggests the individual's decision process matches the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's focus on the highest probability of not incurring a loss directly aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level, which in this context, means not losing (getting 0 Euros). The verbal report clearly indicates the individual considered and based their decision on the same criteria as the decision reason, leading to a high confidence assessment that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason based on the verbal report, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The aspiration level (AL) is calculated as (1000 + 0 + 500) / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 1000 - 500 = 500 (positive) and 0 - 500 = -500 (negative); for Lottery B, 500 - 500 = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the probabilities, Lottery A has a 50% chance of a positive difference (1000 Euros) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (0 Euros), while Lottery B has a 0% chance of a positive difference (since the outcome equals the aspiration level) and a 0% chance of a negative difference. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that in this lottery, there are no losses for them, indicating they consider the absence of negative outcomes (losses) as a factor. They also compare a ""geringere Gewinnchance mit höherem Gewinn"" (lower chance of winning with a higher win) to ""die Sicherheit des Gewinns an sich"" (the security of the win itself), suggesting they weigh the certainty of a gain against the potential for a higher gain with less certainty.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides on a ""geringere Gewinnchance mit höherem Gewinn"" (lower chance of winning with a higher win) over the certainty of a win, indicating they prefer the potential for a higher gain even if it's less certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considers the absence of losses and weighs the certainty of a gain against the potential for a higher, less certain gain. While the individual does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it, their focus on the trade-off between the certainty of a gain and the potential for a higher gain indirectly touches upon the idea of outcomes relative to a certain benchmark (in this case, the guaranteed win of 500 Euros, which coincidentally is the aspiration level).

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual prefers the option with a potential for a higher win, even if less certain, which can be seen as aligning with preferring outcomes that offer positive differences from a baseline (in this context, the guaranteed 500 Euros).

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process shares some conceptual similarities with the decision reason, particularly in weighing potential gains against certainty. However, the individual does not explicitly discuss probabilities of positive differences from an aspiration level, which is central to the decision reason. Thus, while there's some alignment in the preference for higher potential gains, the exact reasoning process described by the decision reason is not clearly mirrored in the verbal report.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, the outcome is -500 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-1000 + 0 - 500) / 3 = -500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, -1000 - (-500) = -500 and 0 - (-500) = 500; for Lottery B, -500 - (-500) = 0. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a 50% probability of a positive difference (500) and Lottery B has a 0% probability of a positive difference, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of winning or losing money in Lottery A and the certainty of losing money in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered the possibility of winning, whereas Lottery B only offered a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the possibility of winning or losing in each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with the individual’s choice of Lottery A because it offered a possibility of winning (a positive outcome relative to losing). However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention the concept of aspiration levels or the probability of positive differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly mention or imply the use of aspiration levels or the calculation of probabilities of positive differences as defined by the decision reason. While the choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring a lottery with a possibility of a positive outcome), the reasoning process described does not match the decision reason's specific criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner it is defined."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is calculated as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 4000 Euros, 2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The aspiration level can be calculated as (6000 + 0 + 4000 + 2000 + 0) / 5 = 2000 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, 6000 - 2000 = 4000 and 0 - 2000 = -2000; for Lottery A, 4000 - 2000 = 2000, 2000 - 2000 = 0, and 0 - 2000 = -2000. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher potential gain in Lottery B, the high probability of losing in Lottery B, the higher chance of winning in Lottery A, and the lower gain in Lottery A. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because it offers a higher chance of winning, despite the lower gain, which implies a preference for more security in gaining something.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considered the trade-off between the potential gain and the probability of winning in each lottery, which aligns with considering the outcomes and their associated probabilities but does not directly mention an aspiration level or calculating differences from it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification is based on preferring a higher chance of winning, even with a lower gain, which can be seen as related to preferring positive outcomes but does not explicitly mention the concept of an aspiration level or comparing differences from it.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's justification touches upon the idea of preferring outcomes that are more likely to be positive (or less likely to result in a loss), it does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason regarding the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from it. However, the focus on security and the chance of winning suggests some alignment with considering the probability of achieving positive outcomes, which is a component of the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30

This assessment indicates that while there are some elements in the individual's decision process that align with the general idea behind the decision reason (such as preferring a higher chance of a positive outcome), the specific application of an aspiration level and comparing probabilities of positive differences from this level is not clearly evident in the verbal report. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used in its precise form, but there are hints of related considerations."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: -6000 Euros, 0 Euros
- Lottery B: -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, 0 Euros
The aspiration level is calculated as: (-6000 + 0 - 4000 - 2000 + 0) / 5 = -2200 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For Lottery A: -6000 - (-2200) = -3800, 0 - (-2200) = 2200
- For Lottery B: -4000 - (-2200) = -1800, -2000 - (-2200) = 200, 0 - (-2200) = 2200
The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the probability of not incurring a loss and compares the losses between the two lotteries. They mention the higher probability of ""gewinnen"" (which translates to ""winning"" but in this context likely means not losing or getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by stating that the higher probability of not incurring a loss (75% chance of getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A provides more ""Sicherheit"" (safety or security).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual, however, focuses on the probability of not incurring a loss and the magnitude of losses.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the lottery based on the probability of avoiding a loss and the perceived safety.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they do not mention the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from such a level. Their focus is more on avoiding losses and the perceived safety of not losing, rather than the specific rule about aspiration levels and positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (5000 + 0 + 5) / 3 = 1683.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 5000 - 1683.33 = 3316.67 and 0 - 1683.33 = -1683.33; for Lottery B, 5 - 1683.33 = -1678.33. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Since Lottery A has a small probability (0.1%) of a positive difference and Lottery B has no chance of a positive difference (as its outcome is below the aspiration level with 100% probability), the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the larger gain, but emphasizes the importance of security in Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decides in favor of Lottery B due to its security, implying a preference for a certain outcome over a highly uncertain one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (aspiration level and differences from it) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning, security). The individual does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing outcomes to such a level, focusing instead on the probability of winning and the security of the outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring security). The individual’s justification does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule, as the individual does not discuss the aspiration level or the concept of positive differences from it.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of the aspiration level or comparisons to it, which are central to the decision reason. The focus on security and the low probability of winning in Lottery A does not align with the decision reason's specific criteria for evaluating lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (-5000 + 0 - 5) / 3 = -1666.67 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery B, -5000 - (-1666.67) = -3333.33 Euros and 0 - (-1666.67) = 1666.67 Euros; for Lottery A, -5 - (-1666.67) = 1661.67 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of a higher loss and the probability of losing in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chooses Lottery B because the probability of losing is lower.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating the aspiration level and considering the differences between outcomes and this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers the probability of losing, which is related to but not the same as the probability of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, whereas the individual chooses Lottery B because the probability of losing is lower, which can be interpreted as related to but not directly equivalent to the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not explicitly mention the aspiration level or the differences between outcomes and this level, and the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule. However, the individual's consideration of the probability of losing in Lottery B shows some indirect relation to the concept of positive differences, preventing a complete dismissal of the decision reason's influence."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros and -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 1500 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1500) / 3 = 1500 / 3 = 500 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are: for Lottery A, 3000 - 500 = 2500 and -3000 - 500 = -3500; for Lottery B, 1500 - 500 = 1000. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring a ""Sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) over the risk of a high loss. This implies the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the risk of loss in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification is based on avoiding a high loss and preferring a certain gain, indicating risk aversion.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's consideration of a safe gain versus a risky option does not directly mention aspiration levels or probabilities of positive differences but focuses on risk aversion and the desire for a certain outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual prefers the safe gain, which aligns with preferring positive (or less negative) outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing probabilities of being above an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on risk aversion and preference for a certain gain does not directly align with the specific calculations and considerations of the decision reason regarding aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. While there is a general alignment in preferring outcomes that are not negative, the explicit reasoning process described in the verbal report does not closely match the decision reason's rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual in the manner described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries:
- Lottery A: 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros
- Lottery B: 2000 Euros

The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 2000) / 3 = 2000 / 3 ≈ 666.67 Euros.
The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are:
- For 3000 Euros: 3000 - 666.67 ≈ 2333.33 Euros (positive difference)
- For -3000 Euros: -3000 - 666.67 ≈ -3666.67 Euros (negative difference)
- For 2000 Euros: 2000 - 666.67 ≈ 1333.33 Euros (positive difference)

The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. We can proceed to analyze the verbal report to see if this reasoning aligns with the individual's thought process.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions considering a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (safe gain) versus the risk of a ""hohen Verlust"" (high loss), indicating they are weighing the certainty of a positive outcome against the possibility of a significant negative outcome.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by preferring the safe gain (implied to be Lottery B, with a 100% chance of gaining 2000 Euros) over the risk of a high loss (implied to be Lottery A, with a 50% chance of losing 3000 Euros), despite acknowledging the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual considers the safety of a gain versus the risk of a significant loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of positive and negative differences but does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of being above this level.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. The individual prefers the safe gain, which implies a preference for a certain positive outcome over a gamble with both positive and negative outcomes. This preference for certainty can be seen as aligning with preferring positive differences (in this case, the certain gain of 2000 Euros) but does not directly reflect the decision reason's specific rule about probabilities of positive differences relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report indicates a preference for certainty and avoiding significant loss, which aligns somewhat with the concept of preferring positive outcomes. However, the report does not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing the probabilities of positive differences from this level, which are key components of the decision reason. Thus, while there's a slight alignment in the preference for positive outcomes, the specific decision reason provided does not seem to be directly applied in the individual's decision-making process as described."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the aspiration level, which is the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For the given lotteries, the outcomes are 3000 Euros, -3000 Euros, and 1000 Euros. The aspiration level is calculated as (3000 + (-3000) + 1000) / 3 = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 3000 - 333.33 = 2666.67, -3000 - 333.33 = -3333.33, and 1000 - 333.33 = 666.67. These differences are considered important. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the security of the gain in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, specifically mentioning a higher chance to lose than to win in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by preferring the security of the gain (in Lottery A) over the risk of loss (in Lottery B), indicating a preference for a certain gain over a gamble with potential loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the security of the gain and the risk of loss without explicit reference to an aspiration level or the probabilities of positive differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences, which aligns with preferring a secure gain (positive difference from an implicit aspiration of zero or a low reference point) but does not directly match the individual’s justification that emphasizes risk avoidance.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process, as described, does not explicitly align with the decision reason's focus on aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences. However, the preference for a secure gain could be seen as indirectly related to avoiding negative deviations from an aspiration level (in this case, perhaps an implicit aspiration level of not losing money). The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual used the specific decision reason involving aspiration levels and probabilities of positive differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the aspiration level, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the aspiration level as the mean of all outcomes in the decision problem while ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros. Thus, the aspiration level is (6000 + (-6000) + 0) / 3 = 0 Euros. The differences between the outcomes and the aspiration level are 6000 Euros for the positive outcome of Lottery A, -6000 Euros for the negative outcome of Lottery A, and 0 Euros for the outcome of Lottery B. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences. Given the aspiration level of 0 Euros, Lottery A offers a 50% chance of a positive difference (6000 Euros) and a 50% chance of a negative difference (-6000 Euros), while Lottery B offers a 0% chance of a positive difference and a 0% chance of a negative difference since its outcome is exactly at the aspiration level.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the absence of a chance to win in Lottery B and the 50% chance to win or lose in Lottery A. They also thought about the context of whether they already had a base capital to risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a chance to win, which was not present in Lottery B. They justified this choice by mentioning that without a previous win (or base capital), they preferred the risk of winning over the certainty of not winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason involves calculating an aspiration level and considering the probability of positive differences from this level. The individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention calculating an aspiration level or comparing probabilities of outcomes relative to such a level. Instead, they focus on the presence or absence of a chance to win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher probability of positive differences from the aspiration level. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the desire to have a chance to win, which can be seen as related to seeking positive outcomes but does not explicitly involve comparing probabilities of outcomes relative to an aspiration level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not explicitly align with the decision reason that considers the aspiration level and the probability of positive differences from this level. While the individual does consider the aspect of having a chance to win, which could be tangentially related to seeking positive outcomes, the core elements of the decision reason (aspiration level calculation, comparison of probabilities of positive differences) are not mentioned. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual used this specific decision reason to make their choice."
