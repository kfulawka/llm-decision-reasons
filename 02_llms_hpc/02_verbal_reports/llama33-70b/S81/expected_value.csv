STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV can be calculated as follows: (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01) = 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is simply 2400 Euros since it offers 2400 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 2409 Euros for Lottery A and 2400 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the possible gain difference between Option A and Option B and the risk of ending up with 0 Euros in Option A. This indicates the individual considered the potential outcomes and their probabilities, specifically the risk associated with the lower payout in Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that the potential gain difference was not high enough to risk ending up with nothing. This implies the individual weighed the potential benefits against the risks.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential gain difference and risk of the lowest payout). While the individual considered the risk and potential gain, there's no direct mention of calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (potential gain not worth the risk of getting nothing). The decision reason's rule is based on a quantitative comparison of expected values, whereas the individual's justification is more qualitative, focusing on the perceived risk and potential gain without explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not directly indicate that the individual calculated or compared the expected values of the two lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The individual's focus was more on the risk of the lowest payout and the perceived difference in potential gains rather than a quantitative comparison of expected values. Therefore, while the individual considered aspects related to the decision (outcomes and risks), the specific decision reason based on expected values does not seem to have been the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, where EV = (probability of winning * amount to win). For Lottery A, EV = 0.34 * 2400. For Lottery B, EV = 0.33 * 2500. Calculating these values: 
- EV of Lottery A = 0.34 * 2400 = 816 Euros
- EV of Lottery B = 0.33 * 2500 = 825 Euros
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case is Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential difference a 1% change in probability could make and the idea of going with the ""potentially higher winning chance,"" indicating they looked at the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the potential for a higher winning chance and the risk of ending up with 0 Euros, suggesting they considered the risk aspect and the chance of winning something versus nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability differences and risk of ending up with 0 Euros): The individual's considerations do not directly mention expected values but focus more on the probabilities and the risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (going with the potentially higher winning chance due to risk considerations): The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the expected values of the two lotteries but rather focuses on the perceived higher chance of winning and risk management.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason of comparing expected values to make their choice. Instead, they focused on the probabilities and the risk of ending up with nothing, which aligns more with a risk assessment rather than a straightforward expected value calculation.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as follows:
- For Lottery A: (4000 Euros * 0.8) + (0 Euros * 0.2) = 3200 Euros
- For Lottery B: (3000 Euros * 1.0) = 3000 Euros
The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. The expected value of Lottery A is 3200 Euros, and the expected value of Lottery B is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the difference in potential winnings (Gewinnmarge), the risk of getting 0 Euros with a 20% probability, and the preference for a secure, albeit slightly lower, gain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by stating that the difference in potential winnings was not high enough to risk getting nothing, and the 20% probability of getting nothing was significant, leading them to prefer a secure, slightly lower gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the expected values of the lotteries, which are 3200 Euros for Lottery A and 3000 Euros for Lottery B. However, the individual's considerations, as expressed in the verbal report, do not explicitly mention expected values or calculations. Instead, they discuss the risk of getting nothing and the preference for a secure gain.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing a preference for a secure gain over the risk of getting nothing, even if it means a potentially lower reward. This suggests that the individual's decision was influenced more by risk aversion and the desire for certainty rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report indicates that their decision was based on risk aversion and the desire for a secure gain, rather than a comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries. Since the decision reason specifically considers the expected value of each lottery, and the individual's justification does not align with this reasoning, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Ich dachte, dass die 5% kein besonders großer Unterschied sind, und ich gerne die höhere Summe hätte, auch weil das schlimmste was hätte passieren können, neutral gewesen wäre.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which is based on the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = 800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 750 Euros for Lottery A and 800 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the difference in probabilities (""5%"") and the preference for the higher sum, indicating they considered the outcomes and possibly the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by mentioning the relatively small difference in probabilities (""5%"") and the desire for the higher sum, with the worst outcome being neutral (0 Euros).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the comparison of expected values, which is based on both outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered the outcomes and mentioned a difference in probabilities, but did not explicitly calculate or compare expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the preference for the higher sum and the relatively small difference in probabilities, without explicitly stating a comparison of overall expected values.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did consider aspects relevant to calculating expected value (outcomes and probabilities) but did not explicitly follow the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value as stated in the decision reason. The mention of the ""5% difference"" and the desire for the ""höhere Summe"" (higher sum) suggests an intuitive consideration of the trade-offs but does not directly align with the systematic calculation and comparison of expected values as the decision reason dictates.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered elements that are part of the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), they did not explicitly apply the rule of choosing based on the higher expected value, indicating a low likelihood that the decision reason was used as defined."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, where EV = (outcome * probability). For Lottery A, EV = (3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the potential winnings (Gewinnsumme) between the two lotteries and found it significant. They also considered the probability of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B to be high at 45%. Additionally, they mentioned being comfortable with the risk of winning 0 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to focus on the attractiveness of the higher potential win in Lottery B and their comfort with the associated risk, rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves both the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered the outcomes and probabilities but did not explicitly mention calculating expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing expected values but focuses on the perceived high probability of the larger win and comfort with risk.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the expected value calculation as their decision reason. They considered components that are part of the expected value calculation (outcomes and probabilities) but did not explicitly apply the rule of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value as their justification.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered elements relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities), they did not explicitly apply the rule of choosing based on the higher expected value, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for their choice."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and it shows that both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probability of winning in both lotteries but focused on the preference for the higher sum if they were to win.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the preference for having the higher sum if they were to win, given that both outcomes are considered extremely unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on the expected value, which was not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focused on the preference for the higher sum due to the low probabilities.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, is based on preferring the higher sum, which aligns with a different rationale than the expected value calculation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process but rather a preference for the higher potential gain due to the perceived low probabilities of winning. This rationale does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, especially since both lotteries have the same expected value, leading to the conclusion that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is EV_B = -3000 * 1 = -3000 Euros. Since EV_B > EV_A, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of the loss in Lottery B and its comparison to the potential loss in Lottery A, the risk associated with Lottery A, and the maximum outcome of Lottery A (0 Euros) and its probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers Lottery B because the loss, although certain, is smaller, and they do not want to take the risk associated with Lottery A, given the potential maximum outcome of 0 Euros is very unlikely.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of loss, risk, and maximum outcomes), we see that the individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring the smaller certain loss over taking a risk for a potentially similar or worse outcome), it appears the individual's decision is based more on risk aversion and the certainty of outcomes rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's reasoning process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason of comparing expected values to make a choice. The focus on risk aversion and the preference for a certain, though smaller, loss over a riskier option with potentially worse outcomes suggests that while the outcome of the decision (choosing Lottery B) aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the underlying reasoning process described does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as: EV_A = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is: EV_B = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the given outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions considering the principle of the difference in probabilities (""die 5% machen kaum einen Unterschied"") and the preference for losing less money if they are likely to lose (""dass ich dann lieber etwas weniger Geld verlieren würde, wenn ich schon so wahrscheinlich verlieren werde""). 
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies their choice based on the minimal difference in probabilities and the preference for a smaller loss, indicating they focused on the loss amount and its probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (difference in probabilities and preference for smaller loss), we see that the individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. 
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the minimal difference in probabilities and preferring a smaller loss), it appears the individual's reasoning is more aligned with minimizing loss rather than maximizing expected value. The decision reason specifically looks at the overall expected value, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values in their decision-making process, instead focusing on the difference in loss amounts and the probabilities of those losses, which suggests they did not use the decision reason based on expected value to make their decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, and in this case, both lotteries have the same expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing a larger amount at once (6000 Euros) versus a smaller but very probable loss (3000 Euros), indicating a focus on the magnitude of potential losses and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the ""lesser evil,"" implying they chose the option they perceived as less harmful or risky, which in their view was the loss of 3000 Euros with high probability over the loss of 6000 Euros with lower probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, but the individual's considerations were more aligned with risk aversion and the perceived magnitude of losses rather than calculating or comparing expected values directly.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. The individual, however, was not indifferent and chose based on a different criterion (the ""lesser evil"" in terms of risk perception).

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason based on expected values to make their decision. Instead, their choice was influenced by risk perception and the desire to avoid a larger potential loss, even though the expected values of the two lotteries are equal.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6. For Lottery B, EV = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would be indifferent between them. The relevant information for this reason is the outcomes and their probabilities, which are provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the perception of low loss probabilities for both lotteries and a difficulty in assessing the difference that 0.01% makes. Second, the individual's justification for the choice seems to be based on a feeling of safety with Lottery B, due to its higher probability of not losing (99.99% vs. 99.8%), rather than a direct comparison of expected values or a systematic evaluation of the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities for calculating expected value) with that considered by the individual (perceived low loss probabilities and the feeling of safety), there's a mismatch. The individual does not mention calculating or comparing expected values. Second, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value or being indifferent if they are equal) does not align with the individual's justification (feeling of safety due to higher non-loss probability). The individual's choice seems to be influenced by the perceived risk rather than the calculated expected value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is 500 Euros * 100% = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the lotteries. Both lotteries have the same expected value of 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual, it appears the individual is focusing on the potential gain and the risk of not trying for a higher reward. They seem to value the possibility of winning more (up to doubling the amount) and are willing to take the risk of ending up with the same amount (or potentially less, but in this case, the ""less"" is still the same as the guaranteed amount in Lottery A) rather than taking a guaranteed but lower amount without trying for more.
Second, the individual’s justification for their choice seems to be based on the desire to attempt to achieve a higher gain and the satisfaction of trying, rather than just accepting a guaranteed but potentially lower outcome without taking the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential for higher gain, risk, and personal satisfaction from trying), it seems the individual is not directly considering the expected values as calculated. The individual's focus is more on the potential upside and the psychological aspect of trying for more rather than the mathematical expectation.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring to try for a higher gain and the satisfaction thereof), the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the expected values of the two lotteries or choosing based on which one has a higher expected value. Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would lead to indifference, but the individual's justification does not align with this reasoning.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report suggests that their decision was influenced by factors other than the expected value of the lotteries, such as the desire for a potential higher gain and the psychological satisfaction of trying for more. The decision reason, which is based solely on the expected value, does not seem to align with the individual's justification for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is -500 Euros with 100% probability. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of -500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual seems to consider the certainty of the outcome in one option and the probability of losing in the other, mentioning a ""50% Wahrscheinlichkeit, gleich die Hälfte von den 2000 wieder zu verlieren"" which seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual lottery outcomes. They also mention that neither option promises a gain.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by expressing dissatisfaction with the 50% probability of losing (though the amount mentioned, ""die Hälfte von den 2000"", does not directly relate to the actual lotteries described) and appreciates the certainty of the outcome in the other option, despite no gain being possible.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual seems more focused on the certainty of outcomes and the dissatisfaction with the probability of loss rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or preferring one lottery over the other based on this criterion. Instead, the focus is on the certainty and the dissatisfaction with the probabilistic nature of one of the options.

Based on these comparisons, it seems that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, as there's no clear indication that expected values were calculated or compared. The individual's decision seems to be influenced more by the certainty of the outcome and the aversion to the probabilistic loss.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning something (50% chance of winning with Lottery B) and the aspect of not getting anything (risking to get nothing).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred having a greater chance of winning something over risking getting nothing, even if the other win might be higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning something and avoiding getting nothing): The individual's considerations do not directly mention or imply calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring a greater chance of winning something): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule of maximizing expected value. The individual focuses on the chance of winning something rather than the overall expected monetary gain.

To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery, we follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing in each lottery, specifically mentioning that it seemed less probable to lose something with Lottery A and expressing discomfort with the 50% loss probability in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the feeling of loss aversion, specifically hoping not to lose anything with Lottery A due to its perceived lower likelihood of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on expected values, but the individual's consideration was focused on the perception of loss probabilities rather than calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. The individual, however, made a choice based on perceived probabilities of loss and a desire to avoid loss, not on the basis of expected value comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The focus on loss probabilities and the desire to avoid loss, rather than a comparison of expected values, indicates that the decision reason was not used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, we will follow the given steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV_A = (5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, with a 100% chance of winning 5 Euros, the expected value is simply 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the preference for a ""sicheren Gewinn"" (a sure win) and compares having a bird in the hand (a sure thing) to one on the roof (something less certain). This indicates the individual values certainty.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by expressing a preference for the certainty of a win over the uncertainty of a potentially larger win, even if the certain win is much smaller. The phrase ""lieber den Spatz in der Hand als die Taube auf dem Dach"" (better a bird in the hand than one on the roof) is a German idiom that reflects a preference for a smaller but certain advantage over a potentially greater one that is less certain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is the same for both lotteries. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of the win, not explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual, however, prefers Lottery B for its certainty, not because of its expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus on the certainty of the outcome rather than the expected value indicates that the decision reason based on expected value was not used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (-5000 Euros * 0.1%) + (0 Euros * 99.9%) = -5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss of Lottery A and the low probability of a high loss in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the reluctance to accept a certain loss (in Lottery A) and viewing the risk of a high loss in Lottery B as relatively low, which led them to take the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focused on the certainty of loss in one option and the low probability of a significant loss in the other.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. However, the individual's justification is based on the acceptance of risk due to the low probability of a significant loss and the reluctance to accept a certain loss, not explicitly on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's reasoning, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the loss and the perceived risk, rather than on calculating and comparing expected values. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected values was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The EV of Lottery A is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. The EV of Lottery B is 1500 Euros * 1 = 1500 Euros. Since Lottery B has a higher expected value than Lottery A, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B. The relevant information for this reason is the monetary outcomes and their probabilities, which are provided.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in Lottery B, the 50% probability of losing double what could be won in Lottery B if they chose Lottery A, and the preference for collecting small, safe amounts over risking what they might have won.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by finding the option of a sure gain too enticing and being deterred by the high risk of losing more than they could gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (certainty of gain, risk of loss, preference for small safe amounts), we see that while the individual does consider aspects related to risk and gain, they do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the certainty of gain and aversion to high risk), it appears that the individual's decision is more influenced by risk aversion and the appeal of a certain gain rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with the decision reason's outcome (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries. The reasoning provided in the report focuses more on risk aversion and the appeal of a certain gain, suggesting that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is 2000 Euros * 1 = 2000 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential loss in Lottery A as too high and the probability of this loss as significant. They also considered 2000 Euros as a good gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the high potential loss and its probability in Lottery A and the attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (potential loss, probability of loss, attractiveness of the certain gain in Lottery B): The individual's considerations do not directly mention the calculation or comparison of expected values but focus on the downside risk of Lottery A and the guaranteed upside of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification implies a preference for avoiding a potential significant loss and gaining a certain amount, which indirectly aligns with preferring a lottery with a positive expected value (Lottery B) over one with a zero expected value (Lottery A) but does not explicitly mention expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 30
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries but focuses on the risk and reward aspects that indirectly relate to the concept of expected value. The emphasis on avoiding loss and appreciating the certain gain in Lottery B suggests some alignment with the principle of preferring higher expected values, but the lack of explicit mention of expected values or their calculation in the decision-making process leads to uncertainty about whether the decision reason was directly applied. Thus, the assessment is below the midpoint, indicating that while there's some alignment, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used as defined."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (3000 Euros * 0.5) + (-3000 Euros * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 1000 Euros * 1 = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from their outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the principle of ""a bird in the hand"" (Spatzen in der Hand), indicating a preference for a certain gain over a risky option. They also found the potential gain in Lottery A attractive but were deterred by the risk of a significant loss with high probability.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification seems to focus on the risk aversion, specifically the reluctance to risk a high loss for a potential gain, suggesting the individual prioritized the certainty of a gain (Lottery B) over the gamble (Lottery A).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (risk of loss, attractiveness of gain, certainty of outcome), we see the individual considered aspects related to but not explicitly the expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (prioritizing certainty and avoiding risk), while the individual’s justification does lead to choosing Lottery B (which has a higher expected value), it does so based on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of expected values.
Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason of comparing expected values to make their decision but arrived at a choice that aligns with the decision reason due to other considerations (risk aversion).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the verbal report indicates the decision was made based on risk aversion and the appeal of a certain gain rather than a direct calculation or consideration of the expected values of the lotteries."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows: EV = (0.5 * 6000) + (0.5 * -6000) = 3000 - 3000 = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is 0 Euros with 100% probability, so EV = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have an expected value of 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of losing a high sum of money with 50% probability.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that losing a high sum of money with 50% probability is too risky and prefers to stay with the current sum (implied to be 0 Euros, as that is the outcome of Lottery A).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (risk of losing a high sum of money): The individual does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values but focuses on the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (avoiding risk): Since both lotteries have the same expected value (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent between them. However, the individual’s justification is based on risk aversion rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's focus on risk and the desire to avoid potential loss indicates a different rationale for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason based on expected values was not used by the individual."
