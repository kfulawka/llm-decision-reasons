STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
First, we need to derive the information relevant to the decision reason from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros with probabilities 33%, 66%, and 1%, respectively. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. The decision reason categorizes an outcome as probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Thus, the probable outcomes for Lottery B are 2400 Euros (with 66% probability) since it exceeds the threshold, and for Lottery A, the outcome 2400 Euros is considered probable as it has a 100% probability. Now, we calculate the average of the probable outcomes for each lottery. For Lottery B, the average is (2400 Euros), and for Lottery A, it is (2400 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the low probability of winning nothing in Lottery B as a factor in their decision, indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided in favor of Lottery B because the probability of winning nothing is so low, suggesting that the individual's decision was influenced by the perceived risk or the guarantee of not losing in Lottery B compared to the certainty of a win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case would be the average of outcomes with probabilities higher than 33.33%. The individual, however, seems to focus on the low probability of winning nothing, which indirectly relates to the consideration of probabilities but does not explicitly discuss averaging probable outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification, however, is based on the low risk of not winning anything, which does not directly align with calculating an average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the low probability of not winning anything in Lottery B and the decision to choose Lottery B based on this consideration does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. While the individual does consider probabilities, the method of averaging probable outcomes to make a decision is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the verbal report, suggesting that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 2500 Euros has a probability of 33%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 67%, which is higher than 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 2400 Euros has a probability of 34%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 66%, which is higher than 50%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, only the 0 Euro outcomes are probable for both lotteries, as they are the only outcomes with probabilities greater than 50%. The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries would be 0 Euros, since the only probable outcome for each is 0 Euros. However, the reason seems to imply a comparison based on the presence of probable outcomes and their values, but given the specific probabilities, only the 0 Euro outcomes qualify as probable. This simplifies the comparison to the non-probable outcomes since both lotteries' probable outcomes (0 Euros) are the same.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and gains of both lotteries and noted their similarities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery with the slightly higher gain despite a minimally smaller chance of winning. This suggests the individual prioritized the potential gain over the slight difference in probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, but given the specifics of the lotteries, this leads to a comparison of the non-probable outcomes (2500 Euros vs. 2400 Euros) since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual considered the similarities in probabilities and gains, which aligns with looking at the overall structure of the lotteries but does not directly indicate a focus on probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would suggest choosing the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, but since the probable outcomes are the same (0 Euros), the decision reason's direct application is not clearly aligned with the individual's justification, which prioritizes the higher gain despite slightly lower probability. However, the individual's choice can be seen as indirectly related to the decision reason if we consider the implication that the individual valued the higher potential gain, which could be interpreted as considering the impact of the non-probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report suggests a focus on the similarities between the lotteries and a preference for the higher gain, which does not directly align with the decision reason's specific criteria for probable outcomes and their averages. While there is a superficial alignment in considering the outcomes, the decision reason's specific application to probable outcomes (which are both 0 Euros in this case) does not directly influence the individual's stated justification for choosing the lottery with the higher gain. Thus, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the outcome is always probable since 100% is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery A has two outcomes: 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. Only the 4000 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
- Lottery B has one outcome: 3000 Euros with 100% probability, which is probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (4000 Euros * 80%) / 100% = 3200 Euros, considering only the probable outcome. For Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected value for both lotteries and was initially inclined towards Lottery A. This suggests they considered the monetary outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery B after considering the risk-free alternative, indicating a focus on avoiding risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which requires identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than a certain threshold and calculating their average. The individual considered expected values, which involves a similar calculation but does not necessarily focus on the ""probable"" aspect as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, while the individual chose based on the risk-free nature of Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the comparison of averages of probable outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process involved calculating expected values and considering risk, which does not directly align with the decision reason's specific focus on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that it is unlikely the decision reason was used by the individual, as their deliberation process, as described, focused on expected values and risk aversion rather than the specific rule outlined in the decision reason."
4,"ausgehen, dass bei einer Wahrscheinlichkeit zu Gewinnen im Verhältnis zum Gewinn Rechnung Lotterie A besser wegkommt. Das war für mich der wichtige Punkt um meine Entscheidung zu treffen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 4000 Euros has a probability of 20%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 80%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 25%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 75%, which is higher than 50%. Therefore, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery B.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is also 0 Euros. However, the decision reason's application in this step seems to lead to a tie since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), but the reason specifically prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Given the lotteries' structures, the decision reason as stated does not directly apply in a meaningful way because it does not differentiate between the two lotteries based on their probable outcomes. Nonetheless, we can proceed to understand how the individual made their decision.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the difference in winning probabilities between the two lotteries (5% difference) and the expected value (Erwartungswert) of each lottery. They mention that the expected value of Lottery A is higher than that of Lottery B, which was a crucial point for their decision.
Second, the individual's justification for their choice seems to hinge on the comparison of the expected values of the two lotteries rather than the probabilities alone. They imply that despite the lower winning probability, the potential gain from Lottery A makes it more attractive, especially when considering the statistical expectation.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (difference in probabilities and expected values), it appears there is a mismatch. The individual focused more on the expected values and the potential gains rather than the concept of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (focusing on expected values and potential gains), it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as defined. The decision reason, as interpreted, does not directly lead to a preference for one lottery over the other based on the given probabilities, since both lotteries have a probable outcome of 0 Euros. However, the individual's decision-making process was influenced by a related concept (expected value), which suggests an understanding of the lotteries' potential outcomes but not an application of the specific decision reason provided.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. So, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 45%, which is less than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 55%, which is higher than 50%. For Lottery B, the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 90%, which is higher than 50%, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 10%, which is less than 50%. Thus, for Lottery A, only the 0 Euro outcome is considered probable, and for Lottery B, only the 3000 Euro outcome is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is 3000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The individual mentions the high probability (90%) of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery B and expresses a reluctance to take the higher risk of winning nothing in Lottery A. This indicates that the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes, particularly focusing on the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B. The justification for the choice seems to be based on the perceived risk and the attractiveness of the high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (high probability of a positive outcome in Lottery B and the risk of winning nothing in Lottery A), it appears that the individual did consider the aspect of probability, which is a key component of the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, that would be Lottery B, since its average of probable outcomes (3000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B aligns with preferring a higher probability of a positive outcome, which indirectly supports the decision reason's rule, as the reason would also prefer Lottery B due to its higher average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high degree of certainty that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification and the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. However, it is not a perfect match since the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating averages of probable outcomes, hence not a 100% certainty."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Thus, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5, and the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is lower than 0.5. For Lottery B, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5, and the outcome of 3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is lower than 0.5. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euro outcomes are probable, their average is 0 for both lotteries. However, the decision reason's applicability hinges on identifying probable outcomes and comparing their averages, which, in this context, does not differentiate between the lotteries based on the given probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries and the difference in these probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%). They also considered the potential winnings and the fact that both winning scenarios are highly unrealistic.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the difference in probabilities (0.1% to 0.2%) was not significant enough to outweigh the potential for a higher win (6000 Euros vs. 3000 Euros), especially considering that both winning scenarios are highly unrealistic.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes (those with a probability > 0.5) and their averages. However, the individual's consideration was on the low probabilities of the winning outcomes and the potential winnings, not on averaging probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes does not align with the individual's justification, which was based on the comparison of winning probabilities and potential winnings, not on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes and their averages. The individual's consideration of the low probabilities of winning and the potential winnings, along with the perceived unlikeliness of both winning scenarios, indicates a different rationale for their choice. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery B, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Thus, the -4000 Euros outcome with 80% probability is considered probable. For Lottery A, there is only one outcome, so it is considered probable by default. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values: for Lottery B, -4000 Euros, and for Lottery A, -3000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the information considered by the individual includes the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the high probability of not winning (or losing) in Lottery B. The individual compares the outcomes and focuses on the absence of risk in Lottery A.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice emphasizes the security of the gain in Lottery A and the lack of sufficient incentives in Lottery B to take on the risk of getting nothing. The deliberation process described centers around risk aversion and the certainty of outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes and their averages) with that considered by the individual (certainty of outcome in A, high probability of loss in B), there is a partial overlap. The individual does consider the probabilities and outcomes but focuses more on the risk aspect rather than calculating an average of probable outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring the certain outcome due to risk aversion), there is a conceptual alignment in preferring a more secure option (Lottery A) over one with significant risk (Lottery B), but the individual does not explicitly calculate or compare averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, aligns with preferring a secure outcome over a risky one, which indirectly relates to the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes. However, the explicit calculation and comparison of averages of probable outcomes, as required by the decision reason, are not mentioned in the verbal report. Thus, while there's a conceptual alignment, the specific application of the decision reason as defined is not clearly evident in the individual's deliberation process."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step approach provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (80%) is higher than 50%.
For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable because its probability (75%) is higher than 50%.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A is also 0 Euros. 
Thus, the decision reason can be applied but leads to indifference between the two lotteries based on the given probabilities and outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual calculated the expected value for both lotteries and considered this as the basis for their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it had a higher expected value, implying that over many plays, one would receive more money from Lottery B compared to Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, whereas the individual considered the expected value of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would lead to indifference in this case (since both lotteries have an average probable outcome of 0 Euros), whereas the individual preferred Lottery B due to its higher expected value.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described, since their decision was based on expected value rather than the average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. 
- For Lottery B, the outcomes are -6000 Euros with 45% probability and 0 Euros with 55% probability. Only the 0 Euros outcome is probable since 55% > 50%.
- For Lottery A, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 90% probability and 0 Euros with 10% probability. Only the -3000 Euros outcome is probable since 90% > 50%.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. 
For Lottery B, the average of probable outcomes is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable).
For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is -3000 Euros (since only the -3000 Euros outcome is probable).
Thus, the decision reason can be applied, and the relevant information is the average of probable outcomes for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially focused on the high loss in Lottery B but then considered the likelihood of avoiding a financial loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the option where the loss is most likely to be avoided, implying a consideration of the probability of avoiding a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which involves identifying outcomes with probabilities greater than 50% and calculating their average. The individual considered the likelihood of avoiding a financial loss, which aligns with identifying the probable outcomes (in this case, the 0 Euros outcome in Lottery B and the -3000 Euros outcome in Lottery A).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. The individual's justification, while not explicitly calculating averages, suggests a preference for the option where the financial loss is most likely avoided, which could imply preferring the lottery with a ""better"" probable outcome, in this case, avoiding loss (0 Euros) being preferable to a certain loss (-3000 Euros), even if the reasoning is not explicitly about averages.
Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process aligns with considering the probability of outcomes and their preference, but the explicit calculation or consideration of the ""average of probable outcomes"" as defined by the decision reason is not clearly stated in the verbal report.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the probability of avoiding a loss, which is somewhat aligned with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes, the explicit application of the decision reason's rule (calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes) is not clearly evident in the verbal report. The individual's reasoning seems to prioritize avoiding loss, which could be seen as related to but not directly applying the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For both lotteries, there are 2 outcomes. Therefore, an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 0.5 (1/2). 
For Lottery B, the outcome of -6000 Euros has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.9%, which is higher than 0.5. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of -3000 Euros has a probability of 0.2%, which is less than 0.5, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 99.8%, which is higher than 0.5.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since only the 0 Euro outcomes are probable in both lotteries, the average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros. However, the decision reason's rule implies a comparison based on the existence of probable outcomes and their values, but since both lotteries have the same type of probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to consider how the individual applied this rule in the context of the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of winning and the amounts to be won in both lotteries, noting that the probabilities of winning are very low in both cases.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because, given the low probabilities of winning in both lotteries, they prioritized the lottery with the higher potential win, reasoning that if they were to be lucky enough to win, they might as well choose the lottery with the higher payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on probable outcomes and their averages, but in this case, both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). The individual, however, considered the low probabilities and the amounts to be won, which indirectly relates to the concept of probable outcomes but focuses more on the potential gains given the low probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes does not directly apply since both lotteries have the same probable outcome (0 Euros). However, the individual's justification for choosing the lottery with the higher potential win, given the low probabilities, does not align with the decision reason's specific rule about averages of probable outcomes. Instead, the individual seems to prioritize the potential gain in a more general sense, considering the low probability of winning in both cases.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of outcomes. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so any outcome is probable since 100% is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery B has one probable outcome: 1000 Euros with 50% probability and another outcome of 0 Euros with 50% probability. However, since both probabilities are exactly 50%, and the rule specifies higher than 1/2 for an outcome to be considered probable in a two-outcome scenario, technically, neither outcome is probable by the strict definition given. But for practical application in this context, considering the spirit of the decision reason, we might interpret it as considering outcomes with probabilities that meet or exceed this threshold as relevant, especially since it's a binary choice and the decision reason's intent seems to prioritize higher probability outcomes. Thus, both outcomes could be considered in the context of choosing between lotteries.
- Lottery A has one outcome: 500 Euros with 100% probability, which is clearly probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B, if considering both outcomes due to their equal probability and the context of the decision, would be (1000 + 0)/2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery A, it's 500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the gain in one of the options (Variante A) as a significant factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred the option with the certain gain (Variante A) over the option with uncertain outcomes (Variante B), indicating a preference for security over potential higher reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which, in the case of Lottery B, involves considering both the 1000 Euros and 0 Euros outcomes due to their probabilities. The individual, however, focuses on the certainty of gain, which aligns with preferring the higher average probable outcome in Lottery A but doesn't explicitly discuss averaging outcomes in Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes, which would be a tie in the calculated averages (500 Euros for both), but the individual's justification is based on the preference for a certain gain, not explicitly on calculating averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, focuses on the certainty of the gain rather than explicitly calculating and comparing the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. While the outcome of the decision aligns with what the decision reason might suggest (given the calculated averages are equal but the individual prefers the certain gain), the process described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason's rule regarding probable outcomes and their averages. Therefore, it's unlikely that the decision reason was directly used by the individual in making the decision."
12,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is considered probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes in Lottery A have a 50% probability, making them both probable. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome, so its probability of 100% makes it probable by default. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the average of these probable outcomes. For Lottery A, the average is (-1000 + 0) / 2 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the average is -500 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual compared the possible outcomes of both lotteries, noting the risk of not winning in Lottery A and the certainty of losing 500 Euros in Lottery B. They also considered the probabilities and the potential for repetition, suggesting that the expected outcome over time might be similar but with Lottery A carrying the risk of winning nothing.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the loss is certain and, when comparing the 50% chance of winning 1000 Euros in Lottery A to the 100% chance of losing 500 Euros in Lottery B, they felt that the risk of possibly winning nothing in Lottery A was not worth taking, especially considering potential repetitions.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which for both lotteries is -500 Euros. The individual considered the risk, certainty, and potential outcomes over repetitions but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. Since both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (-500 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent. However, the individual chose Lottery B because of the certainty of the outcome, not explicitly because of the average probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery A, rather than explicitly comparing the average probable outcomes as the decision reason suggests. While the individual does consider aspects of the lotteries that are relevant to the decision reason (like the outcomes and their probabilities), the final choice is justified on different grounds (certainty vs. risk). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's decision, but there is some overlap in the considerations, which is why the assessment is not a complete zero."

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 ≈ 0.33. 
For Lottery A, the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 0.75, which is higher than 0.5, and the outcome of 6000 Euros has a probability of 0.25, which is lower than 0.5. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
For Lottery B, the outcomes of 4000 Euros and 2000 Euros each have a probability of 0.25, which is lower than 0.33, and the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability of 0.5, which is higher than 0.33. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros, and for Lottery B is also 0 Euros. However, since the decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes and both lotteries have the same average probable outcome (0 Euros), we need to examine how the individual's thought process aligns with this reasoning in the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the possible gains, then the respective probabilities, and then the probability of winning nothing. After calculating the expected value for both lotteries, they compared again the probability of winning nothing and decided on Lottery B because winning something was more important to them than possibly winning nothing, even if it meant accepting a lower gain.
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the importance of winning something over the risk of winning nothing, which led them to prefer Lottery B despite its potentially lower gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probable outcomes based on the given probabilities and their averages) with that considered by the individual (possible gains, probabilities, expected values, and the importance of winning something), it appears the individual considered more factors than just the probable outcomes and their averages.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes) to the individual's justification (preferring to win something over the risk of winning nothing, even with a potentially lower gain), the individual's reasoning seems to align more closely with risk aversion or a desire to avoid the outcome of winning nothing rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule about averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, although the individual considered probabilities and outcomes, their justification for choosing Lottery B was based more on the desire to avoid winning nothing and accepting a lower but more secure gain, rather than strictly following the decision reason's rule about the average of probable outcomes. The decision reason's specific criteria (average of probable outcomes) do not directly align with the individual's stated reasoning (importance of winning something, comparison of expected values, and risk aversion), indicating that the decision reason was likely not the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 3 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. For Lottery B, there are also 3 outcomes, so the same probability threshold applies. 
- For Lottery A, the -6000 Euros outcome has a 25% probability, which is less than the threshold, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 75% probability, which is higher than the threshold. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros.
- For Lottery B, the -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros outcomes each have a 25% probability, which is less than the threshold, and the 0 Euros outcome has a 50% probability, which is also higher than the threshold. Thus, the probable outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros.
The average of probable outcomes for both lotteries is 0 Euros since only the 0 Euros outcome meets the probability threshold for being considered probable in both cases.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of money that could be lost in each lottery, focusing on minimizing the loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose the lottery where they would lose the least amount of money in case of a loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which in this case is 0 Euros for both lotteries, implying indifference based on the reason. However, the individual focused on minimizing the loss in case of a loss, which is different from considering the average of probable outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but since both lotteries have the same average of probable outcomes (0 Euros), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, made a choice based on minimizing potential loss, not on the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on minimizing loss and the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes are fundamentally different. The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries due to both having the same probable outcome of 0 Euros, whereas the individual's justification for the choice is based on a different criterion (minimizing loss). Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1, which is not applicable since no outcome can exceed 100% probability. For Lottery B, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. In Lottery B, the 0 Euros outcome with 99.9% probability is considered probable, and the 5000 Euros outcome with 0.1% probability is not. For Lottery A, the 5 Euros outcome with 100% probability is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 5 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 0 Euros because only the 0 Euros outcome is probable. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high risk of winning nothing in Lottery B and the certain gain in Lottery A. They also calculated the expected value of both lotteries and found them to be equal.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery A by the desire for a certain gain over the high risk of winning nothing in Lottery B, and after finding the expected values to be equal, they definitively chose Lottery A for its certainty.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual considered the risk and the certainty of outcomes but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the average of probable outcomes based on the specific probability threshold given by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual preferred Lottery A for its certainty and after considering expected values, not explicitly for having a higher average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's final choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific criteria of the decision reason (focusing on the average of probable outcomes based on the given probability threshold). The individual's consideration of certainty and expected values leads to a similar conclusion but through a different or not fully aligned rationale.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as the verbal report does not directly indicate the application of the specific rule regarding probable outcomes and their averages as defined by the decision reason. However, it is not a 0 because the individual's choice and some aspects of their reasoning (considering the certainty of outcomes) could tangentially relate to the decision reason's preference for Lottery A, albeit through a different logic path."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always probable since its probability (1) is higher than 1/1 = 1 is not applicable as the condition is always met for any outcome with a probability of 1. 
For Lottery A, the -5000 Euros outcome has a probability of 0.1%, which is less than 0.5, and the 0 Euros outcome has a probability of 99.9%, which is greater than 0.5. Thus, only the 0 Euros outcome is considered probable for Lottery A.
For Lottery B, the -5 Euros outcome is the only outcome and has a probability of 100%, making it a probable outcome.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euros outcome is probable), and for Lottery B, it is -5 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the potential winnings/losses of both lotteries, noting the low probability of winning 5000 Euros in Lottery A and comparing the expected outcomes of both lotteries over a high number of repetitions.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the high probability of winning nothing (or more accurately, getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A, combined with the low probability of the significant win, made the risk not worth it. They also mention that estimating the expected outcome over many repetitions resulted in a similar expected loss for both lotteries but preferred Lottery B for its lack of risk in a single trial.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which requires identifying outcomes with probabilities higher than 1 divided by the number of outcomes. The individual considered probabilities and outcomes but focused more on the risk and expected value over many trials rather than explicitly calculating the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher average of probable outcomes. In this case, Lottery A has an average of 0 Euros (since only the 0 Euro outcome is probable), and Lottery B has an average of -5 Euros, making Lottery A preferred by the decision reason. However, the individual chose Lottery B, citing risk aversion and similar expected outcomes over many trials, not explicitly the average of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the average of probable outcomes, which would have led to a preference for Lottery A due to its average of 0 Euros being higher than Lottery B's average of -5 Euros. However, the individual chose Lottery B based on risk considerations and the expected value over many trials, not the specific criterion of the average of probable outcomes. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

For Lottery A, there is 1 outcome, so the single outcome is always probable since its probability is 100%, which is higher than 1/1 or 100%. 
- Lottery B has two outcomes: 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. Both outcomes are probable since their probabilities are exactly 50%, which meets the criteria for being probable in a two-outcome scenario.
- Lottery A has one outcome: 1500 Euros with 100% probability, which is also probable.
The average of probable outcomes for Lottery B is (3000 + (-3000)) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the possibility of losing money in Lottery B and the certainty of winning in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offers a certain gain, as opposed to Lottery B, which carries the risk of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires considering the average of probable outcomes, which involves calculating or comparing the outcomes based on their probabilities. The individual focused on the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk of loss in Lottery B, not explicitly mentioning the calculation of averages or comparison of probable outcomes based on the decision reason's criteria.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, which would lead to preferring Lottery A (average of 1500 Euros) over Lottery B (average of 0 Euros). The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the certainty of the gain and the avoidance of potential loss, not explicitly on the comparison of averages of probable outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), but the verbal report does not indicate that the decision was made based on the specific rule of comparing the averages of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason. The focus was more on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A versus the risk in Lottery B, rather than the calculated average of probable outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are two outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a 50% probability, making them both probable. For Lottery B, there is only one outcome, which is 100% probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their average. For Lottery A, the average of probable outcomes is (3000 Euros - 3000 Euros) / 2 = 0 Euros, since both outcomes are considered. For Lottery B, the average (and the only outcome) is 2000 Euros. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A versus the certain gain of 2000 Euros in Lottery B. They also looked at the potential gain of Lottery A and compared it to the certain gain of Lottery B, mentioning an expected value of 0 Euros for Lottery A.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice of Lottery B over Lottery A because the certain gain of 2000 Euros was more appealing than the potential for either gaining or losing 3000 Euros in Lottery A, especially considering the expected value of Lottery A was 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential outcomes and their certainty, which aligns with the decision reason's focus on probable outcomes. However, the individual did not explicitly calculate or mention the average of probable outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes. The individual preferred Lottery B because of its certain gain over the risky outcomes of Lottery A, which implicitly suggests a preference for a more predictable, higher value (2000 Euros) over an average of 0 Euros from Lottery A. This reasoning aligns with preferring a higher average of probable outcomes, as Lottery B's single outcome of 2000 Euros is higher than Lottery A's average of probable outcomes (0 Euros).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, aligns closely with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, even though the individual did not explicitly calculate or mention these averages. The emphasis on the certainty of the gain in Lottery B and the comparison with the risky, zero-average outcome of Lottery A suggests that the decision reason was likely influential in the individual's decision-making process. However, the lack of explicit mention of calculating averages of probable outcomes introduces some uncertainty, preventing a 100% certainty assessment."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 = 0.5. Both outcomes of Lottery A have a probability of 0.5, which meets the threshold, so both are considered probable. For Lottery B, there is 1 outcome, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/1 = 1. Since the single outcome of Lottery B has a probability of 1, it is considered probable. The average of probable outcomes for Lottery A is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is 1000 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money in Lottery A and the guaranteed win in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it has no risk of losing money, and the win is certain, as opposed to Lottery A where there is a risk of losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the absence of risk in Lottery B and the presence of risk in Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: While both lead to a preference for Lottery B, the justification provided by the individual (avoidance of risk and certainty of gain) does not directly match the decision reason’s rule (comparing the average of probable outcomes).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The decision reason and the individual's justification both lead to choosing Lottery B, but the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the average of probable outcomes. The individual's focus is more on risk avoidance and certainty, which suggests that while the outcome might align with the decision reason, the thought process behind it does not directly reflect the decision reason's criteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as described, but there is a slight possibility due to the overlap in preference for Lottery B."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probable outcomes of each lottery, where an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than one divided by the number of lottery outcomes. For Lottery A, there are 2 outcomes, so an outcome is probable if its probability is higher than 1/2 or 50%. Both outcomes of Lottery A (6000 Euros with 50% probability and -6000 Euros with 50% probability) meet this criterion because their probabilities are exactly 50%, which is not higher but we will consider the context of the decision reason. For Lottery B, there is only 1 outcome (0 Euros with 100% probability), which is clearly probable. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the identification of probable outcomes and their values.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions the risk of losing 6000 Euros with a 50% probability as a key consideration.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justifies choosing Lottery B (0 Euros with 100% probability) by stating a preference for not risking a loss of 6000 Euros, even if it means not winning anything.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the average of probable outcomes, but the individual’s consideration is centered around the risk of loss, which indirectly relates to the probability and outcome values but does not explicitly mention calculating an average of probable outcomes.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with a higher average of probable outcomes, but the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding risk rather than comparing averages of probable outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual’s decision process as described does not directly align with the decision reason’s specific rule about averaging probable outcomes. The individual's focus is more on risk aversion and avoiding a potential loss rather than on calculating and comparing averages of probable outcomes. Therefore, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used as described.
