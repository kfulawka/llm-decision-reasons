STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 1% and the maximum probability is 66%, so the difference is 65%. For Lottery B, since there's only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), making the difference 0%. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a smaller difference (0%) compared to Lottery A (65%). The relevant information for this reason is the probabilities associated with each lottery's outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions a ""sehr geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit nichts zu gewinnen,"" which translates to ""very low probability of winning nothing."" This indicates the individual considered the probability of not winning (0 Euros outcome) in their deliberation.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification for choosing one lottery over the other but focuses on the low probability of not winning anything, which is directly related to Lottery A's 1% chance of winning 0 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual considered the low probability of winning nothing, which is part of the information relevant to the decision reason but does not directly compare the differences in probability ranges between the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probabilities, which would be Lottery B. The individual's focus on the low probability of winning nothing could indirectly suggest a preference for avoiding the uncertainty or risk associated with Lottery A, which aligns with preferring Lottery B but does not directly apply the decision reason's rule as stated.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's consideration of the low probability of winning nothing aligns with aspects of the decision reason, it does not directly apply the rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Therefore, the assessment leans towards uncertainty rather than certainty that the decision reason was used.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 34% and 66%, resulting in a difference of 32%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 33% and 67%, resulting in a difference of 34%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that the lotteries seem identical (""sich zu identisch""), indicating they considered the similarities between the two lotteries but does not specify which aspects (outcomes or probabilities) they focused on.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they made the decision based on feeling (""nach Gefühl gewählt""), which does not provide clear insight into the specific factors influencing their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires an analysis of the probabilities' differences, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's consideration of the lotteries being ""identical"" might imply a superficial comparison but does not directly relate to the probabilities' differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason involves a specific rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, whereas the individual's justification is based on intuition or feeling without specifying any rule or consideration of probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual used the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.

3,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certainty), resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences: 60% for Lottery A and 0% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of winning in Lottery A and the certainty of a high amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because, despite Lottery A having a high win probability, the certainty of getting a high amount (3000€) in Lottery B was more appealing, especially considering the amount.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability differences within each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considered the probability of winning and the certainty of the amounts, not the differences in probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (0% difference). However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the certainty of a high amount, not the probability differences within each lottery.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the certainty of the amount in Lottery B and the high win probability of Lottery A, not on the internal probability spreads of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 0% (implied, as the other outcome is 75% for 0 Euros), so the difference is 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 20% and 0% (implied, as the other outcome is 80% for 0 Euros), so the difference is 20%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: Difference = 25%
- Lottery B: Difference = 20%

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain and the risk, noting a 5% difference in probability but a higher potential gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified the choice by weighing the potential gain against the risk, finding the risk to be worth it for the higher potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in potential gain and the risk (implied by the mention of probability and being worth the risk), but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification focuses on the trade-off between the potential gain and the risk, not explicitly on the probability differences as defined by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the specific rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is central to the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 55% (of not winning) and the minimum is 45% (of winning), resulting in a difference of 10%. For Lottery B, the maximum probability is 90% (of winning) and the minimum is 10% (of not winning), resulting in a difference of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities, which are 10% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report is ""Hohe Gewinnwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""high winning probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of winning when making their decision. The justification for the choice seems to focus on the likelihood of winning, which is higher in Lottery B (90%) compared to Lottery A (45%). The described deliberation process emphasizes the importance of a high probability of winning.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (the high winning probability), it seems the individual focused more on the absolute probability of winning rather than the difference between the probabilities of winning and not winning. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification for the choice, as inferred from the verbal report, suggests a preference for the lottery with the higher winning probability, which is Lottery B. Given this, it does not appear the individual used the specific decision reason provided, as their focus was on the high probability of winning rather than the difference between the probabilities.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001), resulting in a difference of 0.001. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002), resulting in a difference of 0.002. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that both lotteries have very low probabilities of winning, implying they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states that they take a higher risk, but does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the low probabilities but did not explicitly mention comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is not explicitly mentioned in the individual's justification.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% for one outcome, making the minimum and maximum probabilities both 100%, hence the difference is 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences of 60% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of avoiding a loss (implied by ""eine kleine Wahrscheinlichkeit einen Verlust abzuwehren"") and compares the potential loss between the two lotteries (""verliert man nicht wirklich viel mehr als bei A""). This indicates the individual is thinking about the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, specifically focusing on the aspect of loss and its magnitude.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice by weighing the small chance of avoiding a significant loss against the guaranteed but smaller loss in Lottery A. The emphasis is on the comparative magnitude of potential losses and the existence of a small probability of avoiding loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on the magnitude of losses and the chance of avoiding loss. However, the individual's consideration of probabilities (albeit in the context of loss avoidance) shows some overlap with the concept of probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (0% difference). The individual's justification, while not explicitly mentioning probability differences, leans towards considering the implications of these differences (e.g., the chance of avoiding loss and comparative loss magnitudes), but does not directly apply the rule of minimizing the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly apply the decision reason's rule of preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. While there is some consideration of probabilities and their implications, the primary focus is on loss avoidance and comparative loss magnitudes rather than the specific rule provided by the decision reason. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used as the primary basis for the individual's decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference, which would be Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The verbal report mentions ""Leicht bessere Chancen einen Verlust zu vermeiden,"" which translates to ""slightly better chances of avoiding a loss."" This indicates the individual considered the probabilities of avoiding a loss (or gaining nothing) in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The report suggests the individual preferred the option that seemed to offer a better chance of avoiding a loss, without explicitly stating how the probabilities were compared or which specific probabilities were considered.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual seems to have considered the general idea of avoiding a loss, which relates to the higher probability of the 0 Euro outcome in each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities (Lottery B), and the individual's statement about avoiding a loss could align with preferring Lottery B, as it has a slightly higher probability (75%) of avoiding a loss compared to Lottery A (80% of avoiding a loss, but the statement does not explicitly compare the probabilities of loss directly).

Given these comparisons, the individual's focus on avoiding a loss could indirectly align with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the smaller difference in probabilities, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the differences in probabilities between the two lotteries. Therefore, while there's a possible alignment in the preference (both might lead to choosing Lottery B), the reasoning process described does not directly match the decision reason's criteria.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (-6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 10%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the higher loss in one of the lotteries but also the higher probability of avoiding this loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose based on the consideration that despite a potentially higher loss, the higher probability of avoiding this loss was a deciding factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which does not directly align with the individual's consideration of the magnitude of loss and the probability of avoiding it.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B with a 10% difference. However, the individual's justification does not explicitly mention comparing the ranges of probabilities but rather focuses on the trade-off between loss magnitude and avoidance probability.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The decision reason specifically looks at the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which does not directly match the considerations outlined in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems to be based more on the expected outcomes and their probabilities rather than the range of probabilities themselves.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 0.2% (or 0.002) and 99.8% (or 0.998), with a difference of 0.996. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 0.1% (or 0.001) and 99.9% (or 0.999), with a difference of 0.998. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. This step confirms that the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the low probability of incurring a loss in both lotteries, indicating they considered the probabilities of the outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual states they decided based on ""Gefühl"" (feeling), without explicitly mentioning the comparison of probability differences between the two lotteries.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities, but the individual's consideration, as described, focuses on the low probability of loss without mentioning the comparison of these differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, while the individual's justification is based on feeling, without reference to this specific rule.

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since it's a certain outcome), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a 0% difference, and Lottery B has a 50% difference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since one of the outcomes has 0% chance of occurring is not the case, but the lowest probability of an outcome is 50%) and the maximum probability is 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum and maximum probability are both 100% since there's only one outcome. Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 50% - 50% = 0% and for Lottery B is 100% - 100% = 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual seems to consider the aspect of risk, implying they are weighing the potential outcomes and possibly the certainty or uncertainty of those outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual suggests that taking the risk might be worthwhile because choosing the certain outcome (implied to be Lottery B) might be uninteresting or less appealing to someone who is a player or takes risks.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which was found to be 0% for both. The individual, however, discusses risk and the appeal of certain vs. uncertain outcomes, not directly mentioning probabilities or their differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), it would be indifferent. The individual's justification, however, seems to favor taking a risk, which doesn't directly align with the decision reason's rule of preferring based on probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 75% - 25% = 50%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 25% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual. The individual's statement ""Kommt mir ewas sicherer vor, überhaupt was zu gewinnen"" translates to ""Seems safer to me to win something at all."" This indicates the individual considered the aspect of winning something versus not winning anything, implying a focus on the presence of a guaranteed win or a higher chance of winning some amount.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification provided is about perceiving an option as safer in terms of winning something, which suggests the individual was looking for an option that offered a more secure or guaranteed outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is about the spread of probabilities. The individual seems to focus on the aspect of winning something, which could relate to the minimum guaranteed outcome but doesn't directly address the spread of probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification is about perceiving an option as safer to win something, which doesn't directly align with comparing the spreads of probabilities but could imply a preference for Lottery A due to its structure offering two positive outcomes, potentially making it seem ""safer"" in terms of winning something.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on winning something and perceiving an option as safer doesn't directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing the differences between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. While the individual's choice might coincidentally align with what the decision reason would prefer (Lottery A, due to its smaller difference in probability spread), the reasoning process described doesn't explicitly consider the probability spreads, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used."

The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 25% (for -6000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 75% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 50%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 25% (for both -4000 Euros and -2000 Euros) and the maximum probability is 50% (for 0 Euros), resulting in a difference of 25%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringere Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""lower loss probability."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losses in their decision-making process.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the justification but implies that the individual's focus was on minimizing loss probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which does not directly relate to the individual's consideration of ""lower loss probability."" The individual's focus seems to be more on the outcome (loss) rather than the probability range.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which is Lottery B with a difference of 25%. The individual's justification, as inferred, is about minimizing loss probability, which does not directly align with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's consideration and justification, as described in the verbal report, do not align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's emphasis on ""lower loss probability"" suggests a different decision-making criterion than the one specified by the decision reason.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's comment about Lottery B's winning probability being nearly 0 suggests an awareness of the probability aspect but does not directly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. The individual's justification, as provided, does not explicitly discuss comparing probability ranges or differences between the lotteries, only commenting on the low probability of winning in Lottery B.

Given these comparisons, the individual's verbal report does not directly indicate that they used the decision reason's specific rule (comparing the differences between minimum and maximum probabilities) to make their decision. The report hints at a consideration of probabilities but does not explicitly address the core of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""geringe Verlustwahrscheinlichkeit,"" which translates to ""low probability of loss."" This suggests the individual considered the probability of losing in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not explicitly state the individual's justification for choosing one lottery over the other but implies a focus on the probability of loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, while the individual considered the probability of loss. These are related but not directly the same, as the decision reason is more about the range of probabilities rather than the probability of a specific outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. The individual's focus on the ""low probability of loss"" could align with preferring Lottery A due to its very low probability of the significant loss, but this does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule about probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because the individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. While the individual considered the probability of loss, which is a component of the lotteries, the justification does not clearly reflect the decision reason's specific rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference in probability ranges."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is also 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. Thus, both lotteries have the same difference in minimum and maximum probabilities, which is 0%. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential high gain of Lottery B but also the possibility of a high loss. In contrast, they noted the security of the outcome in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by mentioning the attractiveness of the higher gain in Lottery B but ultimately decided on Lottery A due to the risk of a high loss, opting for the secure outcome instead.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's deliberation, as described, does not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries. Instead, they focus on the potential outcomes (high gain vs. high loss) and the security of one of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability. Since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose based on the security of the outcome and the risk associated with the high loss in Lottery B, not explicitly on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery as the basis for their decision. Instead, the focus was on the potential outcomes and the security of one lottery over the risk of the other. This suggests that the decision reason, which is based on the comparison of probability ranges, was not used by the individual to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the reason is about comparing these differences, we can derive that both lotteries have the same difference (0%), but the context implies the reason might be looking for a situation where one lottery has a clear advantage in terms of probability range. The relevant information is the probability ranges of both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considers the risk of loss and gain in Lottery A and compares it to the certainty of gaining a high amount in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to be weighing the uncertainty of Lottery A against the certainty of Lottery B, suggesting that the certainty of a high gain is attractive compared to the risk involved in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which does not directly align with the individual's focus on risk, certainty, and the attractiveness of a guaranteed high gain.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule about preferring the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability does not explicitly match the individual's justification, which is more about risk aversion and the value of certainty rather than the probability ranges themselves.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as the individual's considerations are more about the nature of risk and certainty rather than the technical aspect of probability differences.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the difference is 0% as well (since there's only one outcome). The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions ""faire Risiko bei A"" which translates to ""fair risk at A"", indicating an awareness of the risk associated with Lottery A. They also mention ""der sichere Gewinn bei B"" which translates to ""the secure win at B"", showing they considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual seems to weigh the risk of Lottery A against the certainty but lower reward of Lottery B, stating they would ""gerne in Kauf nimmt"" (gladly take) the risk for A, implying they find the potential reward worth the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. However, the individual's considerations as described in the verbal report do not explicitly mention comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries. Instead, they discuss the risk and the secure win.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a difference of 0%. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived value of risk versus certainty, not on the probability differences.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries as the basis for their decision. Their justification is centered around the risk and reward, not the probability ranges. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, so the difference is 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, so the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same, resulting in a difference of 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same difference (0%) between their minimum and maximum probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions ""zu großes Verlustrisiko bei A,"" which translates to ""too high loss risk at A."" This indicates the individual considered the risk of losing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's focus on the loss risk suggests their justification involves the potential downside of choosing Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's concern is about the loss risk, not the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the smaller difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would not differentiate between the two lotteries since both have a 0% difference. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived risk of loss, not on the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the risk of loss rather than the probability spread.
