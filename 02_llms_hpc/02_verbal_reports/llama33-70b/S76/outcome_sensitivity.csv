STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, focusing on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 2500 Euros, 2400 Euros, and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2400 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery: 
- Lottery B: Maximum = 2500 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
- Lottery A: Maximum = 2400 Euros, Minimum = 2400 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the low probability (1%) of winning nothing and the chance to win 100 Euros more than in Lottery A, indicating they considered the outcomes and their probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justifies their choice by weighing the low risk of winning nothing against the potential for a higher gain, suggesting they considered the trade-off between risk and potential reward.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual discusses the potential for a higher gain (implied by mentioning the chance to win 100 Euros more) and the low risk of the worst outcome, indicating they considered aspects related to the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the potential for a higher gain and the low risk of the worst outcome, which aligns with considering the maximum outcome (2500 Euros for Lottery B vs. 2400 Euros for Lottery A) and implicitly the minimum outcome (0 Euros for Lottery B vs. 2400 Euros for Lottery A).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the higher potential gain and the low risk of the worst outcome, as well as their emphasis on these aspects in justifying their choice, suggests that they likely used a reasoning process that aligns with the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that they compared the maximum and minimum outcomes as the primary basis for their decision, which is why the assessment is not 100. Nonetheless, the alignment between their considerations and the decision reason's criteria suggests a strong likelihood that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because it considers the outcomes of each lottery. The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 2400 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 2500 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. Since the maximum outcome of Lottery B (2500 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (2400 Euros), and the minimum outcomes are the same (0 Euros), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the monetary difference between the possible winnings (100 Euros) and compared it with the difference in probability (1 percentage point). The individual's justification for the choice is that the higher potential gain (2500 Euros) is only slightly less likely (by 1 percentage point), making the marginal increase in risk worthwhile for the significantly higher potential gain.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (the difference in potential winnings and the difference in probability), it's clear that the individual did consider the outcomes but focused more on the difference between the outcomes and the probabilities rather than simply comparing the maximum outcomes as the decision reason suggests. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B because of its higher maximum outcome (despite the slightly lower probability) aligns with the decision reason's preference for the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. This indicates that while the individual's thought process involved more nuanced considerations (including the balance between risk and reward), the core of the decision reason (preferring the higher maximum outcome) seems to be present in the individual's decision-making process.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences, preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries: 
- Maximum outcome for A: 3000 Euros
- Minimum outcome for A: 3000 Euros
- Maximum outcome for B: 4000 Euros
- Minimum outcome for B: 0 Euros
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions that both winning amounts are relatively high and notes the difference in the winning amounts between A and B, as well as the risk of a 20% chance of getting nothing with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual seems to weigh the risk of getting nothing (20% chance with Lottery B) against the potential higher gain, indicating that the difference in winning amounts is not high enough to justify taking the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The individual considers the winning amounts and the risk (implied by the 20% chance of getting nothing), which aligns with considering the outcomes and their differences as per the decision reason. However, the decision reason specifically focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes, which are not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as the sole or primary criteria for decision-making.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on the risk associated with the higher potential gain and does not explicitly state a preference based solely on the maximum or minimum outcomes. The individual's focus is more on the risk and the relative difference in potential gains rather than strictly adhering to the rule of preferring the higher maximum outcome (which would be Lottery B) or the more favorable minimum outcome (which would also be Lottery A, given its guaranteed outcome).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual considers aspects related to the decision reason (outcomes and their implications), the verbal report does not directly align with the specific rule of the decision reason (preferring the lottery based on maximum or minimum outcomes). The individual's decision seems to be influenced more by the perceived risk and the relative difference in outcomes rather than a straightforward application of the decision reason's rule."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences, preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. In this case, Lottery A offers a maximum outcome of 4000 Euros and a minimum of 0 Euros, while Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of 3000 Euros and a minimum of 0 Euros. Since the maximum outcome of Lottery A is higher than that of Lottery B, and the minimum outcomes are the same, the decision reason can be applied and would prefer Lottery A based on its more favorable maximum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in probabilities (5% less for Lottery A) and the difference in the potential winnings (a ""merklich höheren Gewinn"" or noticeably higher gain for Lottery A).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice by weighing the risk of a 5% lower probability against the potential for a higher gain, considering that the worst outcome in both cases is 0 Euros, which they frame as a ""Nullsummenspiel"" (a zero-sum game), implying no actual loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes of the lotteries, specifically preferring the one with the higher maximum outcome. The individual also considers the outcomes but frames their decision in terms of the trade-off between probability and the higher potential gain of Lottery A.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to a preference for Lottery A due to its higher maximum outcome. The individual's justification also leads to a preference for Lottery A, based on the noticeably higher potential gain, despite a slightly lower probability.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they prioritize the higher potential gain (maximum outcome) of Lottery A over the slightly higher probability of winning in Lottery B.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 90"

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with a 90% probability and 0 Euros with a 10% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 6000 Euros with a 45% probability and 0 Euros with a 55% probability. The maximum outcome for Lottery B (6000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (3000 Euros). Since the decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, the information relevant to this reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considers the high probability of winning something in Lottery A and the higher amount in Lottery B but notes its lower probability (under 50%). 
Second, the individual justifies the choice of Lottery A by stating it's the ""sichere Wahl"" (safe choice) because there's a very high probability of getting something, and uses the proverb ""Lieber den Spatz in der Hand als die Taube auf dem Dach"" (prefer a bird in the hand to one in the bush), indicating a preference for a more certain, albeit smaller, gain over a less certain, larger one.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (maximum outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of winning something and the amount), it seems the individual focuses more on the probability and certainty of the gain rather than directly comparing the maximum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome) to the individual’s justification (preferring the safer choice with a higher probability of a smaller gain), there appears to be a mismatch. The individual's justification emphasizes the certainty of the gain rather than the magnitude of the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The individual prioritizes the certainty of receiving a payout over the potential maximum payout, which contrasts with the decision reason's focus on the more favorable maximum outcome. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, specifically the differences between the outcomes, and prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome. Given the lotteries:
- Lottery B offers 6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability.
- Lottery A offers 3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.8% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The maximum outcome for Lottery B is 6000 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is 3000 Euros. The minimum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros. This information is sufficient for the decision reason to be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the very low probabilities of both lotteries A and B, noting they are close to each other, which suggests they considered the probabilities of the outcomes. However, the focus is on the potential surprise of winning a higher sum with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because, despite the low probabilities of winning, they would be more positively surprised by winning the higher amount offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes (maximum and minimum) of the lotteries. The individual considered the potential for a higher win with Lottery B, which aligns with focusing on the maximum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is based on the potential for a higher win (more favorable maximum outcome), which aligns with the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100 
The individual's focus on the higher potential win with Lottery B and their justification for choosing it based on this higher maximum outcome closely align with the decision reason's criteria for preferring a lottery. This suggests that the individual used the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason focuses on the outcomes of each lottery, considering the differences between them and preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are the same, the one with the more favorable minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 80% probability and 0 Euros with 20% probability. For Lottery B, the outcome is -3000 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries. In this case, the maximum outcome for Lottery A is 0 Euros (best outcome), and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros. The minimum outcome for Lottery A is -4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it remains -3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the possibility of ending up with no debt (0 Euros) in Lottery A, even though it's just theoretical, and acknowledges that Lottery B results in a certain but lesser debt.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies the choice based on the principle of hope, focusing on the chance, however small, of avoiding debt altogether with Lottery A, despite acknowledging that Lottery B leads to a lesser debt.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considers the possibility of no debt (0 Euros) in Lottery A and the certain debt in Lottery B, which aligns with focusing on outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The individual's justification is centered around the hope of avoiding debt (focusing on the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery A), which suggests they are prioritizing the more favorable maximum outcome, even if it's a less likely scenario.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's focus on the possibility of avoiding debt (the 0 Euro outcome in Lottery A) and their justification based on this hope aligns closely with the decision reason's emphasis on the more favorable maximum outcome. However, the verbal report does not explicitly discuss the comparison of minimum outcomes or the explicit preference rule as stated in the decision reason, introducing some uncertainty. Thus, while it appears the individual's decision-making process shares key elements with the decision reason, it is not a perfect match, leading to a high but not certain assessment."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, focusing on the differences between the outcomes. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -4000 Euros with 20% probability and 0 Euros with 80% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros with 25% probability and 0 Euros with 75% probability. The maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, which is the same, so according to the decision reason, we should look at the minimum outcome. The minimum outcome for Lottery A is -4000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is -3000 Euros. Since -3000 Euros is more favorable than -4000 Euros, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount to be lost in relation to the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries. They noted that the probability of losing (incurring debt) is slightly higher with Lottery B but still overall manageable, and they highlighted that the amount to be lost is significantly lower with Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the probability of loss against the amount of potential loss, indicating that while the probability of losing is slightly higher with Lottery B, the lower amount of potential loss was a decisive factor.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes of the lotteries, specifically the maximum and minimum outcomes. The individual considered the relationship between the potential loss and the probability of that loss, which indirectly touches upon the outcomes but does not explicitly compare the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason does.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome when the maximum outcomes are the same, which would lead to a preference for Lottery B. The individual's justification also leads to a preference for Lottery B but is based on a different consideration (the balance between the probability and amount of loss) rather than a direct comparison of the minimum outcomes.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision process and the decision reason both lead to a preference for Lottery B, but the individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not directly align with the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. The individual focuses on the relationship between loss amounts and their probabilities rather than directly comparing the minimum outcomes of the two lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B), the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's criteria, indicating that the decision reason was likely not used in the manner described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason to make the decision, we'll follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are identical, the one with the more favorable minimum outcome. For Lottery A and Lottery B, the outcomes are as follows:
- Lottery B: -6000 Euros with 45% probability, 0 Euros with 55% probability
- Lottery A: -3000 Euros with 90% probability, 0 Euros with 10% probability
The maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros (since it's the most favorable outcome in both cases), but since this outcome is the same for both, we look at the minimum outcomes. The minimum outcome for Lottery B is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery A, it's -3000 Euros. Thus, according to the decision reason, Lottery A would be preferred because it has a more favorable minimum outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers the probabilities of not incurring a loss (or ""ungeschoren davon zu kommen,"" which translates to ""getting away unscathed"" or not losing) for both lotteries. They note that for Lottery B, the probability of not losing (55%) is over 50%, implying a higher chance of not incurring a loss compared to a loss. For Lottery A, they mention that one makes ""relatively safe, albeit smaller losses,"" indicating an awareness of the higher probability of incurring a loss, albeit a smaller one.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual seems to justify their choice based on the likelihood of avoiding a loss and the relative safety of the loss amount. They appear to prioritize the higher probability of not losing in Lottery B and acknowledge the smaller but more certain loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual, however, discusses the probabilities of not incurring a loss and the relative safety of the losses, which indirectly touches upon the outcomes but focuses more on the probabilities and the concept of ""getting away unscathed.""

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable minimum outcome when the maximum outcomes are the same. The individual's justification, however, seems to weigh the probabilities of avoiding a loss and the size of the potential loss, rather than directly comparing the minimum outcomes as the primary decision criterion.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual's thought process and the decision reason overlap in considering the outcomes but differ in how these outcomes are evaluated and prioritized. The individual focuses on the probability of avoiding a loss and the size of the loss, which aligns partially with considering outcomes but does not directly apply the rule of preferring the lottery based solely on the more favorable minimum outcome when maximum outcomes are equal.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
This assessment reflects a low likelihood that the individual used the decision reason as described, given the focus on probabilities of loss and relative safety rather than a direct comparison of maximum and minimum outcomes as the primary decision criterion."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, focusing on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -3000 Euros and 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries. Since both lotteries have the same minimum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would compare the maximum outcomes to make a preference decision. In this case, since one lottery offers a less severe loss (-3000 Euros for Lottery B vs. -6000 Euros for Lottery A), the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of a loss between the two lotteries and noted it was small. They then focused on the absolute numbers of the potential losses.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided to choose the lottery with the smaller absolute loss, implying they preferred the less severe loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes (maximum and minimum) of the lotteries, while the individual considered the difference in probabilities of loss and the absolute numbers of potential losses. The individual's consideration aligns with focusing on the outcomes, specifically the maximum loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome (or minimum, if maximum outcomes are the same), which in this context means the less severe loss. The individual's justification also prefers the lottery with the less severe loss, aligning with the decision reason's rule.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual considered the differences in outcomes (specifically, the maximum potential loss) and made a decision based on preferring the less severe loss, which aligns with the decision reason provided.

11,"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 1000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes, which are: maximum outcome of Lottery A is 1000 Euros, minimum outcome of Lottery A is 0 Euros, and the outcome of Lottery B is 500 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Since Lottery A has a higher maximum outcome (1000 Euros) than Lottery B (500 Euros), the decision reason would prefer Lottery A based on the maximum outcome. However, it's also important to consider the individual's thought process as described in the verbal report.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the probabilities of the lotteries and notes that Lottery A has a 50/50 chance, which they liken to a coin toss. They also mention the importance of financial security and a ""take what you can get"" mentality.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by preferring the safer option to avoid regret over potentially getting nothing. They express a preference for financial security, indicating that the certainty of getting 500 Euros is more appealing than the risk of getting either 1000 Euros or nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the outcomes (maximum and minimum) of the lotteries, while the individual considers the probabilities and the concept of financial security. There's a mismatch in the focus; the individual is more concerned with the certainty of the outcome rather than its maximum potential.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum outcome (Lottery A), but the individual prefers the safer, guaranteed outcome of Lottery B due to a desire for financial security. This indicates that the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, which prioritizes the maximum potential outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, focusing on the differences between the maximum and minimum outcomes. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -1000 Euros and 0 Euros, with the latter being the maximum (more favorable) outcome. For Lottery A, the outcome is a fixed -500 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of both lotteries: 
- Lottery B has a maximum outcome of 0 Euros and a minimum outcome of -1000 Euros.
- Lottery A has a fixed outcome of -500 Euros, which serves as both the maximum and minimum outcome.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual mentions considering the guaranteed loss of Lottery A and the risk of losing more with Lottery B but also the possibility of not losing anything (keeping their money). This implies the individual considered the outcomes of both lotteries, specifically the risk associated with Lottery B and the certainty of loss in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual's justification seems to lean towards the potential benefit of avoiding any loss with Lottery B, despite the risk of a greater loss. This suggests the individual is weighing the potential upside (no loss) against the downside (greater loss) in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considered the potential of not losing with Lottery B (maximum outcome of 0 Euros) and the guaranteed loss of Lottery A. This alignment suggests the individual did consider the type of information the decision reason deems important.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. Lottery B offers a maximum outcome of 0 Euros, which is more favorable than Lottery A's outcome of -500 Euros. The individual's justification hints at being attracted to the possibility of not losing (0 Euros outcome), which aligns with preferring the lottery based on its more favorable maximum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason's focus on maximum outcomes and the consideration of potential gains (or lesser losses) as a decisive factor.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery, focusing on the maximum and minimum outcomes. For Lottery A, the maximum outcome is 4000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the maximum outcome is 6000 Euros and the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The key points are:
- Lottery A: Maximum = 4000 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
- Lottery B: Maximum = 6000 Euros, Minimum = 0 Euros
Since both lotteries have the same minimum outcome (0 Euros), the decision reason would prefer the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, which is Lottery B with 6000 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual mentions the importance of winning something at all and notes that the probability of winning (any amount) is twice as high with Lottery A as with Lottery B, even though the amounts won are consistently lower.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the probability of winning any amount and the comparative probabilities between the two lotteries rather than directly on the maximum or minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries, whereas the individual discusses the probability of winning any amount and comparative probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the maximum outcome (or minimum if maximums are equal), but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on its maximum or minimum outcome. Instead, the focus is on the probability of winning.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was more on the probability of winning any amount rather than the specific outcomes (maximum or minimum) of the lotteries.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The maximum outcome for both lotteries is 0 Euros, which is the same. The minimum outcome for Lottery A is -6000 Euros, and for Lottery B, it is -4000 Euros. The decision reason can be applied by comparing these outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing money in both lotteries and noted that the probability of losing money is higher in Lottery B (50% chance of losing money) compared to Lottery A (25% chance of losing money, implicitly, as the remaining 75% is winning nothing). The individual also noted the absolute amount of potential loss is higher in Lottery A.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to justify their choice based on the comparison of the probabilities of losing money and the absolute amounts of potential loss, highlighting the higher probability of losing in Lottery B and the higher potential loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considered the probabilities of losing and the amounts of potential loss, which indirectly touches upon the outcomes but focuses more on the risk aspect rather than the direct comparison of maximum and minimum outcomes as stated in the decision reason.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly follow this rule, as it emphasizes the probability of losing and the magnitude of loss rather than directly comparing the most favorable and least favorable outcomes as the basis for the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's verbal report does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on comparing maximum and minimum outcomes to make a choice. Instead, the report emphasizes the probabilities of losing money and the magnitude of potential losses, which, while related, does not follow the specific rule outlined in the decision reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences, preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. In this case, Lottery A offers a certain 5 Euros, while Lottery B offers 5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability and 0 Euros with a 99.9% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are as follows:
- Lottery A: Maximum outcome = 5 Euros, Minimum outcome = 5 Euros.
- Lottery B: Maximum outcome = 5000 Euros, Minimum outcome = 0 Euros.
This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the certainty of receiving 5 Euros (instant gratification) versus the very low probability of receiving 5000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual prefers the certain 5 Euros because it translates into immediate satisfaction (e.g., a meal), over hoping for the higher amount with a very low probability.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual focuses on the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A and the low probability of the higher outcome of Lottery B, which aligns with considering the outcomes but does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason does.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery based on the maximum or minimum outcomes, but the individual's justification emphasizes the preference for certainty and immediate gratification over a low-probability high reward, not explicitly comparing the outcomes based on their maximum or minimum values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing maximum and minimum outcomes to make a choice. Instead, the individual's focus is on the certainty of the outcome and its immediate utility, which suggests that while the outcomes are considered, the decision reason's specific criteria (maximum and then minimum outcomes) are not explicitly used. Thus, it is unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -5000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the outcome is -5 Euros. The maximum outcome for Lottery B is 0 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -5 Euros. The minimum outcome for Lottery B is -5000 Euros, and for Lottery A, it is -5 Euros. Since the maximum outcomes are not identical (0 Euros for B vs. -5 Euros for A), the decision reason would prefer Lottery B based on the maximum outcome. However, considering the context of the decision reason focusing on ""more favorable"" outcomes, it seems there might be an interpretation where the certain loss of -5 Euros is seen as more favorable than the potential large loss of -5000 Euros, despite the very low probability of the latter. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, the information considered by the individual includes the high potential loss of Lottery B (-5000 Euros) and its very low probability, compared to the certain but small loss of Lottery A (-5 Euros). 
Second, the individual’s justification for the choice focuses on avoiding the high risk associated with Lottery B due to its potential for a significant loss, despite the low probability, in favor of the certain but minor loss of Lottery A. The individual seems to weigh the potential impact of the losses rather than strictly following the rule of choosing based on the maximum or minimum outcomes.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and their differences) with that considered by the individual (potential losses and their probabilities), it appears the individual considered the essence of what the decision reason evaluates but with an emphasis on the perceived risk and impact rather than a straightforward application of maximum or minimum outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if equal, the more favorable minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification (avoiding the high potential loss due to its significant impact despite low probability), it seems the individual's decision process aligns more with a risk-averse approach rather than a strict application of the decision reason’s rule. The individual prioritizes avoiding a significant loss over the potential for a better maximum outcome, which suggests a consideration of the outcomes but not necessarily in the manner the decision reason prescribes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries and their potential impact, the decision process described in the verbal report does not strictly follow the decision reason's rule of preferring based on maximum or minimum outcomes. Instead, it focuses on risk aversion and the perceived significance of potential losses, indicating that the decision reason was not the primary basis for the individual's choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the given steps:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences, focusing on the maximum and minimum outcomes to make a preference decision. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from these outcomes and probabilities. The maximum outcome for Lottery B is 3000 Euros, and the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros. For Lottery A, both the maximum and minimum outcome are 1500 Euros. This information is relevant for applying the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the potential gain from Lottery B not being high enough to outweigh the perceived danger of high debt and the guaranteed security of Lottery A. They also considered the potential regret of choosing Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the balance between potential gain and the risk of significant loss (high debt), emphasizing the importance of the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considered the potential high gain and significant loss associated with Lottery B, as well as the guaranteed security of Lottery A. While the individual's consideration of outcomes aligns with the decision reason's focus on outcomes, the individual's emphasis is more on the risk aspect and the guarantee of Lottery A rather than directly comparing the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason prescribes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification, however, is based on the perceived risk and the value of a guaranteed outcome, which indirectly relates to the decision reason but does not directly apply its rule of comparing maximum and minimum outcomes to make the decision.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of prioritizing the maximum and then the minimum outcomes. While the individual considers the outcomes of the lotteries, the emphasis on risk, regret, and the guarantee suggests that the decision reason, as defined, was not the primary basis for the individual's choice. Thus, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used by the individual, but there is some overlap in the considerations, which is why the assessment is not 0."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences. For Lottery A, the outcome is 2000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. The maximum outcome of Lottery B (3000 Euros) is more favorable than that of Lottery A (2000 Euros), but the minimum outcome of Lottery B (-3000 Euros) is less favorable than that of Lottery A (2000 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considers the difference in gains between the two lotteries (A and B) and the high risk of a significant loss associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by weighing the difference in gains against the risk of loss, indicating that the gain difference is significant enough to compensate for the high risk of loss in Lottery B, and the secure gain in Lottery A is tempting.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considers the gain difference and the risk (which can be related to the outcomes), which aligns with the decision reason's focus on outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification focuses on the balance between the potential gain and the risk of loss, which indirectly considers the maximum and minimum outcomes but does not explicitly state a preference based on these outcomes alone.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning process involves considering the outcomes and their implications (gains and risks), which is in line with the decision reason's focus on outcomes. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the choice was made solely based on the maximum and minimum outcomes as the decision reason dictates. The individual seems to balance the potential for higher gain against the risk of significant loss, which suggests an element of risk assessment beyond just comparing maximum and minimum outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and their differences, focusing on the maximum and minimum outcomes to make a preference decision. For Lottery A, the outcome is 1000 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the outcomes are 3000 Euros with 50% probability and -3000 Euros with 50% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason includes the maximum and minimum outcomes of each lottery: Lottery A has a maximum and minimum of 1000 Euros, while Lottery B has a maximum of 3000 Euros and a minimum of -3000 Euros. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, making the decision reason applicable.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the ""Sicherheit eines garantierten, relativ hohen Gewinns"" (security of a guaranteed, relatively high win), which refers to Lottery A's guaranteed 1000 Euros, and compares it to the risk of ""sehr hohe Schulden"" (very high debts) associated with Lottery B, indicating they considered the outcomes and their implications.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies their choice by stating that the higher amount offered by Lottery B is ""nicht attraktive genug"" (not attractive enough) when considering the probability of winning or losing, implying a risk assessment that weighs the potential gains against the potential losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes, which are explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as key considerations (the guaranteed win of Lottery A versus the potential high loss of Lottery B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome or, if the maximum outcomes are the same, the more favorable minimum outcome. The individual's justification, while not explicitly stating a preference for the maximum or minimum outcome based on the decision reason's criteria, implies a consideration of the potential outcomes and their attractiveness, which aligns with evaluating the lotteries based on their outcomes.

Given these comparisons, the individual's deliberation process, as described, aligns with considering the outcomes of the lotteries and their implications, which is central to the decision reason. However, the verbal report does not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes first and then the minimum outcomes as a decision rule. Instead, it focuses on the attractiveness of the guaranteed win versus the risk of loss, suggesting an evaluation based on risk preference rather than a straightforward application of the decision reason's rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
This assessment reflects that while the individual considered the outcomes of the lotteries, which is in line with the decision reason, the explicit rule of preferring the lottery based on maximum and then minimum outcomes if the maximums are the same is not clearly articulated in the verbal report. The individual's focus on the security of a guaranteed win and the unattractiveness of the risk associated with Lottery B suggests an alignment with the spirit of considering outcomes but does not perfectly match the decision reason's specific criteria."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the outcomes of each lottery and prefers the one with the more favorable maximum outcome, or if the maximum outcomes are identical, the more favorable minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the outcomes are 6000 Euros and -6000 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcome is 0 Euros with 100% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes: Lottery A has a maximum outcome of 6000 Euros and a minimum outcome of -6000 Euros, while Lottery B has a constant outcome of 0 Euros. This information is sufficient to apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 50/50 chance of incurring significant debt with Lottery A and the absence of loss risk but also the absence of a gain chance with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by preferring the safer option (Lottery B) due to the risk of significant debt associated with Lottery A, indicating a focus on avoiding loss rather than seeking the highest potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the maximum and minimum outcomes of the lotteries. The individual considered the risk of significant debt (related to the minimum outcome of Lottery A) but did not explicitly mention comparing the maximum outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would prioritize Lottery A due to its more favorable maximum outcome (6000 Euros) compared to Lottery B (0 Euros), or if considering the minimum outcomes because they are identical in the sense that one has a negative outcome and the other does not, it might still prioritize based on the absence of a negative outcome in B. However, the individual's justification emphasizes avoiding loss, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes but does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of prioritizing the maximum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on avoiding loss and their decision to choose the safer option (Lottery B) suggests some alignment with considering outcomes, but their justification does not explicitly follow the decision reason's rule of prioritizing the lottery with the more favorable maximum outcome. The verbal report indicates a concern for the risk of debt, which relates to the minimum outcome, but the decision reason's primary focus is on the maximum outcomes. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for the individual's choice."
