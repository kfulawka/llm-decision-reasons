Decision reason:
The reason considers the expected value of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value.

Verbal report:
Ich habe zunächst die Infos von B aufgedeckt und mich dann A gewidmet. Ich habe die Werte von A und B verglichen und gesehen, dass ich mit fast 100 Prozentiger Warscheinlichkeit mit einem Gewinnn rechnen könnte, der ggf. sogar noch um 100 Euro im Vergleich zu B erhöht wäre.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is calculated as (2500 * 0.33) + (2400 * 0.66) + (0 * 0.01). This simplifies to 825 + 1584 = 2409 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is 2400 Euros with 100% probability, so it remains 2400 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can indeed be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially examined the information of Lottery B and then focused on Lottery A. They compared the values of A and B, noting a high probability of winning an amount that could be up to 100 Euros more than B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by considering the comparison of potential winnings between the two lotteries, focusing on the high probability of winning a potentially higher amount with Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the calculation or consideration of expected values. While the individual compared the values and considered probabilities, there's no explicit mention of calculating expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification seems to lean towards choosing the lottery that offers a potential for a higher win with a high probability, which aligns with preferring a higher expected outcome but does not explicitly state it in terms of expected value calculations.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's verbal report indicates a consideration of the potential outcomes and their probabilities, which aligns with the components needed to calculate expected values. However, there's no explicit mention of calculating or directly comparing expected values as the decision reason suggests. The justification provided leans towards preferring a potentially higher outcome with high probability, which could imply an intuitive understanding or approximation of expected value without directly applying the decision reason as defined. Therefore, while there's some alignment, it's not a perfect match, leading to a score that indicates a leaning towards the use of the decision reason but with uncertainty."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason requires calculating the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is calculated as (2500 * 0.33) + (0 * 0.67) = 825 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (2400 * 0.34) + (0 * 0.66) = 816 Euros. Since EV_A > EV_B, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The relevant information for this reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing the significance of receiving money versus the amount, focusing on the slight difference in probabilities of receiving money.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided in favor of having a slightly greater probability of receiving money, implying they chose Lottery B due to its slightly higher probability (34% vs 33%) of winning, despite the lower potential gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (difference in probabilities and amounts): The individual does not mention expected values but focuses on the probability of winning and the amount.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (preferring the higher probability of winning over the amount): The individual’s justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule since they prioritize the probability of receiving any money over the expected monetary value.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the expected values of the lotteries. Instead, they based their decision on the probability of receiving money and the comparative amounts, without considering the expected value as the primary criterion.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is (4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 3200 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is (3000 * 1) = 3000 Euros. Since EV_A > EV_B, the decision reason would prefer Lottery A. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery A (mentioned as ""Wahrscheinlichkeit viel zu erhalten sehr groß war"" which translates to ""the probability of getting it was very high"") and compared it to a threshold (around 70%) beyond which they would have chosen the safer option B. They also mentioned not having a loss in Option A as a factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the high probability of winning (80%) made the scenario favorable to them. They also imply that below a certain probability threshold (around 70%), they would have opted for the safer, guaranteed option B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values calculated from outcomes and probabilities. The individual considered the probability of winning and the absence of loss but did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. The individual's justification focuses on the high probability of winning and the absence of potential loss, rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

Given these comparisons, while the individual's decision aligns with the outcome of the decision reason (preferring Lottery A), the verbal report does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values as the basis for the decision. The individual's focus was more on the probability of winning and the guarantee of no loss rather than the expected monetary value of each option.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 
This assessment indicates that while the individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest, the verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the decision reason (comparing expected values) was explicitly used in making the decision. The justification provided in the report focuses on different aspects (probability and absence of loss) than the decision reason (expected value)."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries. For Lottery A, the expected value is (4000 * 0.2) + (0 * 0.8) = 800 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 750 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 800 Euros for Lottery A and 750 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of receiving money, the possibility of receiving a small amount of money, and the importance of receiving any amount of money. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the higher probability of receiving money, which suggests that the individual prioritized the chance of getting any positive outcome over the potential amount of money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probability of receiving money, possibility of receiving a small amount of money): The individual does not explicitly mention considering the expected values of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (prioritizing the chance of getting any positive outcome): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritizes the probability of receiving money over the expected value.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the expected values of the lotteries or preferred the lottery with the higher expected value. Instead, the individual prioritized the probability of receiving any amount of money, which suggests that a different decision reason was used. Therefore, I am certain that the decision reason considering the expected value of each lottery was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = 2700 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = 2700 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the expected values of the two lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the significant difference in the potential sums of money and the consideration of not losing money, indicating a focus on the potential outcomes and the risk aspect.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided based on the potential for a higher sum and the absence of risk in losing money, not explicitly mentioning the calculation or comparison of expected values but focusing on the potential gain and risk avoidance.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (potential sums and risk): The individual's considerations do not explicitly align with calculating or comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (potential for a higher sum and risk avoidance): The individual's justification does not directly reflect a comparison of expected values but rather a qualitative assessment of potential outcomes and risk.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process as described does not explicitly align with the decision reason that focuses on the expected value of the lotteries. The verbal report emphasizes the potential for gain and the avoidance of loss rather than a direct comparison of the expected outcomes of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as EV = (probability of winning * amount to win). For Lottery A, EV = 0.002 * 3000 = 6 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = 0.001 * 6000 = 6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value, 6 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating and summarizing the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions not believing they would receive money in this scenario but still decided to go for the option that offers a chance, however small, to gain. They considered the positive outcome of their choice as not really relevant due to its improbability.
Second, evaluating and summarizing the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the desire to choose an option that at least offers a possibility of gain, despite considering the outcome unlikely and thus the decision feeling somewhat irrelevant.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) with that considered by the individual: The individual does not mention comparing the expected values or any form of numerical comparison between the two options. They focus on the improbability of winning and the desire to choose an option that offers any chance of gain.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since both lotteries have the same expected value, the decision reason would suggest indifference. However, the individual's justification is based on the desire for any possible gain, not on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they considered the expected values of the lotteries or used a comparison of these values to make their decision. Their focus was on the existence of any chance of gain, regardless of its probability, rather than on the numerical outcomes or probabilities that underlie the calculation of expected value. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason, which is based on comparing expected values, was not used by the individual to make the decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the higher expected value. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-4000 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = -3200 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 1) = -3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are -3200 Euros for Lottery A and -3000 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the values and considering the 20% probability of not losing more money in Lottery A, as well as the difference in potential losses between the two lotteries. Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by stating that a 20% probability was not enough to risk an additional 1000 Euro loss, implying they were considering the potential losses and the probability of those losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason relies on the expected values of the lotteries, which are based on both the outcomes and their probabilities. The individual considered the probabilities and the outcomes (in terms of potential losses) but does not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which in this case would be Lottery B since -3000 Euros is greater than -3200 Euros. The individual's justification focuses on the risk of additional loss and the insufficiency of the 20% probability to justify that risk, which aligns with preferring the lesser loss (Lottery B) but does not directly mention expected values or their comparison.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 40
The individual's decision-making process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on expected values. While the individual considered factors that influence expected value (outcomes and probabilities), the justification provided does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or using this comparison as the basis for the decision. However, the choice made (preferring the lesser loss) coincidentally aligns with what the expected value calculation would suggest. Therefore, it's uncertain whether the decision reason was used, but given the lack of direct reference to expected values, the assessment leans towards the decision reason not being used, hence a score below 50."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the steps outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV = (-3000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -750 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV = (-4000 * 0.20) + (0 * 0.80) = -800 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries, and the expected values are -750 Euros for Lottery A and -800 Euros for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason prefers Lottery A over Lottery B based on expected value.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the comparison of the values (outcomes and their probabilities) and focused on the probabilities when the sums (outcomes) did not strongly differ. They noted that small differences in probabilities could lead to significant differences in potential loss, which was decisive in their selection. Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B, despite the possibility of losing 1000 Euros more, was based on a difference in probabilities (mentioned as 5 percentage points) being significant enough to outweigh the potential greater loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values based on outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and their impact on potential loss), it appears the individual focused more on the probabilities and their differences rather than directly calculating or considering the expected values of the lotteries. Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference for the lottery with the higher expected value) with the individual's justification (focus on probability differences and their impact on potential loss), it seems the individual did not directly apply the expected value rule. Instead, they considered the potential losses and the probabilities of those losses, which led to a decision that does not align with the expected value calculation (since Lottery A has a higher expected value but the individual chose Lottery B).

The expected value (EV) is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (-6000 * 0.45) + (0 * 0.55) = -2700 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (-3000 * 0.9) + (0 * 0.1) = -2700 Euros. Since the expected values can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities of losing money in both options, the amount of money to be lost, and the difference in these amounts between the two options. They also mentioned that the perception of loss and the magnitude of the potential loss influenced their decision.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice based on the perceived risk of losing a significant amount of money, with Option B being seen as having too high a probability of loss, and the comparative magnitude of potential losses between the two options. The individual also mentioned that their decision would have changed with a different difference in the amounts to be lost.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the expected value, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual considers probabilities and outcomes but frames them in terms of perceived risk and the magnitude of potential losses rather than calculating or directly comparing expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification is based on a more subjective evaluation of risk and loss aversion, not explicitly on which lottery has a higher expected value. Given that both lotteries have the same expected value (-2700 Euros), the decision reason would suggest indifference, but the individual's justification does not align with this rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 

The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason based on expected value to make their decision. Instead, their justification focuses on the perceived risk of loss and the magnitude of potential losses, without mention of calculating or comparing expected values. This suggests that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated using the outcomes and their probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV_A) is calculated as: EV_A = (-6000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = -6 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value (EV_B) is calculated as: EV_B = (-3000 * 0.002) + (0 * 0.998) = -6 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions looking at the values and noticing the high probability (99.x%) of receiving 0 Euros, which led them to focus on the potential loss. They considered the difference in probabilities (0.1% vs. 0.2%) as not making a significant difference in their perception. Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual decided based on minimizing the potential loss, considering they would likely not experience the loss anyway, and thus chose the option with the lesser loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of receiving 0 Euros and the perceived difference in probabilities), it appears the individual did not directly consider the expected values in their decision-making process. Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification (choosing the option with the lesser potential loss due to the high probability of not experiencing the loss), it seems the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason’s rule. The individual focused on minimizing loss rather than comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of expected values to compare the lotteries, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on minimizing potential loss and the perceived insignificance of the probability differences do not align with the decision reason's emphasis on expected value comparison.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is (1000 Euros * 50%) + (0 Euros * 50%) = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (500 Euros * 100%) = 500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 500 Euros for both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the amount of money involved and the risk associated with each option, mentioning that the amounts are somewhat lower than previous options and that they decided to go for the safer option of receiving 500 Euros due to the risk not being worth it for an additional 500 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by stating that the risk of potentially losing out on 500 Euros was not worth the potential gain of an additional 500 Euros, indicating a risk-averse attitude influenced by previous decisions.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, which are equal for both lotteries. The individual considered the risk and the amount of money, which indirectly relates to expected value but focuses more on the risk aspect.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, it would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, indicates a preference for the safer option due to risk aversion, not directly because of comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, since the individual's focus was on risk aversion and the perceived value of the risk rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. For Lottery A, the EV is calculated as (-1000 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the EV is -500 Euros with 100% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason (expected values of both lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not losing money (1/2 for Lottery A), the difference in the sums of the potential losses, and the relative impact of losing 500 Euros versus 1000 Euros.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual seems to weigh the realistic chance of not losing money with Lottery A against the certainty of losing a smaller amount with Lottery B. They also consider the psychological impact of the loss amounts.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on expected values, but the individual's considerations, as described, do not explicitly mention calculating or comparing expected values. They focus more on the probabilities of outcomes and the psychological impact of potential losses.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but the individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on its expected value. Instead, they discuss the probability of not losing and the relative sizes of the losses.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason that focuses on expected values to make their decision. Their deliberation process, as described, emphasizes other aspects of the decision problem.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated from the given outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the expected value (EV) is (6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (4000 * 0.25) + (2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = 1500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value, and the decision reason would be indifferent between them. The relevant information for the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which is 1500 Euros for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the overall probability of winning any amount of money and compared it between the two lotteries. They also thought about the value of receiving a gain versus no gain.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning any amount of money was 25% higher than in Lottery A, and they preferred receiving some gain over no gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (overall probability of winning and preference for any gain): The individual did not explicitly mention calculating or comparing the expected values of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (prefer the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferred Lottery B due to a higher overall probability of winning any amount and the preference for some gain over no gain): The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule since the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries due to their equal expected values, but the individual preferred Lottery B based on different criteria.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason that considers the expected value of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning any amount of money and the preference for receiving some gain, not on comparing the expected values of the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. To apply this reason, we need to calculate the expected value of each lottery. The expected value (EV) of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A: EV = (-6000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.75) = -1500 Euros. For Lottery B: EV = (-4000 * 0.25) + (-2000 * 0.25) + (0 * 0.50) = -1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason is the expected value of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Both lotteries have the same expected value of -1500 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of losing money in both lotteries, specifically mentioning the 25% chance of losing more money and the fact that with Lottery A, there's a high probability (actually stated as 72%, which seems to be a misunderstanding since the probability of not losing money with A is 75%) of not making a loss. 
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice by weighing the probability of losing more money against the amounts to be lost, implying a consideration of the trade-offs between different outcomes and their probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason requires the calculation of expected values, which involves considering all outcomes and their probabilities. The individual, however, focused on the probabilities of losing money and the amounts, without explicitly mentioning the calculation of expected values or comparing the overall expected outcomes of both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would suggest indifference. The individual's justification, however, does not explicitly mention comparing expected values or preferring one lottery based on its expected value. Instead, it focuses on the perceived risks and potential losses, suggesting a different decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's verbal report does not indicate the use of expected values as the basis for their decision, which is the core of the decision reason provided. The focus on probabilities of loss and the amounts to be lost, without calculating or comparing expected values, suggests that the individual did not use the decision reason as described."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value (EV) of each lottery. The expected value of a lottery is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, EV = (5000 * 0.001) + (0 * 0.999) = 5 Euros. For Lottery B, EV = (5 * 1) = 5 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same expected value of 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual focused on the probability of winning in Lottery A, considering it too low, and compared the probabilities of the two lotteries. They also mentioned that a small certain gain is more valuable to them than no gain, indicating a consideration of the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of winning in Lottery A was too low, and they valued a small certain gain over a potentially much larger but highly uncertain gain. They also considered a hypothetical scenario where the probability of winning in Lottery A increased, which would have led them to choose Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's decision process, as described, focused more on the comparison of probabilities and the certainty of a small gain rather than explicitly calculating or comparing expected values.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, but since both lotteries have the same expected value, the reason would be indifferent. However, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the value of a certain small gain, not explicitly on which lottery had a higher expected value.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not directly apply the decision reason of choosing the lottery with the higher expected value, as their justification was more aligned with risk aversion and the value of certainty rather than a straightforward comparison of expected values.

Beim Schreiben merke ich aber allerdings, dass ich mich vermutlichin einer anderen Situation tritzdem für A entscheieden hätte.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value (EV) of each lottery, calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the EV is -5 Euros (since -5 Euros * 100% = -5 Euros). For Lottery B, the EV is -5 Euros (since -5000 Euros * 0.1% + 0 Euros * 99.9% = -5 Euros). The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) can be derived from the lotteries. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual initially considered their intuition (""Bauchgefühl"") for choosing Lottery A but then reconsidered. They mention the low probability of losing 5000 Euros in Lottery B, implying they considered the outcomes and probabilities of the lotteries to some extent.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to be based on the low probability of the significant loss in Lottery B, which led them to reconsider their initial choice. They also mention that in another situation, they might have chosen differently, indicating some level of ambiguity in their decision-making process.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes and probabilities) with that considered by the individual, it appears the individual did consider the probabilities and outcomes, at least to some extent. However, there's no explicit mention of calculating or comparing the expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification, the individual's reasoning does not explicitly align with the decision reason. The individual's focus is more on the perceived risk and intuition rather than a calculated preference based on expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The assessment is low because, while the individual considered the probabilities and outcomes of the lotteries, there is no clear indication that they used the expected value calculation as the basis for their decision. The verbal report suggests a more intuitive and risk-perception-based decision-making process rather than a strict application of the expected value rule."

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which can be calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability. For Lottery A, the expected value is (3000 * 0.5) + (-3000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (1500 * 1) = 1500 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing money in Lottery A and the guarantee of receiving a sum in Lottery B. They were aware of the potential loss in Lottery A from the beginning and focused on receiving a sum, regardless of its amount, as long as the difference between the sums is not immensely different.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by emphasizing their reluctance to take the risk of losing money, which led them to prefer the guaranteed option, Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason relies on expected values, but the individual's considerations centered around risk aversion and the guarantee of receiving a sum, without explicitly mentioning expected values.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value (Lottery B), which aligns with the individual's choice. However, the individual's justification is based on risk aversion and the desire for a guaranteed outcome, not explicitly on comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision aligns with the decision reason's outcome (preferring Lottery B), but the reasoning process described in the verbal report does not directly match the decision reason's rule (comparing expected values). The individual's focus on risk aversion and the guarantee of an outcome suggests a different decision-making process. Therefore, while there is some alignment in the outcome, the process described does not strongly indicate the use of the decision reason based on expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason, which considers the expected value of each lottery and prefers the one with the higher expected value, was used by the individual, we follow the step-by-step process as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason is based on the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery A, the expected value is 2000 Euros * 100% = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are 2000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of making a significant loss to gain more, comparing the potential gain of Lottery B over Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A because the difference between the gains of A and B would have had to be much greater to justify the risk of a large loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk and potential gains, which indirectly relates to the expected value concept but focuses more on the risk aspect rather than calculating or directly comparing expected values.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher expected value, which would be Lottery A in this case. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A but based on the risk and the required difference in gains to justify that risk, rather than explicitly comparing expected values.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing the expected values of the lotteries but rather focuses on the risk and potential gains. While the outcome of the individual's decision aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery A), the reasoning process described does not directly reflect the application of the decision reason based on expected values. Therefore, the assessment is that the decision reason was likely not used in the manner it is defined, focusing on expected values."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery, which is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For Lottery A, the expected value is 1000 Euros * 100% = 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the expected value is (3000 Euros * 50%) + (-3000 Euros * 50%) = 0 Euros. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is the expected values of the two lotteries, which are 1000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions comparing the two lotteries and calculating the sum of the outcomes of Lottery B, which resulted in 0. They also considered the difference between gaining 1000 Euros and losing 3000 Euros.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual justified their choice of Lottery A over Lottery B because the difference between gaining 1000 Euros and potentially losing 3000 Euros was too great. This suggests that the individual was influenced by the potential outcomes and their intuition about the risk involved.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (outcomes of Lottery B and the difference between potential gains and losses). While the individual did calculate a form of aggregate value for Lottery B (though not explicitly stated as an expected value), their focus was more on the intuition about the risk and the comparison of potential outcomes rather than a straightforward calculation of expected values.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) to the individual’s justification for the choice (focusing on the risk of losing a significant amount and the difference between potential gains and losses). The individual's justification does align with preferring a certain gain over a risky option that could result in a significant loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of expected value but is more intuitively and qualitatively reasoned.

Given these comparisons, the individual's decision process seems to have been influenced by the concept of avoiding significant loss and preferring a certain gain, which aligns with the outcome of applying the decision reason (since Lottery A has a higher expected value than Lottery B). However, the explicit calculation and consideration of expected values as the primary decision criterion are not clearly stated in the verbal report. The individual's process was more intuitive and focused on the potential risks and outcomes rather than a direct comparison of expected values.

20,"Ein Verlust von 6000 Euro ist mir nicht den Erhalt von 6000E wert. Dann bleibe ich lieber bei der bis jetzt erhaltenen Summe an Geld. Ich bin nicht bereit so viel Verlust für so viel Gewinn zu riskieren. Allerdings wäre es natürlich auch interessant zu wissen, wie ich agieren würde wenn ich sehen klönnte wie viel Geld ich zur Verfügung hätte. Ich denke dies würde meine Entscheidung eventuell sogar ins Wanken bringen.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions provided and give your FINAL ASSESSMENT in the requested format.assistant

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the expected value of each lottery. For Lottery B, the expected value is (6000 * 0.5) + (-6000 * 0.5) = 0 Euros. For Lottery A, the expected value is (0 * 1) = 0 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same expected value (0 Euros), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries.

Step 2: The verbal report indicates that the individual considered the potential loss and gain of Lottery B and decided that the potential loss was not worth the potential gain. They stated a preference for maintaining their current amount of money, implying a risk-averse attitude. The individual also mentioned that knowing their current amount of money might influence their decision. The justification for the choice seems to be based on the individual's risk tolerance and the perceived value of avoiding a potential loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (expected values) with that considered by the individual (potential loss and gain, risk tolerance), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the expected values of the lotteries. Instead, they focused on the potential outcomes and their personal risk tolerance. The decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher expected value) does not align with the individual's justification for the choice (avoiding potential loss and maintaining current wealth). Since the individual's reasoning process does not explicitly involve calculating or comparing expected values, it seems unlikely that the decision reason was used.
