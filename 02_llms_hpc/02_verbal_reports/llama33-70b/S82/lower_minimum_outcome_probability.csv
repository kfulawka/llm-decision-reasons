STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 1%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery, which is 0% for Lottery A (since 0 Euros is not an outcome) and 1% for Lottery B. Thus, the decision reason can be applied and prefers Lottery A because it has a lower probability (effectively 0%) of its minimum outcome (which is not applicable in this case since the minimum outcome of Lottery A is its only outcome) compared to Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of a relatively high gain in Lottery A, the low probability (1%) of no gain in Lottery B, and the high probability of a gain in Lottery B that is the same as in Lottery A. They also considered the potential maximum gain difference between the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified their choice by weighing the risk of no gain in Lottery B against the potential for a slightly higher maximum gain in Lottery B compared to Lottery A, concluding that the risk was not worth it for the potential extra gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the low probability of no gain in Lottery B but also focused on the comparison of potential gains and the risk involved, not solely on the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A due to its guaranteed outcome. The individual's justification also leads to the choice of Lottery A but is based on a broader consideration of risk and potential gain, not solely on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's decision process and justification share some elements with the decision reason, such as preferring Lottery A, but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not strictly follow the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome as the sole criterion. The individual considered a range of factors including potential gains and risks, not just the probability of the minimum outcome. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's not a perfect match, leading to an assessment that is more than uncertain (50) but not certain (100) that the decision reason was used."

STEPS: 

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 67%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros with a probability of 66%. This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assessing the verbal report, the individual considers that in both lotteries, it is most likely to neither win nor lose (which implies they recognize the high probability of the 0 Euro outcome in both). They note the difference in potential winnings is minimal (a difference of 100 Euros between the two potential winnings) and that the chances of winning in Lottery B are slightly higher (by 1 percentage point). The individual concludes the lotteries are roughly equal in value and made the decision spontaneously.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual, the individual does mention the probabilities of winning (implicitly recognizing the probability of not winning, which is the probability of the minimum outcome) and compares them, noting a slight difference. However, the focus of the decision reason is specifically on the probability of the minimum outcome, which is not the central comparison made by the individual. The individual's justification for the choice seems to lean more towards the overall value and the slight difference in winning probabilities rather than focusing solely on the probability of the minimum outcome as the decision reason dictates. Therefore, while there's some alignment in considering probabilities, the decision reason's specific rule does not directly match the individual's justification for the choice.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20 

This assessment reflects that while the individual does consider probabilities and notes differences between the lotteries, the specific focus and rule of the decision reason (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome) are not clearly applied in the individual's decision-making process as described in the verbal report. The individual's decision seems more based on an overall comparison of potential winnings and their probabilities rather than specifically on the probability of the minimum outcome."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 20% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 3000 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 20% probability.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we can proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered that Lottery A brings a high, certain gain, while Lottery B has a possibility of no gain (or neither gain nor loss, as the individual mentions), which is not entirely unlikely. The individual also considered the difference in potential gains between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification is based on the risk associated with Lottery B, where the potential gain only slightly exceeds that of Lottery A (by 1000 Euros), and the individual did not want to take this risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk (possibility of no gain) in Lottery B, which aligns with the concept of considering the probability of the minimum outcome, although the individual does not explicitly mention probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A over B is based on the risk (or probability of not gaining) associated with B, which implies a preference for the lottery with a more certain (or less risky) outcome. This aligns with the decision reason’s rule, as Lottery A has a 0% probability of the minimum outcome being 0 Euros (since its minimum outcome is 3000 Euros with 100% probability), which is lower than Lottery B's 20% probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
The individual's consideration of the risk and certainty of outcomes, and their justification for choosing the lottery with the guaranteed higher minimum outcome, closely aligns with the decision reason's rule. However, the individual does not explicitly mention comparing the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, while it is likely that the decision reason was used, it is not certain."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we follow the step-by-step approach as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%, and in Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a probability of 80%. The information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered that both lotteries were roughly equal in terms of overall value, noting that with high probability, one would neither gain nor lose in both cases. They also noted the potential for a slightly higher gain in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification seems to lean on the spontaneity of the decision and a vague sense of equivalence between the lotteries, with a mention of the potential for a higher gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros in both cases), which is 75% for Lottery A and 80% for Lottery B. The individual, however, discusses the overall equivalence of the lotteries and the potential for higher gain, without explicitly mentioning the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome (which would be Lottery A in this case), based on the probabilities of not winning. The individual's justification does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the probability of not winning (or the minimum outcome), but rather on a general sense of equivalence and potential gain.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The verbal report does not provide clear evidence that the individual considered the specific probabilities of the minimum outcomes or used the rule of preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome as the basis for their decision. While the individual does mention aspects related to the lotteries, such as the high probability of not gaining and the potential for a higher gain in one lottery, these do not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. Therefore, it is unlikely that the decision reason was used by the individual, but there is a slight possibility due to the vague nature of the verbal report."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery, preferring the one with the lower probability of this minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a 10% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros but with a 55% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluating the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the high probability of making a good gain with Lottery A and noted that while Lottery B offers a potentially higher gain, it comes with a significantly lower probability. They also mention that with Lottery B, there's a higher than 50% chance of winning nothing.
Second, evaluating the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual finds Lottery A more attractive due to its higher probability of a good outcome and lower risk of winning nothing.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 10% for Lottery A and 55% for Lottery B. The individual discusses the probabilities of winning and the risk of winning nothing, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which is Lottery A. The individual prefers Lottery A because it has a higher probability of a good gain and a lower risk of winning nothing, which indirectly reflects a preference for the lower probability of the minimum outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason, as they both lead to preferring Lottery A due to its lower probability of the minimum (worst) outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80"
6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For both lotteries, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros. In Lottery B, the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) is 99.9%, and in Lottery A, it is 99.8%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (0 Euros) in both lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual considered that both lotteries are highly unlikely to result in a win or loss, noting the possible win in Lottery A is higher but also much less probable. The individual seems to focus on the high improbability of winning in both lotteries and compares the potential gains and their probabilities.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The individual's justification seems to hinge on the idea that since a win is highly unlikely in both cases, the difference in the potential winnings and their probabilities is not significant enough to strongly prefer one lottery over the other based on the probability of winning. The individual implies that the higher potential gain in one lottery could be chosen despite its lower probability of occurring, given that a win is not expected anyway.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, we compare the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (high improbability of winning, comparison of potential gains and their probabilities). The individual's considerations do not explicitly focus on the probabilities of the minimum outcomes but rather on the probabilities and amounts of the potential gains.
Second, we compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (seems to prioritize the potential for gain despite its low probability, considering a win is highly unlikely in both cases). The individual's justification does not directly reflect the decision reason's rule, as it does not explicitly mention preferring a lottery based on the lower probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The verbal report does not indicate that the individual used the decision reason that prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's considerations and justifications focus more on the potential gains and their probabilities rather than the probabilities of the minimum outcomes, which is the core of the decision reason in question. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
7,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with an 80% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum (and only) outcome is -3000 Euros with a 100% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 80% chance of losing 4000 Euros.
- Lottery B: 100% chance of losing 3000 Euros.
The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has a lower probability (80%) of its minimum outcome compared to Lottery B (100%).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considers that both lotteries likely result in losses, with Lottery B having a lesser loss amount than Lottery A. They also note that Lottery A has a 20% chance of neither gaining nor losing, which is not present in Lottery B. The individual mentions the higher probable loss in Lottery A compared to Lottery B but decides to take this risk for a chance to neither gain nor lose.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual's justification seems to focus on the trade-off between the magnitude of potential losses and the presence of a chance to break even in Lottery A, which is not available in Lottery B. They seem to prioritize this aspect over the absolute probability of the minimum outcome.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considers the magnitude of losses and the chance to break even, which aligns partially with the concept of outcomes but does not directly address the probability of the minimum outcome as the sole deciding factor.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prioritizes the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would lead to preferring Lottery A. The individual's justification, however, seems to weigh the potential benefits of avoiding any loss (in 20% of the cases) against the higher loss in Lottery A, indicating a more nuanced decision process that does not solely focus on the probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's decision process, as described, does not directly align with the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. While they do consider aspects of the lotteries that relate to outcomes and their probabilities, their justification suggests a more complex evaluation that includes the magnitude of losses and the presence of a no-loss outcome, rather than solely the probability of the minimum outcome. Thus, it's unlikely that the decision reason was the primary basis for their choice."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 20% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes: 25% for Lottery A and 20% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considers the risk of a relatively high loss in both lotteries and notes that the loss risk is somewhat lower in Lottery B compared to Lottery A. They also acknowledge that while the possible loss in Lottery B is higher by 1000 Euros, the lower probability of a loss in Lottery B compensates for this difference. The individual's justification for their choice focuses on the comparison of the probabilities of incurring a loss in each lottery and how the difference in these probabilities outweighs the difference in the magnitude of the potential losses.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (probabilities of the minimum outcomes) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of incurring a loss and their impact on the decision), it appears that the individual is considering similar aspects. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's justification that emphasizes the lower loss risk in Lottery B as a decisive factor, despite the higher potential loss. This suggests that the individual's deliberation process aligns with the decision reason's criteria for preferring one lottery over the other.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 45%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a probability of 90%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities of the minimum outcomes: 45% for Lottery A and 90% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of a loss (minimum outcome) in both lotteries and compared the probabilities of these losses. Specifically, they noted that a loss could occur in both lotteries but with different probabilities.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A to avoid a loss as much as possible, considering that the loss in Lottery A, although potentially larger, occurs with a significantly lower probability than the loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of the probability of a loss in both lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, and the individual chose Lottery A because it has a lower probability of the minimum outcome (loss), even though the loss is larger. This indicates that the individual's justification aligns with the rule of the decision reason.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 0.1% probability, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 0.2% probability. Since both lotteries have the same minimum outcome of 0 Euros with high probabilities (99.9% for A and 99.8% for B), but the decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum negative outcome, the relevant information is the probability of -6000 Euros for A (0.1%) and -3000 Euros for B (0.2%). This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual notes that both lotteries have a near certainty of resulting in 0 Euros but also considers the loss probabilities and expected losses. Specifically, they mention that Lottery B's loss probability is twice that of Lottery A but still very low, and they consider the expected loss.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justifies choosing Lottery B because, despite having a higher loss probability than A, the expected loss is significantly lower, making B seem more advantageous.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum (negative) outcome. The individual, however, considers not just the probability of the loss but also the expected loss, which implies considering the magnitude of the loss as well as its probability.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual, however, chooses based on the perceived advantage of a lower expected loss, not solely on the probability of the minimum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not strictly follow the decision reason provided, as they considered the magnitude of potential losses in addition to their probabilities, and their justification is based on the expected loss rather than just the probability of the minimum outcome.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 500 Euros with 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with 50% probability. The relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 500 Euros with 100% probability.
- Lottery B: Minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 50% probability.
This information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certainty of the gain with Lottery A (500 Euros) and the scenario with Lottery B where there's a 50% chance of neither gain nor loss (implying the 0 Euro outcome).

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by mentioning that the higher gain chance (in Lottery B) did not outweigh the risk associated with the possibility of not gaining anything. This implies the individual was considering the trade-off between the potential gain and the risk of not gaining.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the certainty of gain in Lottery A and the risk of no gain in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the minimum outcomes.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implies a consideration of the risk (probability of the minimum outcome) in making their decision, suggesting that the risk of getting 0 Euros in Lottery B was a significant factor.

Based on these comparisons, the individual seems to have considered the probabilities of the minimum outcomes (or the absence of gain) in their deliberation process, which aligns with the decision reason's focus. However, the verbal report does not explicitly state that the individual preferred Lottery A solely because it had a lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros). The individual's justification mentions the risk not being outweighed by the higher gain chance, which suggests a consideration of the trade-offs rather than a strict application of the decision reason.

The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -1000 Euros with a 50% probability.
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -500 Euros with a 100% probability.
The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the minimum outcomes and their respective probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the fact that Lottery B would result in a loss of 500 Euros with certainty, and Lottery A had a 50% chance of not making a loss but also a possibility of a higher loss (-1000 Euros).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified the choice by mentioning that Lottery A had at least a 50% chance of not resulting in a loss, which made it more appealing compared to the certain loss of 500 Euros in Lottery B. The individual also acknowledged the potential for a higher loss in Lottery A but seemed to find it acceptable in the context of the certain loss in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the probabilities of outcomes, specifically focusing on the aspect that Lottery A had a chance of not resulting in a loss, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the appeal of having a 50% chance of avoiding a loss in Lottery A, which suggests a preference based on the probability of avoiding the minimum outcome, aligning with the decision reason’s rule.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with the decision reason, as they focused on the probability of avoiding a loss (or the minimum outcome) and preferred Lottery A for this reason.

The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 75%. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is also 0 Euros, but with a probability of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery A: 0 Euros with 75% probability
- Lottery B: 0 Euros with 50% probability
This information is relevant to the decision reason as it allows for a comparison of the probabilities of the minimum outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered the probability of winning (or not winning) in both lotteries, noting that Lottery B had a 50% chance of winning something, implying a consideration of the probability of not winning (0 Euros) as well.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it seemed better for making any gain, given its higher overall chance of winning something compared to Lottery A, even if the potential win in Lottery A could be higher.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), which is 75% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B. The individual considered the overall chance of winning something, which indirectly relates to the probability of not winning (0 Euros), but the focus is slightly different. The individual's consideration is more about the chance of winning rather than specifically the probability of the minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery B (50% chance of 0 Euros). The individual preferred Lottery B because it offered a better chance of winning something, which aligns with preferring lower odds of the minimum outcome (0 Euros) but is not explicitly stated as such.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 60
The individual's reasoning aligns with the decision reason in preferring Lottery B due to its lower probability of the minimum outcome (0 Euros), but the verbal report does not explicitly state that the decision was based on the probability of the minimum outcome. The focus on the chance of winning something in the verbal report indirectly supports the decision reason but does not perfectly match its criteria. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it's not a perfect match, leading to a score above the midpoint but not at certainty."

For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a 25% probability. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -4000 Euros with a 25% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B has a 25% chance of its minimum outcome (-6000 Euros).
- Lottery A has a 25% chance of its minimum outcome (-4000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of not making losses (which can be interpreted as the probability of avoiding the minimum outcome) and the magnitude of potential losses in both lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the probability of not making losses was deemed higher, despite acknowledging that the potential losses in Lottery A were somewhat to significantly lower. The individual prioritized avoiding losses.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome, which aligns with the individual's consideration of avoiding losses (implicitly, the probability of the minimum outcome). However, the individual also considered the magnitude of losses, which is not part of the decision reason.

The individual's justification, while emphasizing avoiding losses (which aligns with preferring lower probability of the worst outcome), also mentions the magnitude of losses as a factor, which introduces a consideration not directly addressed by the decision reason.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 50
The individual's focus on avoiding losses and the implicit consideration of the probability of the minimum outcome align with the decision reason. However, the additional consideration of the magnitude of losses introduces ambiguity, making it uncertain whether the decision reason was the primary or sole basis for the choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we follow the steps as outlined:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 99.9%, and for Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 5 Euros with a probability of 0% since it guarantees at least 5 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are:
- Lottery A: Minimum outcome of 0 Euros with 99.9% probability.
- Lottery B: No minimum outcome below 5 Euros, as it guarantees 5 Euros with 100% probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the low probability (0.1%) of winning in Lottery A and the guaranteed outcome of Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified choosing Lottery B because it offers a guaranteed, albeit small, win, which seemed more realistic than hoping for the low-probability high win in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual focused on the low probability of winning in Lottery A and the guarantee of Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome (in this case, implicitly recognizing Lottery B has no risk of the minimum outcome being below 5 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery B because it guarantees a win, implying a preference for the option that avoids the higher probability of the minimum (0 Euros) outcome in Lottery A.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 100
The individual's reasoning closely aligns with the decision reason provided, focusing on the avoidance of the high-probability minimum outcome in Lottery A and preferring the guaranteed outcome in Lottery B. This suggests that the individual used a reasoning process consistent with the decision reason to make their decision."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -5 Euros with a 100% probability. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -5000 Euros with a 0.1% probability. The information relevant to the decision reason (the probabilities of the minimum outcomes) can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certain loss of Lottery A, the possibility of no loss or gain in Lottery B, the magnitude of the potential loss in Lottery B, and its very low probability (incorrectly stated as 0.01% instead of 0.1%).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery B because the significant loss, although large, has a very low probability of occurring, essentially treating it as if it would ""quasi nie"" (almost never) happen.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of the significant loss in Lottery B and its implications, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome, a key aspect of the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual chose Lottery B because the large loss, despite being the minimum outcome, has a very low probability, which implicitly suggests preferring the lottery (B) with the lower probability of its minimum outcome over the certain loss of Lottery A.

Given these comparisons, it appears the individual's reasoning process aligns with the decision reason's rule, focusing on the probability of the minimum outcome as a critical factor in the decision-making process.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80 
This assessment reflects a high likelihood that the decision reason was used, given the alignment between the individual's justification and the decision reason's focus on the probability of the minimum outcome. However, it's not a perfect match due to the individual's misstatement of the probability and the emphasis on the ""quasi nie"" occurrence of the loss, which introduces some uncertainty about the precise nature of their decision-making process."

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem because the information relevant to the reason, namely the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery, can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1500 Euros with 0% probability of getting less (since it's a certain outcome) and 100% probability of getting exactly this amount. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a 0% probability of its minimum outcome (since its outcome is fixed and there's no chance of getting less), and Lottery B has a 50% probability of its minimum outcome.

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual considered the fact that Lottery A includes a certain gain, while Lottery B carries a risk of losing twice the amount that could be won in A, with this loss occurring at a 50% probability. The individual's justification for their choice seems to hinge on the perceived risk associated with Lottery B being too high, especially in relation to the potential loss.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual, it's clear that the individual focused on the risk aspect, specifically the potential for a significant loss in Lottery B. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome, which would be Lottery A since it has a 0% probability of getting less than its stated outcome. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A because the risk of loss in Lottery B was ""too high"" aligns with the concept of avoiding the higher probability of a negative outcome, even though the verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities of minimum outcomes. The alignment between the decision reason's preference for the lower probability of a minimum outcome and the individual's risk aversion suggests that the decision reason may have been influential in the decision-making process.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. In Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability, and in Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 2000 Euros with a 0% probability of getting anything lower (since it's a guaranteed outcome). Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: 
- Lottery A has a 50% probability of its minimum outcome (-3000 Euros).
- Lottery B has a 0% probability of getting an outcome lower than 2000 Euros, implying its minimum outcome (2000 Euros) is certain.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual:
The individual considered the certain gain in Lottery B, the 50% chance of a higher gain in Lottery A, and the 50% risk of a significant loss in Lottery A. They also considered the difference in gains between the two lotteries.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice:
The individual justified their choice by weighing the certain gain in Lottery B against the risky, higher potential gain and significant potential loss in Lottery A, concluding that the difference in potential gains was not enough to justify taking the risk.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual:
The individual considered the risk (probability of a significant loss) in Lottery A and the certainty of the gain in Lottery B, which aligns with considering the probability of the minimum outcome in each lottery.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice:
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual's justification implicitly prefers Lottery B because it avoids the significant risk (50% probability of a high loss) present in Lottery A, which aligns with preferring a lower probability of the minimum outcome.

Based on these comparisons, the individual's decision-making process seems to align with the decision reason, as they prioritized avoiding a significant loss (which is directly related to the probability of the minimum outcome) over the potential for a higher gain.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the provided steps.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is 1000 Euros with a 0% probability of losing (since it's a guaranteed win) and a 100% probability of winning 1000 Euros. For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is -3000 Euros with a 50% probability. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is:
- Lottery A: 0% probability of losing (minimum outcome of -3000 Euros is not applicable, but the concept here is about the risk of the worst outcome, which in A's case is not a loss but a guaranteed gain).
- Lottery B: 50% probability of the minimum outcome (-3000 Euros).

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A has a 100% chance of winning, while Lottery B has a risk of losing a high sum, even though there's also a 50% chance of winning it. The individual focused on the risk of loss associated with Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual justified choosing Lottery A over Lottery B because the risk of loss in Lottery B was perceived as too high, despite the potential for a higher gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the risk of loss in Lottery B and the guaranteed win in Lottery A, which aligns with focusing on the worst-case scenario or minimum outcome.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. The individual preferred Lottery A because it had no risk of loss, implying a preference for the option with effectively a ""lower probability"" of the minimum (worst) outcome, which in this context means no loss at all.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual's decision-making process aligns with considering the probability of the worst outcome (or minimum outcome) for each lottery and choosing based on that consideration.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the probability of the minimum outcome of each lottery and prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum outcome. 
For Lottery A, the minimum outcome is -6000 Euros with a probability of 50%. 
For Lottery B, the minimum outcome is 0 Euros with a probability of 100%, but since it's the minimum and maximum outcome, it has no downside risk in the context of losing money.
The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability of the minimum outcome for each lottery: 50% for Lottery A's -6000 Euros and 0% for any negative outcome in Lottery B, as its minimum outcome is 0 Euros.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: 
The individual considered that Lottery B brings no profit or loss, implying they recognized its neutral outcome. For Lottery A, they considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros, acknowledging it as an extremely high sum to lose.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The individual justified their choice by emphasizing the significant weight of the potential loss in Lottery A, which they felt could not be outweighed by the chance to win 6000 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: 
The decision reason focuses on the probability of the minimum outcome. The individual considered the risk (implied probability and impact) of the negative outcome in Lottery A but did not explicitly mention probabilities. However, their concern over the loss suggests an awareness of the downside risk, which aligns with considering the minimum outcome's impact.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: 
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the lower probability of the minimum (negative) outcome. The individual's justification emphasizes the significant potential loss in Lottery A, suggesting a preference for avoiding the higher risk of a negative outcome, which aligns with preferring a lower probability of the minimum outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 80
This assessment indicates a high likelihood that the decision reason was used by the individual, as their justification for the choice aligns with the preference for the lower probability of the minimum outcome, even though the verbal report does not explicitly mention probabilities. The individual's focus on the risk of losing a significant amount in Lottery A and the preference for the certainty of no loss in Lottery B suggests that the decision reason's core principle (avoiding the higher probability of a negative outcome) was influential in their decision-making process."
