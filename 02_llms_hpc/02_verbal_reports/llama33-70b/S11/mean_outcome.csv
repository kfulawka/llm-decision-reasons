Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is 2400 Euros since there is only one outcome. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is calculated as (2500 + 2400 + 0) / 3 = 4900 / 3 = 1633.33 Euros. Thus, the decision reason can be applied.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A (100% chance of 2400 Euros) and the uncertainty in Lottery B, including the 1% chance of 0 Euros and the other outcomes. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was based on the desire for security, given that Lottery A offered a fixed gain, whereas Lottery B had a small chance of resulting in 0 Euros, and the other outcomes were similar or equal to the gain in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (certainty of outcomes, specific probabilities, and outcome values), it appears the individual did not directly consider the mean outcomes as calculated by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (focusing on security and avoiding the risk of a 0 Euro outcome), it is clear that the individual's decision-making process did not align with the decision reason's rule, as the individual prioritized certainty over the mean outcome value.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2400 + 0) / 2 = 1200 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (2500 + 0) / 2 = 1250 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case is Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the percentage chance of achieving a high outcome in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed there was a higher percentage chance of achieving a high outcome with Lottery A compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (percentage chance of achieving a high outcome): The individual's focus was on the probability of achieving a high outcome, not directly on calculating or comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification for the choice (preferring the lottery with a perceived higher chance of a high outcome): The decision reason specifically calculates and compares mean outcomes, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's justification is based on the probability of achieving a high outcome, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, whereas the individual's justification is based on the perceived higher probability of achieving a high outcome with Lottery A. This discrepancy suggests that the individual did not use the given decision reason to make their choice."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the specified decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the calculation is (3000) / 1 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, it is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in Lottery B, mentioning a ""70% Chance auf Gewinn"" (70% chance of winning), which seems to be an error since the actual probability of winning (receiving 4000 Euros) in Lottery B is 80%. The individual chose Lottery A because of a perceived lower chance of winning in Lottery B.

Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual's justification is based on the perceived probability of winning in Lottery B, not on the calculation of mean outcomes as described by the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which is not mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual discusses probabilities.

Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason's rule is to prefer the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which is not aligned with the individual's justification that is based on a misperceived probability of winning.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning in Lottery B, not on calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the two lotteries.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (4000 + 0) / 2 = 2000 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of earning 3000 Euros in Lottery A compared to Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they believed the probability of earning 3000 Euros was higher in Lottery A than in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which is calculated based on the outcomes alone. In contrast, the individual considered the probability of earning a specific amount, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A based on a comparison of probabilities, not mean outcomes.

For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probabilities and the amounts to be won in each lottery, specifically comparing the 90% chance of winning 3000 Euros in Lottery A to the 45% chance of winning 6000 Euros in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because the chance of winning was higher (90% vs. 45%).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report.

The decision reason calculates the mean outcome of each lottery by adding all outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 + 0) / 2 = 1500 Euros. This information is relevant to the decision reason and can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probabilities of winning in each lottery, noting that Lottery B has a higher probability of winning (0.2%) compared to Lottery A (0.1%).
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery B was based on the higher probability of winning, not on the calculation of mean outcomes as described in the decision reason.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of winning), it's clear they focused on different aspects.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preferring the lottery with the higher probability of winning), the two do not align. The individual did not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000) / 1 = -3000 Euros. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which in this case would be Lottery A since -2000 is higher than -3000. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered that Lottery A had two possible outcomes, while Lottery B had only one. They also considered the probability of not losing money (20% chance of getting 0 Euros) in Lottery A and the certainty of losing money in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it offered a 20% chance of not losing money (getting 0 Euros), which was preferable to the certain loss of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason is based on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, but the individual's justification does not mention calculating or comparing mean outcomes. Instead, the individual focuses on the number of outcomes and the specific probabilities of certain outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but the individual's choice is based on avoiding a certain loss and having a chance to not lose money, not on comparing mean outcomes.
Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason to make the decision, as their justification does not align with the calculation and comparison of mean outcomes.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, calculated by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, ignoring their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-4000 + 0) / 2 = -2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. Since the mean outcome of Lottery B is higher than that of Lottery A, according to this reason, Lottery B should be preferred.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the probability of landing on 0 Euros in each lottery. 
Second, the individual's justification for the choice was based on the higher probability of landing on 0 Euros in Lottery A, which led to their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities of landing on 0 Euros), it appears the individual focused on probabilities rather than mean outcomes as defined by the decision reason.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preference based on mean outcome) to the individual's justification (preference based on probability of landing on 0 Euros), the two do not align. The decision reason suggests preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), but the individual's justification does not mention mean outcomes at all.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-3000 + 0) / 2 = -1500 Euros. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome (-1500 Euros is higher than -3000 Euros). The relevant information for this decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the percentage chance of winning (or not losing, as the outcomes are negative) in each lottery, mentioning that Lottery A had more percentage chances related to a ""Gewinn"" (win), which seems to be a misunderstanding since both lotteries' positive outcomes are actually losses. However, the statement likely intends to compare the probabilities of the non-zero outcomes.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because it was perceived to have more chances of a ""win"" (likely referring to the probability of the non-zero outcome) compared to Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, calculated by averaging the outcomes. In contrast, the individual considered the probabilities of the outcomes, not the mean outcomes themselves.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), whereas the individual chose Lottery A based on a perceived higher chance of a non-zero outcome, not the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason's focus on mean outcomes.

The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (1000 + 0) / 2 = 500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (500) / 1 = 500 Euros. Since both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this calculation, the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which is 500 Euros for both.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of winning in each lottery, specifically mentioning the 100% chance of winning with Lottery B and the 50:50 chance with Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a 100% chance of winning, implying that the certainty of the outcome was a key factor in their decision.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. Instead, the individual focuses on the probability of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome or is indifferent if the mean outcomes are equal. The individual’s justification, however, is based on the certainty of the outcome, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason as described. The individual's focus was on the probability of winning rather than the mean outcome of the lotteries.

The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, regardless of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (-500 Euros) / 1 = -500 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (-1000 Euros + 0 Euros) / 2 = -500 Euros. Thus, both lotteries have the same mean outcome according to this reason, which would suggest indifference.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of losing in Lottery A and the 50:50 chance of winning or losing in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because it offered a 50:50 chance to either win or lose, implying an attraction to the possibility of not losing (or potentially gaining, though gaining zero is not explicitly mentioned as a positive outcome in the verbal report).

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's considerations are more aligned with the probabilities and the concept of risk rather than the mean outcome calculated by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason would lead to indifference between the two lotteries since they have the same mean outcome, but the individual chose Lottery B based on a different rationale, focusing on the chance to avoid loss rather than the mean outcome.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The mean outcome for each lottery can be calculated as follows:
- Lottery A: (6000 + 2000 + 0) / 3 = 2666.67 Euros
- Lottery B: (6000 + 0) / 2 = 3000 Euros
The information relevant to the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery.

Step 2: The verbal report describes the individual’s deliberation process as considering the number of possible outcomes for each lottery and the probability of positive outcomes. The individual mentions that Lottery A has three possible outcomes, with two of them being positive, and that Lottery B has only two outcomes, with the positive outcome having a probability of 25%. The individual justifies the choice of Lottery A by mentioning the availability of three outcomes and the higher number of positive outcomes.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcome of each lottery) with that considered by the individual (number of outcomes and probability of positive outcomes), it appears that the individual did not directly consider the mean outcome of each lottery. The individual’s justification for the choice focuses on the number of outcomes and the probability of positive outcomes, rather than the mean outcome. The decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) does not match the individual’s justification (preferring the lottery with more outcomes and a higher number of positive outcomes).

For Lottery A, the outcomes are -6000 Euros and 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the outcomes are -4000 Euros, -2000 Euros, and 0 Euros. The mean for Lottery A is (-6000 + 0) / 2 = -3000 Euros. The mean for Lottery B is (-4000 - 2000 + 0) / 3 = -2000 Euros. Since the mean of Lottery B (-2000 Euros) is higher than that of Lottery A (-3000 Euros), according to the decision reason, Lottery B should be preferred. The information relevant to the decision reason (outcomes of the lotteries) can be derived from the lotteries' descriptions.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of ending up with 0 Euros, comparing the two lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because the probability of ending up with 0 Euros (instead of a negative amount) was higher in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean of the outcomes, while the individual considered the probability of avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome (Lottery B), whereas the individual preferred Lottery A based on the probability of avoiding a loss, not the mean outcome.

Given these comparisons, it appears that the individual did not use the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The individual's focus was on avoiding a loss (getting 0 Euros) rather than on the average value of the outcomes.

The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. The decision reason prefers Lottery B because it has a higher mean outcome.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros in Lottery B and mistakenly believed there was a 50:50 chance involved with Lottery B, which is not the case as described in the decision problem.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because of the 100% chance of winning 1500 Euros.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The individual did not explicitly consider the mean outcomes of the lotteries as described in the decision reason. Instead, they focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and misunderstood the probability structure of Lottery B.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual's justification is based on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B, not the calculation of mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's verbal report does not indicate that they used the decision reason that involves calculating the mean of all outcomes of each lottery to make their choice. The focus on the certainty of the outcome and the misunderstanding of Lottery B's probability structure suggest a different reasoning process. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the decision reason to make the decision, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the mean of all outcomes of each lottery, which is calculated by adding the outcomes of each lottery independent of their probabilities and dividing by the number of outcomes. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (2000) / 1 = 2000 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcomes of the two lotteries, which are 2000 Euros for Lottery A and 0 Euros for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, we evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the 100% chance of getting 2000 Euros with Lottery A and the 50:50 chance of getting either 3000 Euros or -3000 Euros with Lottery B.
Second, we evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual decided on Lottery A because of its certain outcome compared to the uncertain and potentially negative outcome of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (mean outcomes of the lotteries) with that considered by the individual (probabilities and outcomes), we see that the individual focused on the certainty of the outcome and the risk associated with Lottery B rather than explicitly calculating or comparing the mean outcomes.
Second, comparing the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the higher mean outcome) to the individual’s justification (focusing on the certainty and avoiding potential loss), we observe that the individual's justification does not directly align with the decision reason's rule of comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not indicate the use of the decision reason that involves calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries. The focus on certainty and risk avoidance does not directly relate to the calculation of mean outcomes independent of probabilities, which is central to the decision reason in question."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (3000 - 3000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 1000 / 1 = 1000 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is the mean outcome of each lottery, which can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the certainty of the outcome (100% chance of winning) in Lottery B and the uncertainty (50:50 chance) in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B because the win was certain (100% probability), contrasting with the 50:50 probability in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcomes of the lotteries, which are 0 Euros for Lottery A and 1000 Euros for Lottery B. The individual, however, focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery B and the uncertainty in Lottery A, not explicitly mentioning the mean outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, which would be Lottery B. The individual's justification is based on the certainty of the win, not the mean outcome of the lotteries.

Given these comparisons, it seems the individual's decision-making process was influenced by the certainty of the outcome rather than the calculation of mean outcomes as specified by the decision reason. Therefore, the decision reason, which is based on calculating and comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries, does not align with the individual's stated justification for choosing Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason calculates the mean of all outcomes of each lottery by adding the outcomes and dividing by the number of outcomes, independent of their probabilities. For Lottery A, the mean outcome is (6000 - 6000) / 2 = 0 Euros. For Lottery B, the mean outcome is 0 / 1 = 0 Euros. The relevant information for the decision reason is that both lotteries have the same mean outcome of 0 Euros when calculated in this specific manner.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of loss (getting into the minus) associated with Lottery A, specifically mentioning the 50:50 chance of experiencing a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery B to avoid getting into debt, highlighting the concern over the potential loss in Lottery A.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the mean outcome of the lotteries, which, as calculated, does not differentiate between the two lotteries. However, the individual's concern was the risk of loss, not the mean outcome as defined by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher mean outcome, but since both lotteries have the same mean outcome under this reason, it would suggest indifference. The individual, however, chose based on avoiding loss, not comparing mean outcomes.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision process, as described in the verbal report, focuses on avoiding loss rather than comparing the mean outcomes of the lotteries as defined by the decision reason. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual to make the decision."
