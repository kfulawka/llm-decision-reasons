importance sampling
"STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied strictly.
- Maximum magnitude outcome of Lottery A: 2500 Euros. The probability of 2500 Euros is 33%.
- Maximum magnitude outcome of Lottery B: 2400 Euros. The probability of 2400 Euros is 100%.
The relevant information about the outcomes and their probabilities can be derived strictly. 
Therefore, summarize the relevant information:
- Lottery A: Maximum magnitude outcome is 2500 Euros with a probability of 33%.
- Lottery B: Maximum magnitude outcome is 2400 Euros with a probability of 100%.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
- Compare the maximum magnitude outcomes weighted by their probabilities:
  - Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 0.33 = 825 Euros.
  - Lottery B: 2400 Euros * 1 = 2400 Euros.
- Since 2400 Euros (Lottery B weighted maximum magnitude outcome) is more favorable than 825 Euros (Lottery A weighted maximum magnitude outcome), the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

"STEPS:
1. Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
   - The relevant information for the decision reason is the maximum magnitude outcome of each lottery and the probability of achieving that outcome.

   - The information can be derived from the given lotteries, so we proceed to Step 2.

2. Apply the decision reason:
   - Compare the maximum magnitude outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
   - Lottery A: 2500 Euros * 0.33 = 825 Euros (expected weighted outcome).
