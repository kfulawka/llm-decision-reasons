STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 1%, 33%, and 66%, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 66% - 1% = 65%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% for one outcome, so the difference between the minimum and maximum probability is 100% - 100% = 0% (since there's only one outcome, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same). The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery: 65% for Lottery B and 0% for Lottery A.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B, indicating they considered the potential for not winning anything.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they were aware of and wanted to avoid the 1% chance of winning nothing in Lottery B. This implies their decision was influenced by the risk of not receiving any payout.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the risk of not winning anything (1% chance in Lottery B), not explicitly on the probability differences between the lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B. However, the individual chose Lottery A because of the risk associated with Lottery B, not because of comparing the probability differences between the two lotteries.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason provided, as they did not explicitly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. Instead, their choice was driven by the desire to avoid a specific risk.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 34% and the minimum is 0% (since the outcome of 0 Euros has a probability, but in the context of winning, 0% chance is considered for the minimum relevant outcome), and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 33% and the minimum is 0% (same reasoning). Thus, the difference for Lottery A is 34% - 0% = 34% and for Lottery B is 33% - 0% = 33%. The relevant information can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probabilities themselves.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the difference in the probability of winning between the two lotteries (1% more chance) and the difference in the potential winnings (100 Euros more in Lottery B).
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual preferred Lottery A because they valued the 1% higher chance of winning over the 100 Euros more offered by Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not directly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual focuses on the difference in winning probabilities between the two lotteries, not the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities within each lottery.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between its minimum and maximum probabilities. The individual's justification is based on preferring a higher chance of winning and does not directly relate to comparing the internal probability ranges of the lotteries.

Based on these comparisons, it appears the individual did not directly apply the decision reason as described. The decision reason is about the internal probability spread of each lottery, whereas the individual's decision is based on the comparative probabilities of winning between the two lotteries and the potential winnings.

STEPS: 

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100% (since there's only one outcome with 100% probability), resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 20% and the maximum probability is 80%, resulting in a difference of 60%. Therefore, the decision reason can be applied to this decision problem, and the relevant information is the differences in probability ranges for each lottery: 0% for Lottery A and 60% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. 
Second, the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is that it comes without the risk of earning nothing. This implies the individual focused on the certainty of the outcome in Lottery A and the risk associated with Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and then probabilities, focusing on risk), it appears the individual did consider probabilities but not explicitly in terms of the range or difference between minimum and maximum probabilities as the decision reason dictates.
Second, comparing the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) to the individual's justification (avoiding the risk of earning nothing), it's clear the individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule. The individual preferred the lottery with no risk (and thus a probability range difference of 0%), whereas the decision reason would prefer Lottery B due to its larger probability range difference.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 20%, resulting in a difference of 20%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 25%, resulting in a difference of 25%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities. 

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, the individual considered the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries. Second, the individual justified the choice of Lottery A by mentioning that the 5% difference (likely referring to the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries, 25% - 20% = 5%) was perceived as too small. 

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, the information relevant to the decision reason involves the differences in probabilities (20% for Lottery A and 25% for Lottery B), but the individual considered the difference in probabilities between the two lotteries (5%), not the differences within each lottery. Second, the decision reason’s rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (25% difference), but the individual chose Lottery A and justified it based on a different aspect (the 5% difference between the lotteries' probabilities). Based on these comparisons, it seems the individual did not use the decision reason as described to make the decision.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (or 3000 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (or 6000 Euros outcome, but since the other outcome is 0 Euros, we consider the lower probability associated with the non-zero outcome which is not directly relevant, hence we look at the probability of the 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (or 0 Euros outcome), resulting in a difference of 10%. Thus, the information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions comparing the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not provide a clear justification for the choice beyond comparing outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual compared outcomes and probabilities but did not specify calculating or considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: Since the verbal report does not provide a detailed justification for the choice and does not mention the specific rule of preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, it's unclear if the individual used this rule.

6,"STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001), resulting in a difference of 0.001. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0) and the maximum probability is 0.2% (or 0.002), resulting in a difference of 0.002. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the differences in probabilities for each lottery.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the two lotteries, noting that the chances of winning are very low for both.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because, given the low chances of winning in both lotteries, they preferred the lottery with the potentially larger, though unlikely, gain.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference in probabilities between the minimum and maximum outcomes of each lottery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report as a factor in the individual's decision-making process. The individual focuses on the comparison of outcomes and the low probabilities of winning.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B in this case (0.002 - 0.0 = 0.002 for B vs. 0.001 - 0.0 = 0.001 for A). However, the individual's justification is based on preferring the larger potential gain due to similarly low probabilities of winning, not on the difference in probability ranges.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's decision-making process, as described in the verbal report, does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason considers the difference in probability ranges, which is not mentioned or implied in the individual's justification for choosing Lottery A. Instead, the individual's choice is based on the preference for a larger potential gain given low winning probabilities, not on the difference in probability ranges between the lotteries. Therefore, it is certain that the decision reason was not used by the individual."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 80% and 20%, so the difference is 60%. For Lottery A, the probability is 100% (with an implicit 0% for any other outcome), so the difference is 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual. The individual mentions choosing Lottery B because they wanted to choose the chance to remain loss-free. This implies the individual considered the possibility of not losing (0 Euros with 20% probability in Lottery B) as a significant factor.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice. The justification is based on avoiding a loss, specifically the attraction to the 20% chance of not losing in Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual. The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the verbal report. The individual's focus is on the chance to remain loss-free, not on comparing probability ranges.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice. The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A (100% difference) over Lottery B (60% difference). However, the individual chose Lottery B based on a different criterion (the chance to avoid loss), not the probability difference.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0
The individual's reasoning as described in the verbal report does not align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is about comparing the range of probabilities, while the individual's choice is based on avoiding a loss, indicating the decision reason was not used."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 20% and 80%, giving a difference of 60%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, giving a difference of 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are the probability differences of 60% for Lottery A and 50% for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the probability of losing money in each lottery, specifically mentioning a ""Chance von 1/5"" (1 in 5 chance), which translates to 20%, the probability of losing in Lottery A.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they preferred having only a 1 in 5 chance of losing money.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities (60% for A, 50% for B), while the individual considered the probability of losing money (20% for A, 25% for B).
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probabilities (which would be Lottery A), but the individual's justification is based on preferring a lower probability of losing money, not explicitly the difference between probabilities.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (or 0 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 90% (-3000 Euros outcome), so the difference is 90%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 45% (-6000 Euros outcome) and the maximum probability is 55% (0 Euros outcome), so the difference is 10%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probability differences: 90% for Lottery A and 10% for Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we'll follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there's a 50% chance of 0 Euros, implying no loss) and the maximum probability is 50% (for both outcomes). However, interpreting the decision reason strictly, we look at the probabilities associated with the outcomes: Lottery A has outcomes with 50% probability each, so the minimum and maximum probabilities for specific outcomes are the same, but considering the reason's intent, we see it's about the range of probabilities for any outcome. For Lottery B, the outcome of -500 Euros has a 100% probability, so both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%. Thus, the difference for Lottery A, based on the strict interpretation of the rule, is 0% (50%-50%), and for Lottery B, it's 0% (100%-100%). However, considering the spirit of the decision reason, which seems to aim at identifying lotteries with a range of possible outcomes (in terms of probability), Lottery A offers a range (0% to 50% in terms of avoiding loss or not), while Lottery B does not (100% chance of loss). The relevant information for the decision reason, therefore, is the presence of a range in probabilities for Lottery A and the lack thereof for Lottery B.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the chance of not making a loss.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because of the chance to avoid any loss.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery, which relates to the variability or range of outcomes in terms of probability. The individual considered the chance of not making a loss, which aligns with preferring a lottery that offers a possibility (a range) of outcomes, including avoiding loss.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which could be interpreted as preferring the lottery with a range of possible outcomes (in terms of probability), like Lottery A. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A was the chance to avoid loss, which indirectly relates to the concept of preferring a lottery with a range of outcomes (since Lottery A offers a 50% chance of no loss, while Lottery B does not).

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's focus on the chance to avoid loss aligns somewhat with the concept of preferring a lottery that offers a range of outcomes (in terms of probability), but the verbal report does not explicitly mention considering the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The decision reason's technical application (focusing on the probability range) and the individual's justification (focusing on the chance of no loss) share a conceptual similarity but are not directly aligned. Therefore, while there's a slight connection, it's not strong enough to conclude the decision reason was directly used."

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference is 50%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the minimum is 25% and the maximum is 50%, making the difference 25%. Thus, the relevant information for the decision reason is: Lottery A has a 50% difference, and Lottery B has a 25% difference. The decision reason would prefer Lottery A because it has the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual mentions that Lottery B was chosen because it was associated with less risk.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is the perceived lower risk of Lottery B.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, while the individual talks about the risk associated with each lottery. The concept of risk is related but not directly equivalent to the probability differences considered by the decision reason.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference in probabilities (which would be Lottery A), but the individual chose Lottery B because it seemed less risky, not explicitly because of the probability differences.

Given these comparisons, the individual's reasoning does not directly align with the decision reason provided. The decision reason is about the difference in probabilities, while the individual's choice is justified by a general perception of risk, which does not necessarily correspond to the specific calculation of probability differences.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 25%, 25%, and 50%, so the difference between the maximum and minimum probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. For Lottery B, the probabilities are 25% and 75%, so the difference between the maximum and minimum probability is 75% - 25% = 50%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual compared the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The verbal report does not provide a detailed justification for the choice of Lottery B, only stating that it was chosen after comparing outcomes and probabilities.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities, but the verbal report does not explicitly mention this calculation or comparison.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery B (50% difference) over Lottery A (25% difference). The individual chose Lottery B, but the justification provided does not explicitly match the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 20
The individual's choice aligns with what the decision reason would suggest (preferring Lottery B due to its larger difference in probabilities), but the verbal report lacks explicit mention of calculating or comparing these probability differences as the basis for the decision. Therefore, while there is a coincidence between the chosen lottery and the preference of the decision reason, the report does not clearly indicate that the decision reason was the basis for the choice."

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% (or 0.001) and the maximum probability is 99.9% (or 0.999), making the difference 99.9% - 0.1% = 99.8%. For Lottery B, since the probability is 100% for the single outcome, both the minimum and maximum probabilities are 100%, making the difference 0%. The relevant information for the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' probabilities.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual mentions preferring to achieve a win rather than none, implying they considered the potential for winning in each lottery.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The justification provided is about preferring a potential win, without specific reference to the probabilities of the outcomes.

First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (potential for winning): The individual's focus was on achieving a win, not explicitly on the probability differences.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between minimum and maximum probability) to the individual’s justification (preferring a potential win): The decision reason specifically involves comparing probability ranges, which is not mentioned in the individual's justification.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. The information relevant to the decision reason is the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0.1% and the maximum probability is 99.9%, resulting in a difference of 99.8%. For Lottery B, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are both 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. 

Step 2: Evaluating the verbal report, the individual first compares the outcomes and then the probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery B is to prefer a minimal loss over the small chance of a large loss. This indicates the individual considered the potential losses and their associated probabilities in making the decision.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probabilities) with that considered by the individual (outcomes and their probabilities), it appears the individual focused more on the outcomes and their implications (minimal loss vs. large loss) rather than the probability differences themselves. The decision reason's rule prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, which would be Lottery A. However, the individual's justification does not mention or imply considering the range of probabilities as the basis for the decision. Instead, the focus was on the preference for avoiding a large potential loss, even if highly unlikely, in favor of a certain but minimal loss. This suggests the decision reason provided does not align with the individual's stated justification for choosing Lottery B.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual, we will follow the step-by-step process as outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the probabilities are 50% and 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0% as well, since there is only one probability value. However, to apply the reason, we must consider how it interprets the ""minimum and maximum probability"" for a lottery with a single outcome like Lottery B. Since Lottery B has a single outcome with 100% probability, its minimum probability is technically 0% (for any other outcome, which in this case does not exist) and its maximum is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. For Lottery A, the difference remains 0% because both outcomes have the same probability. Therefore, the decision reason would prefer Lottery B over Lottery A based on the difference in probability ranges.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
The verbal report states, ""Ich wählte Lotterie A, da es mir am sinnvolllsten erschien,"" which translates to ""I chose Lottery A because it seemed most sensible to me."" This report does not explicitly mention probabilities or the difference between minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries. The individual's justification for the choice is based on what ""seemed most sensible,"" without providing specific details about the deliberation process regarding probabilities or the decision reason's specific criteria.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (differences in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (what seemed ""most sensible""), there is no direct mention of probability differences in the verbal report. The individual's justification does not align with the decision reason's rule, which specifically considers the probability differences. Therefore, based on the information provided in the verbal report, it appears that the individual did not explicitly use the decision reason to make the decision.

STEPS: 
Step 1: The decision reason can be applied to the decision problem by evaluating the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 0% (since there is only one outcome with 100% probability) and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 100%. The relevant information for the decision reason is the difference in probability ranges for each lottery.

Step 2: The verbal report states that the individual chose Lottery A because they would definitely achieve a win. This indicates that the individual considered the certainty of the outcome of Lottery A in their deliberation process. The individual's justification for choosing Lottery A is based on the guarantee of a positive outcome.

Step 3: Comparing the information relevant to the decision reason (the difference in probability ranges) with that considered by the individual (certainty of a win), it appears that the individual did not explicitly consider the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. The individual's focus was on the guaranteed outcome of Lottery A rather than the probability ranges. Additionally, the decision reason's rule (preferring the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability) does not align with the individual's justification (choosing the lottery with a guaranteed win). The decision reason would actually prefer Lottery A due to its larger difference (100% - 0% = 100%) compared to Lottery B (50% - 50% = 0%), but the reasoning provided in the verbal report does not reflect this calculation or consideration.

STEPS: 
Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem. 
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 100% and the maximum probability is 100%, resulting in a difference of 0%. However, since the decision reason is based on the difference between the minimum and maximum probability, and both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the decision reason would be indifferent between the two lotteries if it were applied correctly. The relevant information for the decision reason is the probabilities of the outcomes of the lotteries.

Step 2: Assess the verbal report. 
First, evaluate and summarize information considered by the individual: The individual considered the second option (1000 Euros) of Lottery B to be too low compared to another unspecified option (2000 Euros) that is not present in the given decision problem.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they perceived the second option of Lottery B as unfavorable in comparison to an unrelated previous option.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual. 
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason requires the consideration of the probabilities of the lotteries, but the individual's verbal report does not mention probabilities. Instead, the individual focuses on the monetary outcomes.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but the individual's justification is based on comparing the monetary outcomes of the lotteries, not their probability distributions.

STEPS: 
To assess whether the individual used the given decision reason, we will follow the steps outlined.

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem.
The decision reason considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery B, the minimum probability is 50% and the maximum probability is 50%, resulting in a difference of 0%. For Lottery A, since there is only one outcome with 100% probability, the minimum and maximum probabilities are the same (100%), resulting in a difference of 0%. The information relevant to the decision reason can be derived from the lotteries' outcomes and probabilities, which are: 
- Lottery B: 0% difference between min and max probabilities
- Lottery A: 0% difference between min and max probabilities

Step 2: Assess the verbal report.
First, evaluate and summarize the information considered by the individual: The individual considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B.
Second, evaluate and summarize the individual’s justification for the choice: The individual chose Lottery A because they considered the risk of losing 6000 Euros with a 50% probability in Lottery B as too great.

Step 3: Assess whether the decision reason was used by the individual.
First, compare the information relevant to the decision reason with that considered by the individual: The decision reason focuses on the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of the lotteries, which is 0% for both lotteries. The individual, however, focused on the risk associated with the 50% probability of losing 6000 Euros in Lottery B, not directly comparing the probability ranges of the two lotteries.
Second, compare the decision reason’s rule to the individual’s justification for the choice: The decision reason prefers the lottery with the larger difference between the minimum and maximum probability, but since both lotteries have the same difference (0%), the reason would be indifferent. The individual, however, chose Lottery A due to the perceived high risk in Lottery B, which does not directly align with the decision reason’s rule.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: 0 
The individual's focus on the risk of losing a significant amount in Lottery B and their decision to choose Lottery A because of this risk does not align with the decision reason that considers the difference between the minimum and maximum probabilities of each lottery. Since the individual's justification does not reflect the application of the decision reason's rule, the assessment is that the decision reason was not used by the individual."
