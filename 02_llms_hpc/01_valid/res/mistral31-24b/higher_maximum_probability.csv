0,"each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability.STEPS:

Step 1: Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem in a strict manner.
The decision reason requires identifying the maximum probability of each lottery. For Lottery A, the maximum probability is 66%, and for Lottery B, the maximum probability is 100%. Both lotteries have a maximum probability that can be determined from the given information. Therefore, we can apply the decision reason.

Step 2: Apply the decision reason to the decision problem.
The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher maximum probability. Comparing the maximum probabilities, Lottery B has a maximum probability of 100%, while Lottery A has a maximum probability of 66%. Therefore, the decision reason prefers Lottery B.

1,"maximum probability of each lottery. The reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability.STEPS:
1. **Assess if the decision reason can be applied to the decision problem**:
   - The decision reason requires the maximum probability of each lottery, which can be derived directly from the given probabilities.
   - The maximum probability for Lottery A is 67% (the probability of winning 0 Euros).
   - The maximum probability for Lottery B is 66% (the probability of winning 0 Euros).
   - Therefore, the relevant information is:
     - Maximum probability of Lottery A = 67%
     - Maximum probability of Lottery B = 66%

2. **Apply the decision reason to the decision problem**:
   - The decision reason prefers the lottery with the higher value of maximum probability.
   - Comparing the maximum probabilities: 67% (Lottery A) vs. 66% (Lottery B).
   - Since 67% is greater than 66%, the decision reason prefers Lottery A.
